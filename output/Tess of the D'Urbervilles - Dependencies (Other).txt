The pair of legs were rickety, and
---
a patch being
---
who,, hummed a wandering tune
---
after another pace or two, halted, and
---
" Now, sir, begging your pardon; we met last market- day on this road
 about this time, and
---
I said' Good night,' and you made reply'_ Good
 night, Sir John_,' as now."


---
" I did," said the parson.


---
The parson rode a step or two nearer.


---
It was only my whim
---
and, after a moment's hesitation:" It
 was on account of a discovery. 
---
Do n't you really know,
 Durbeyfield,?"


---
as appears by Battle Abbey
 Roll
---
" Well it's true. 
---
Yes, that's the d'Urberville nose
 and chin-- a little debased. 
---
Branches of your family held manors over
 all this part of England
---
; their names appear in the Pipe Rolls in the
 time of King Stephen. 
---
in Edward the
 Second's time your forefather Brian was summoned to Westminster. 
---
You declined a little in Oliver
 Cromwell's time, but to no serious extent, and
---
Aye, there have been generations of Sir Johns among
 you, and
---
if knighthood were hereditary, like a baronetcy,
---
as it
 practically was in old times,
---
" Ye do n't say so!"


---
" there's hardly such another family in England
---
And how long
 hev this news about me been knowed, Pa'son Tringham?"


---
The clergyman explained.

---
that, as far, it had

" However, our impulses are too strong for our
 judgement sometimes. 
---
you might perhaps know something of
 it all the while
---
, that my family had seen

---
better days afore they came to Blackmoor
---
it to mean
---
that we had once kept two horses where we now
 keep only one
---
a wold graven seal
 at home, too; but, Lord, what's a spoon and seal?... 
---
Twas said... 
---
that my gr't- granfer had secrets, and
---
And where do we raise our smoke, now,
 parson,
---
if I may make so bold; I mean, where do we d'Urbervilles
 live?"


---
" You do n't live anywhere.
---
You are extinct-- as a county family."


---
" That's bad."


---
what the mendacious family chronicles in the male
 line
---
" Yes-- call extinct-- that is, gone down--."


---
" Then where do we lie?"


---
" You haven't any."


---
though you once had'em in abundance
---
" None;,, for you
 family consisted of numerous branches. 
---
as I said In this county there was a
 seat of yours at Kingsbere, and another at Sherton, and another in
 Millpond, and another at Lullstead, and another at Wellbridge."


---
" And shall we ever come into our own again?"


---
It is a fact of some interest to the
 local historian and genealogist, nothing more. 
---
There are several
 families among the cottagers of this county of almost equal lustre.

---
" But you'll turn back and? 
---
" Ah-- that I ca n't tell!"

 I better do about it, sir There's a very pretty brew in tap at The Pure
 Drop-- though,."


---
You've had enough
 already." 
---
In a few minutes a youth appeared
 in the distance,. 
---
The lath- like stripling frowned. 
---
You know my
 name!"


---
Do you
---
", do you? 
---
That's the secret
---
-- that's the secret!
---
that the secret is

as well as I know yours I'm going...  Well,
 Fred, I do n't mind telling you that I'm one of a
 noble race-- it has been just found out by me this present afternoon,
 P.M."

Sir John d'Urberville-- that's

" That is--. '.

if knights were baronets

which they be

Tis
 recorded in history all about me
---
Dost know of such a place, lad,
 as Kingsbere- sub- Greenhill?"


---
" Never you mind the place, boy
---
, that's not the question before us.

---
I've been there to Greenhill Fair."

 I mean when I was
 Under the church of that there parish lie my ancestors-- hundreds of
' em-- in coats of mail and jewels, in gr't lead coffins weighing tons
 and tons.

that's

when you've come
 to The Pure Drop Inn

they be, and
---
when you've done that goo on to my house with
 the basket, and.
---
As the lad stood in a dubious attitude
---
if they ca n't, black- pot
---
if they ca n't
 get that
---
, well chitterlings will do
---
the notes of a brass
 band were heard from the direction of the village.


---
" What's that?
---
Why, your da'ter is one o'
 the members."


---
will ye, and
---
The lad departed, and
---
Not a soul passed that way for a long
 while, and
---
the faint notes of the band were the only human sounds
 audible within the rim of blue hills.

II


 The village of Marlott lay amid the north- eastern undulations of the
 beautiful Vale of Blakemore, or Blackmoor, aforesaid, an engirdled
 and secluded region, for the most part untrodden as yet by tourist or
 landscape- painter, though within a four hours' journey from London.


---
It is a vale. 
---
whose acquaintance is
---
that surround it
---
An unguided ramble into its recesses in bad
 weather is apt to engender dissatisfaction with its narrow, tortuous,
 and miry ways.


---
This fertile and sheltered tract of country, in which the fields are
 never brown and. 
---
the springs never dry,
---
is bounded on the south by the
 bold chalk ridge that embraces the prominences of Hambledon Hill,
 Bulbarrow, Nettlecombe- Tout, Dogbury, High Stoy, and Bubb Down
---
who, after plodding northward for a score
 of miles over calcareous downs and corn- lands, suddenly reaches
 the verge of one of these escarpments,
---
, the sun blazes down upon fields so large as to give
 an unenclosed character to the landscape,, the
 hedges low and plashed, the atmosphere colourless. 
---
the lanes are white
---
Here, in the
 valley, the world seems
---
to be constructed upon a smaller and more
 delicate scale; the fields are mere paddocks,. 
---
that from
 this height their hedgerows appear a network of dark green threads
 overspreading the paler green of the grass
---
The atmosphere beneath
 is languorous, and. 
---
what artists call the
 middle distance partakes also of that hue,
---
while the horizon beyond
 is of the deepest ultramarine
---
Arable lands are few and limited
---
;
 with but slight exceptions the prospect is a broad rich mass of grass
 and trees,. 
---
Such is
 the Vale of Blackmoor.


---
The district is of historic, no less than of topographical interest.

---
The Vale was known in former times as the Forest of White Hart, from
 a curious legend of King Henry III's reign,
---
which the king
 had run down and
---
in which the killing by
 a certain Thomas de la Lynd of a beautiful white hart spared, was made the occasion of a heavy fine.

---
In those days, and till comparatively recent times, the country was
. 
---
Even now, traces of its earlier condition are.


---
that yet
 survive upon its slopes,
---
that shade so
 many of its pastures
---
The forests have departed, but
---
some old customs of their shades
 remain. 
---
Many, however, linger only in a metamorphosed or disguised
 form. 
---
The May- Day dance, for instance, was
---
as it was there
---
" club- walking," called.


---
It was an interesting event to the younger inhabitants of Marlott,
. 
---
though its real interest was not observed by the participators in the
 ceremony
---
The club of Marlott alone lived. 
---
It had walked for hundreds of years, if
 not as benefit- club, as votive sisterhood of some sort; and
---
it walked
 still.


---
The banded ones were all dressed in white gowns-- a gay survival from
 Old Style days, when cheerfulness and May- time were synonyms--. 
---
days
 before the habit of taking long views had reduced emotions to a
 monotonous average
---
Their first exhibition of themselves was in a
 processional march of two and two round the parish. 
---
Ideal and real
 clashed slightly for,
---
as the sun lit up their figures against the green
 hedges and creeper- laced house- fronts;
---
though the whole troop
 wore white garments
---
, no two whites were alike among them. 
---
Some
 approached pure blanching
---
; some had a bluish pallor
---
; some worn by the
 older characters( which had possibly lain by folded for many a year)
 and to a Georgian style.


---
the selection
 of the latter, had been an operation of personal care.


---
In a true view, perhaps, there was. 
---
the elder be passed
 over here for those under whose bodices
---
the life throbbed quick and
 warm.


---
Some had beautiful eyes,
---
others a beautiful
 nose, others a beautiful mouth and figure: few, if any, had all. 
---
A
 difficulty of arranging their lips in this crude exposure to public
 scrutiny, an inability to balance their heads, and to dissociate
 self- consciousness from their features, was apparent in them, and
.


---
as each and all of them were warmed without by the sun
---
which,
 though perhaps starving to nothing, still lived on,
---
as hopes will
---
They were all cheerful, and many of them merry.


---
They came round by The Pure Drop Inn, and
---
who could boast of such
 a pronounced adornment
---
This was the cheerful servant of that establishment,
.

---
, that's all
---
because our own horse has
---
that they had
---
they said no more, and. 
---
order again prevailed
---
By the time
 the spot was reached
---
the characteristic
 intonation of that dialect for this district being the voicing
 approximately rendered by the syllable UR, probably as rich an
 utterance as any to be found in human speech
---
to which this syllable was native
---
The pouted- up deep red
 mouth had hardly as yet settled
 into its definite shape, and
---
Yet few knew, and
---
Nothing was seen or. 
---
the club having
 entered the allotted space,
---
dancing began
---
when the
 hour for the close of labour drew on
---
, the masculine inhabitants of
 the village, together with other idlers and pedestrians, gathered
 round the spot, and.


---
Their general likeness to each other, and
 their consecutive ages, would almost have suggested. 
---
that they might
 be,
---
what in fact they were, brothers
---
The eldest wore the white tie,
 high waistcoat, and thin- brimmed hat of the regulation curate
---
; the
 second was the normal undergraduate
---
These three brethren told casual acquaintance.


---
that they were spending
 their Whitsun holidays in a walking tour through the Vale of
 Blackmoor,
---
their course being south- westerly from the town of Shaston
 on the north- east
---
They leant over the gate by the highway, and. 
---
The two elder of
 the brothers were
---
What are you going, Angel
---
" Look here; I wo n't walk another inch with you,!"" I am inclined to go and have a fling with them.  Why not all of
 us-- just for a minute or two-- it will not detain us long?"


---
" No-- no; nonsense!" said the first. 
---
a troop
 of country hoydens-- suppose! 
---
we should be seen
---
it
 will be dark, and
---
before we get to Stourcastle
---
there's no place we
 can sleep at nearer than that
---
Come along, or; besides, we must get through another
 chapter of_
---
A Counterblast to Agnosticism_ before we turn in

"
---
This is a thousand pities
---
" Where are your partners, my dears?"


---
" They've not left off work yet
---
" They'll be here by and by. 
---
Till then, will you be one, sir?"


---
But what's one among so many!"


---
which was not the speaker,
---
did it
 happen
---
whatever it was
---
Yet such was the force of
 example.


---
who had not hastened
---
The church clock struck,
---
when suddenly the student said
---
,
 whose own large orbs wore,. 
---
as they had whirled
---
They seemed.


---
This white shape stood apart
 by the hedge alone. 
---
Trifling as the matter was
---
However, it could not be helped, and
---
they did

---
It was not
 till the rays of the sun.


---
when they became fierce
---
the parental cottage lay.


---
They were a regular series of thumpings from the interior of
 the house, occasioned by the violent rocking of a cradle upon a stone
 floor, to which movement a feminine voice kept time by singing, in a
 vigorous gallopade, the favourite ditty of
---
the song would cease simultaneously for a
 moment, and
---
an exclamation at highest vocal pitch would take the
 place of the melody.


---
" God bless thy diment eyes! 
---
After this invocation the rocking and the singing would recommence,
 and. 
---
the" Spotted Cow" proceed as before
---
So matters stood.


---
which had now, as always
---
Out of that tub had come the day
 before
---
which had been wrung up and
---
The cradle- rockers had done hard duty for so many
 years, under the weight of so many children, on that flagstone floor,

---
that they were worn nearly flat, in consequence of which
---
Nick- knock, nick- knock, went the cradle
---
the candle- flame stretched
 itself tall, and
---
; began jigging up and down; the water dribbled from
 the matron's elbows, and
---
the song galloped on to the end of the
 verse,. 
---
No ditty floated into Blackmoor Vale from the outer
 world but
---
"," said the daughter gently.

---

---
you
 had finished long ago
---
what have happened
---
when th'st know
---
who had passed the Sixth
 Standard in the National School under a London- trained mistress

" That wer all a part of the larry! 
---
We've been found
---

---
Do n't that make
 your bosom plim? '
---
as people supposed
---
" O yes! ' Tis thoughted. 
---
that great things may come o't

No doubt a
 mampus of volk of our own rank will be down here in their carriages
 as soon as' tis known.

" Now do n't you be bursting out
 angry!

which must be delivered, family or no

as the distance is so long

And you as well agreed as he, mother!"

" No," said the latter touchily,". 
---
for' ee to bide and
---
You see
---
I be not agreed I have been
 waiting while I go."

" I'll go."

, it would be no use."


---
This going
---
A sort of halo, an
 occidental glow, came over life then. 
---
Troubles and other realities
 took on themselves a metaphysical impalpability, and. 
---
which chafed body and soul
---
The youngsters,
 not immediately within sight, seemed rather bright and desirable
 appurtenances.

 without humorousness and jollity in their aspect there

 deputy- maternal attitude.

All these young souls were passengers in the Durbeyfield
 ship-- entirely dependent on the judgement of the two Durbeyfield
 adults for their pleasures, their necessities, their health, even
 their existence. 
---
If the heads of the Durbeyfield household chose

---
to sail into difficulty, disaster, starvation, disease, degradation,
 death, thither were these half- dozen little captives under hatches
. 
---
who had never
 been asked
---
if they wished for life on any terms, much less

if they
 wished for it on such hard conditions

Some people would like

not made for hasty
 progress; a street laid out before inches of land.

IV


 Rolliver's inn, the single alehouse at this end of the long and
 broken village, could only boast of an off- licence
---
; hence, as
 nobody could legally drink on the premises
---
, the amount of overt
 accommodation for consumers was strictly limited to a little board

---
about six inches wide and two yards long, fixed to the garden palings
 by pieces of wire
---
as they stood in the road and
---
they could have a restful seat inside
---
But there were also local customers who felt the
 same wish; and where there's a will.


---
there's a way
---
In a large bedroom upstairs, the window of which was,; all old inhabitants of the nearer
 end of Marlott, and frequenters of this retreat.
---
lately discarded by the
 landlady, Mrs Rolliver
---
the far more
 serious question, the quality of the liquor, confirmed the prevalent
 opinion that it was better to drink with Rolliver in a corner of the
 housetop than with the other landlord in a wide house.


---
which stood in the room
---
A gaunt four- post bedstead afforded
 sitting- space for several persons
---
;
 another rested on the oak- carved" cwoffer"; two on the wash- stand;
 another on the stool; and thus all were, somehow, seated at their
 ease. 
---
to which they had arrived at this
 hour
---
The stage of mental comfort was one wherein their souls expanded beyond their skins, and
 spread their personalities warmly through the room. 
---
In this process
 the chamber and its furniture grew more and more dignified and
 luxurious
---
the shawl hanging at the window
---
; took upon itself the
 richness of tapestry
---
; the brass handles of the chest of drawers were
 as golden knockers; and
---
the carved bedposts seemed.


---
which was
 in deep gloom
---
whose
 fingers knew the tricks of the latches well. 
---
as it rose into
 the light above the last stair
---
--Being a few private friends I've asked in to keep up club- walking
 at my own expense," the landlady exclaimed at the sound of footsteps,
 as glibly as a child repeating the Catechism,. 
---
how you frightened

---
" Oh,' tis you, Mrs Durbeyfield-- Lard-- me!--I thought."


---
it might be some gaffer sent by Gover'ment
---
any member of the Gover'ment should be passing, and
---
ee what's happened to us
---
there's any money hanging by it
---
" Ah, that's the secret
---
even if you do n't ride in' en
---
since you brought the news
---
-- what's that
---
That lady must be our relation
---
" And my projick is."


---
There IS a lady of the name
---
, now you mention it
---
" Pa'son Tringham did n't think of that. 
---
While this question was being discussed neither of the pair noticed,
 in their preoccupation
---
, that little Abraham had crept into the room,
 and.


---
' twill be a very good thing. 
---
why two branches o' one family should not be on visiting terms
---
" Yes; and we'll all claim kin!"
---
" And we'll all go and and
---
" How do you come here, child? 
---
ye talking
---
it brought out that
 very thing!... 
---
You should ha' seen
---
there is any such lady- relation
 yet
---
Though this conversation had been private, sufficient of
---
its import
 reached the understandings of those around.


---
that
 the Durbeyfields had weightier concerns to talk of now than common
 folks had, and
---
It was a local phrase which had a
 peculiar meaning, and
---
there was no reply.


---
The conversation became inclusive, and
---
presently other footsteps were
 heard.

"
---
The landlady had
---
hastily finish their ale, and
 Mrs Rolliver's caution following
 their footsteps
---
if ye'll be so good, my dears
---
They went home together,. 
---
as if they
 were marching to Bath--
---
which produced a comical effect, frequent
 enough in families on nocturnal homegoings;
---
and so they approached by degrees their own door
---
" Yours is not the
 only family that was of' count in wold days. 
---
though you was bigger folks than they, that's true
---
" Do n't you be so sure o' that. 
---
From you nater' tis my belief you've
 disgraced yourselves more than any o' us, and."


---
It was eleven o'clock
---
before the family were all in bed, and

---
two o'clock next morning was the latest hour for starting with
 the beehives. 
---
if they were, the way thither lying
 by bad roads over a distance of between twenty and thirty miles, and
 the horse and waggon being of the slowest
---
before the Saturday market began
---
But somebody must go
---
" It is late for the hives
 already. 
---
Swarming will soon be over for the year; and
---
it we put off
."


---
taking'em till next week's market the call for'em will be past, and

---
they'll be thrown on our hands
---
Some young feller,
 perhaps, would go? 
---
who were so much after dancing with
' ee yesterday
---
everybody know the reason
---
if Abraham could go with me
---
Little Abraham was

---
the twain, lighting
 a lantern, went out to the stable. 
---
The rickety little waggon was
 already laden, and
---
The poor creature looked wonderingly round at the night, at the
 lantern, at their two figures,. 
---
when every living thing was intended
---
They put a stock
 of candle- ends into the lantern,. 
---
as they
 could
---
To cheer themselves as well, they made an artificial morning with the lantern, some bread
 and butter, and their own conversation,. 
---
the real morning being far
 from come
---
assumed
 by the various dark objects against the sky
---
When they had passed the little town of Stourcastle
---
, dumbly somnolent
 under its thick brown thatch, they reached higher ground. 
---
Still
 higher, on their left, the elevation called Bulbarrow, or Bealbarrow,
 well- nigh the highest in South Wessex, swelled into the sky,
. 
---
engirdled by its earthen trenches
---
From hereabout the long road was
 fairly level for some distance onward. 
---
They mounted in front of the
 waggon, and
---
Abraham grew reflective.

" Tess!
---
" Bain't you glad?"


---
that we've become gentlefolk
---
But you be glad that you' m going to marry a gentleman?"


---
" That our great relation will help."


---
We have no such relation. 
---
What has put
 that into your head?"


---
'em talking about it up at Rolliver's
---
There's a rich lady of our family out at Trantridge, and

---
if you claimed kin with the lady
---
Abraham talked on, rather for the pleasure of utterance
 than for audition,. 
---
with upturned face
 made observations on the stars
---
, whose cold pulses were beating
 amid the black hollows above, in serene dissociation from these two
 wisps of human life. 
---
those twinklers were,
 and
---
whether God was on the other side of them
---
which seemed
---
" Did you say?"


---
the stars were worlds, Tess
---
They sometimes seem. 
---
" Which do we live on-- a splendid one or a blighted one?"

" A blighted one."


---
"' Tis very unlucky that we did n't pitch on a sound one, when there
 were so many more of' em!"


---
" Is it like that REALLY, Tess?
---
" said Abraham,. 
---
" How would
 it have been?"


---
if we had pitched on a sound one
---
" And you would have been a rich lady ready- made, and
---
Abraham to go to sleep
---
Prince required but slight attention,. 
---
the occasional heave of the wind became the sigh of some immense sad
 soul, conterminous with the universe in space, and with history in
 time.


---
Everything grew more and more extravagant, and
---
how
 time passed
---
followed by a shout of
" Hoi there
---
Something
 terrible had happened. 
---
The harness was entangled with an object
 which blocked the way.


---
as it always did
---
The pointed shaft of the cart had entered
 the breast of the unhappy Prince like a sword, and
---
that nothing more could be done immediately
---
which was
---
You was on the wrong side
---
you to do
---
so that the best thing for is
---
It is

---
you have nothing to fear.
---
The
 atmosphere turned pale
---
, the birds shook themselves in the hedges,

---
arose, and twittered; the lane showed all its white features, and

---
when the
 sun rose
---
a hundred prismatic hues were reflected from it. 
---
Prince lay
 alongside, still and stark
---
who had slept soundly
 through the whole disaster
---
We ca n't go on with our load
---
"-- Prince
 is killed!"


---
When Abraham realized all
---
, the furrows of fifty years were
.


---
' Tis because we be on a blighted star, and not a sound one
---
In silence they waited through an interval which seemed endless. 
---
At
 length a sound, and an approaching object, proved to them. 
---
the
 load taken on towards Casterbridge.


---
The evening of the same day saw the empty waggon reach again the
 spot of the accident. 
---
Prince had lain there in the ditch since the
 morning; but
---
the place of the blood- pool was still visible in the
 middle of the road,. 
---
that was left of Prince
---
How to break the news was. 
---
But the very shiftlessness of the household rendered. 
---
the misfortune
 a less terrifying one to them than it would have been to a thriving
 family,
---
though in the present case it meant ruin, and
---
in the other it
 would only have meant inconvenience
---
When it was discovered
---
When we
 d'Urbervilles was knights in the land
---
, we did n't sell our chargers
 for cat's meat. 
---
'em keep their shillings
---
When the hole was ready
---
Abraham and' Liza- Lu sobbed,
---
Hope and
 Modesty discharged their griefs in loud blares which echoed from the
 walls; and.

---
when Prince was tumbled
---
in they gathered
---
The bread- winner had been taken away from them
---
; what would they do?


---
the children cried
 anew. 
---
which had mainly depended on the horse

V


 The haggling business,, became
 disorganized forthwith. 
---
Distress, if not penury, loomed in the
 distance. 
---
what was locally called a slack- twisted
 fellow
---
the times could
 not be relied on; and,

---
when they did so coincide
---
We must take the ups wi' the downs, Tess
---
and never
 could your high blood have been found out at
---
You must try your friends. 
---
Do ye know'
---
who must
 be our relation
---
If there is such a lady
---
Besides, perhaps
 there's more in it than you know of.
---
" Durbeyfield, you can settle it
---
If you say."


---
you must leave it to me about asking for help.

---
And do n't go thinking about-- it is silly."


---
Who said?
---
it is in your mind, mother
---
which twice in the week ran from
 Shaston eastward to Chaseborough,
---
that had lost its
 original colour for a nondescript tertiary
---
which had little ladder- like holes
 at the knees
---
torn by kneeling in the roads and banks in search of
 vegetable and mineral treasures
---
how matters stood
---
In this instance it must be admitted.


---
that the Durbeyfields were

---
It was not a manorial home in the
 ordinary sense, with fields, and
---
pastures, and a grumbling farmer,
 out of whom the owner had. 
---
It was more, far more
---
what was required for residential
 purposes
---
kept in hand by the owner, and

---
tended by a bailiff
---
The crimson brick lodge came first in sight, up to its eaves in dense
 evergreens. 
---
this was the mansion itself till, and
---
at which the drive took a turn
---
onward to a point
, the house proper stood in full view.

---
It was of recent erection-- indeed almost new-- and of the same rich
 red colour that formed such a contrast with the evergreens of the
 lodge. 
---
which rose like a
 geranium bloom against the subdued colours around
---
wherein Druidical mistletoe was still found on aged oaks, and

---
where enormous yew- trees, grew
---
as
 they had grown
---
when they were pollarded for bows
---
All this sylvan
 antiquity, however, though visible from The Slopes, was outside the
 immediate boundaries of the estate.


---
Everything on this snug property was bright, thriving, and well kept
---
;
 acres of glass- houses stretched down the inclines to the copses at
 their feet. 
---
Everything looked like money-- like the last coin issued
 from the Mint. 
---
partly screened by Austrian pines
 and evergreen oaks, and fitted with every late appliance
---
The stables,, were
 as dignified as Chapels- of- Ease. 
---
On the extensive lawn stood an
 ornamental tent,.


---
we were an old family
---
this is all new
---
as they at first called
 themselves
---
who owned all this
---
The d'Urbervilles-- or Stoke- d'Urbervilles,--, were a somewhat unusual family to
 find in such an old- fashioned part of the country. 
---
Parson Tringham
 had spoken truly
---
our shambling
---
that the Stoke- d'Urbervilles were no more d'Urbervilles of
 the true tree
---
Yet it must be admitted.


---
that this
 family formed a very good stock whereon
---
which sadly
 wanted such renovation
---
( some said money- lender)
---
that would be less commonplace
 than the original bald, stark words
---
Conning for an hour in the
 British Museum the pages of works devoted to extinct, half- extinct,
 obscured, and
---
who supposed
 that
---
, a
 family name came by nature.


---
when a figure came
 forth from the dark triangular door of the tent
---
though red and smooth, above which was a well- groomed black moustache
 with curled points,
---
than the house and grounds had differed
---
It is n't business
---
"-- it is
---
" It is n't business-- it is-- I can hardly say what!"

 Why, sir, if I tell you, it will seem--"


---
" It is so very foolish
---
it would be like
 this
---
that we are of the same family as
 you
---
we have several proofs
 that we are d'Urbervilles. 
---
we are,--and-- and we
 have an old seal
---
And we have a very old silver spoon,. 
---
A castle argent is certainly my crest
---
we ought
---
ourselves beknown to you--
---
as
 we've lost our horse by a bad accident, and
---
" Well-- there's no harm in it. 
---
Where do you live? 
---
What are you?"


---
" It is a long while.

---
Supposing, my pretty Coz?
---
we walk round the grounds
---
when they come
---
" They are already here." 
---
They had spent,. 
---
then the two passed round to the
 rose- trees,.
---
Now, by the time you have had
 something to eat
---
, it will be time for you to leave,. 
---
if you want
---
It was evidently the gentleman's wish not
 to be disturbed in this pleasant_
---
Do you mind my smoking
---
it was this. 
---
that it was a fault
---
which
 time would cure
---
" And what do they call you?
---
till they were out of sight of the house
---
" And you say
---
your people have lost their horse?"


---
when they were in the turning of the
 drive, between the tall rhododendrons and conifers,
---
For a moment-- only for a moment-- before the lodge
 became visible
---
Thus the thing began. 
---
nearly as humanity can supply the right
 and desired
---
In the ill- judged execution of the well- judged plan of things the
 call seldom produces the comer
---
reply
" Here!" to a body's cry of" Where?" till the hide- and- seek has become
 an irksome, outworn game
---
We may wonder whether at the acme and
 summit of the human progress; but
---
these anachronisms will be corrected by
 a finer intuition, a closer interaction of the social machinery than
 that which now jolts us round and along
---
such completeness is not
. 
---
that in the
 present case, as in millions, it was not the two halves of a perfect
 whole that confronted each other at the perfect moment
---
Enough; a missing
 counterpart wandered independently about the earth. 
---
till the late time came
---
Out of which maladroit
 delay sprang anxieties, disappointments, shocks, catastrophes, and
 passing- strange destinies.


---
when they had started anew
---
than
 any had spoken before
---
:" Why, you be quite a posy! 
---
When the
 passengers were not looking
---
The van travelled only so far as Shaston, and there were several
 miles of pedestrian descent from that mountain- town into the vale to
 Marlott. 
---
they knew,
---
that something had occurred in the
 interim
---
ee it would be all right, and

---
now' tis proved
---
" So you've brought'em round!"


---
" How do you know, mother?"


---
that there would have been time for this
---
" They say--
---
ee as kin-- that's the meaning o't."


---
You zid somebody
---
who is apt
---
You've be'n born in the business, and
. 
---
They that be born in a business. 
---
Besides, that's only just a show of
 something for you to do,."


---
that you midn't feel beholden
---
" Who wrote the letter? 
---
Will you let?"


---
me look at it
---
Here it is."


---
The letter was in the third person, and.


---
that the wages would be on
 a liberal scale
---
" Oh-- that's all!"
---
" You could n't expect."


---
who had

---
the birds having proved untrustworthy
---
if you are at all
---
as you
 appear
---
you must be worth your weight in gold
---
" Well, there's your chance, whether or no; and
---
" Yes," said little Abraham, brightly, from the window- bench;" and
!
---
and it did twinkle. 
---
I seed it Mother, why did our grand relation keep on?"


---
my children going away from home
---
" I do n't quite like," said the
 haggler. 
---
" As the head of the family, the rest ought."


---
wi' her-- you can see that
---
" Well, perhaps that's
---
Well, what be you going?
---
you mid as well
---
" It is. 
---
for
 you to decide
---
which they imagined the other family
---
The children, to be)
 as a species of dolorifuge after the death of the horse, began, and.


---
they wailed, with square mouths. 
---
" And we sha n't have a
 nice new horse, and lots o' golden money to buy fairlings! 
---
than they were by
 prolonging them indefinitely
---
" That's right! 
---
it is a chance for earning money
---
It is no other kind of
 chance. 
---
You had
---
Thus it was arranged; and
---
that a
 spring- cart should be sent
---
" A cart?" murmured Joan Durbeyfield doubtingly. 
---
the fates seemed. 
---
when the grove is still
 mute,
---
who sings with a clear- voiced
 conviction
---
the rest
 preserving silence
---
" You will never set out?"


---
it will be wiser
 of' ee
---
you know best
---
what you like with me, mother
---
that when dried and brushed it looked twice as much as
 at other times
---
there's a hole in my stocking- heel
---
" Never mind holes in your stockings-- they do n't speak! 
---
the devil might ha' found me
 in heels."


---
" You must zee yourself!"
---
" It is much better than you was
 t'other day."


---
as it is the wo nt of bedecking cottagers to do
---
who was sitting in the lower
 room
---
whatever you do
---
If all goes well
---
when the
 first excitement of the dressing had passed off
---
It prompted the matron. 
---
sent by the Stoke- d'Urbervilles
---
Seeing, the younger children clamoured
.


---
Mother, how could you ever put such stuff into their heads?"


---
induced by a slight excess this morning in
 honour of the occasion
---
And tell'n, Tess, that being sunk,

---
Yes, twenty pound-- that's the lowest. 
---
Dammy, family
 honour is family honour,
---
who was about to do great things
---
flanked by innocence
---
They followed the way
---
till they reached the beginning of the ascent,
 on the crest of which the vehicle from Trantridge
---
,
 this limit having been fixed. 
---
Nobody was visible in the
 elevated road which skirted the ascent.


---
whom they had
 sent on before them
---
the cart will soon come, no doubt
---
It had come
---
They saw. 
---
another
 vehicle shot out from a clump of trees on the summit,.


---
who looked up as if in great surprise
---
that the second vehicle was
 not a humble conveyance like the first, but a spick- and- span gig or
 dog- cart, highly varnished and equipped
---
" Is dat the gentleman- kinsman who'll make Sissy a lady?
---
: it was
 misgiving. 
---
Something seemed
---
In a
 moment they had passed the slow cart with the box, and.


---
the interest of the matter as a
 drama was at an end
---
, the little ones' eyes filled with tears. 
---
The
 youngest child said,"!"
---
The
 new point of view was infectious, and
---
the next child did likewise,
 and.


---
then the next, till the whole three of them wailed loud
---
that perhaps
 it would ha' been better
---
" Ought n't ye to have thought of that before?"


---
if' twere the doing again
---
you mean?
---
as they
 went
---
Thus they
 reached the verge of an incline
---
down which the road stretched in a
 long straight descent of nearly a mile.


---
You will go down slow
---
There's nothing like it for raising your spirits."

"
---
But perhaps you need not now?
---
" there are two to be reckoned with
---
It is not me alone. 
---
Tib has, and
---
Did n't you notice it?"


---
if such has the power
---
" Why do you have such a horse?"


---
" Ah, well may you ask it! 
---
It was my fate
---
Tib has killed
 one chap; and
---
They were just beginning; and
---
it was evident.


---
, down, they sped
---
Down, the wheels humming like a top, the dog- cart
 rocking right and left
---
, its axis acquiring a slightly oblique set
 in relation to the line of progress; the figure of. 
---
the horse rising
 and
---
Sometimes a wheel was off
 the ground
---
, it seemed, for many yards
---
; sometimes a stone was sent
, and
---
flinty sparks from the horse's hoofs
 outshone the daylight. 
---
The aspect of the straight road enlarged with
 their advance, the two banks dividing like a splitting stick; one
 rushing past at each shoulder.


---
We shall be thrown out! 
---
if you do
---
so they reached the bottom.


---
" Well, you need not let so thanklessly the moment
 you feel yourself our of danger."


---
thus they reached the
 summit of another declivity.

"
---
when people find themselves on one of the highest points in the
 county
---
" But, they must get down again
---
away they went a second time. 
---
as they rocked
---
as you did before
---
me put one little kiss on those holmberry lips, Tess, or even on

---
that warmed cheek, and
---
Will nothing else do?
---
as they slowed
---
" Now, damn it-- I'll break both our necks!"
---
" So you can go from your word like that,
---
you
 young witch, can you?
---
since you be so determined
---
you would be kind to me, and, as my
 kinsman
---
" Kinsman be hanged! 
---
anybody to kiss me, sir
---
as they trotted on
 near Melbury Down and Wingreen,
---
that there was yet another descent to be undergone
---
" You shall be made sorry for that!"
---
Unless, that is,
 you agree willingly and no handkerchief.
---
me do it again,
---
me get my hat
---
You look prettier with it off
---
if that's possible
---
What's the matter?"


---
The hat was in place and, but
---
" What-- you wo n't get up beside me?"


---
Besides, the cart is behind."


---
didn't you make
---
that hat blow off
 on purpose
---
you did
---
You ought!
---
there be
 peace
---
in this manner, at
 a slow pace, they advanced towards the village of Trantridge. 
---
whether it would be wiser

---
it seemed
 unless for graver
 reasons. 
---
The community of fowls made its
 headquarters in an old thatched cottage standing in an enclosure that
 had once been a garden, but.

---
The house was overrun with ivy
---
, its chimney being enlarged by the
 boughs of the parasite to the aspect of a ruined tower. 
---
The lower
 rooms were entirely given over to the birds, who walked about them
 with a proprietary air, as though the place had been built by
 themselves, and not by certain dusty copyholders who now lay east
 and west in the churchyard. 
---
The descendants of these bygone owners
 felt it almost as a slight to their family. 
---
which had
 so much of their affection
---
when the house, had cost so much of their forefathers'
 money, and
---
before the d'Urbervilles came and
---
"' Twas good enough for
 Christians in grandfather's time," they said.


---
The rooms wherein dozens of infants had wailed at their nursing now
. 
---
Distracted hens in
 coops occupied spots. 
---
The chimney- corner and once- blazing hearth was
---
in which the hens laid their eggs
---
while out of doors the plots that each succeeding householder had

---
were torn by the cocks in wildest
 fashion
---
in which the cottage stood
---
The garden was surrounded by a wall, and
.


---
as the daughter of a professed poulterer, the door in the wall
 opened and
---
a servant in white cap and apron entered
---
Mis'ess is a old
 lady, and blind
---
who had likewise taken two
---
that some occupant of its chambers could bend to the love of
 dumb creatures-- feathers floating within view of the front, and
 hen- coops standing on the grass
---
Ah, you are?"
---
you will be kind
 to them
---
My bailiff tells me.

---
you are quite the proper person
---
Well, where are they? 
---
Ah, this is Strut! 
---
And Phena too-- yes, they are a little frightened-- aren't
 you, dears?
---
But they will soon get."


---
if a single feather were crippled or draggled
---
what they had eaten
---
The birds were duly returned to the
 yard, and
---
the process was repeated.


---
, the fowls the young people presented, and.

---
Can you whistle
---
that such was the fact
---
" Then you will have. 
---
you to whistle to my bullfinches
---
we teach. 
---
'em airs
 that way
---
You must begin
 to- morrow, or
---
they will go back in their piping.
---
They have been
 neglected these several days."


---
The old lady's face creased into furrows of repugnance, and
---
the birds were taken back to their quarters. 
---
Why,
 you are quite cross."


---
because you ca n't do it
---
why you are trying-- those bullies
---
you to carry on their musical education
---
me particularly to do it, and
---
" Oh no, you wo n't!
---
See-- I'll stand on this side
 of the wire- netting, and
---
you can keep on the other;. 
---
so you may feel
 quite safe
---
Now, look here; you screw up your lips too harshly.

---
" That's it! 
---
-- you'll go on beautifully
---
you learn
---
you will be
 quite in favour. 
---
If
 you meet with any difficulties and
---
It was in the economy of this_ régime_. 
---
which could engender shyness of kind
---
the bullfinches occupied the same apartment,
, and. 
---
where they flitted about freely at certain hours
---
The old lady was
 not present, and
---
Every village has its idiosyncrasy, its constitution, often its own
 code of morality. 
---
who ruled The Slopes in that vicinity
---
The place had
 also a more abiding defect
---
; it drank hard. 
---
The staple conversation
 on the farms around was on the uselessness of saving money; and

---
smock- frocked arithmeticians, leaning on their ploughs or hoes, would
 enter into calculations of great nicety.


---
when work was done
---
sold to them as beer by the monopolizers of the
 once- independent inns
---
This had gone on for a month or two on which a fair and a market coincided; and the pilgrims
 from Trantridge sought double delights at the inns on that account.

---
when there came a Saturday in
 September,
---
It was a fine September evening,
 just before sunset,, and
---
when yellow lights struggle with blue shades in
 hairlike lines
---
the atmosphere itself forms a prospect without
 aid from more solid objects, except the innumerable winged insects
 that dance in it. 
---
that most of
 them had gone to what they called a private little jig at the house
 of a hay- trusser and peat- dealer who had transactions with their
 farm
---
no sound of
 dancing was audible-- an exceptional state of things for these parts,
. 
---
where as a rule the stamping drowned the music
---
It was a windowless erection used for storage, and. 
---
that it was a cloud of dust, lit by candles within the
 outhouse
---
, whose beams upon the haze carried forward the outline of
 the doorway into the wide night of the garden.


---
Through this floating, fusty
_ debris_ of peat and hay, mixed with the perspirations and warmth of
 the dancers, and forming together a sort of vegeto- human pollen, the
 muted fiddles feebly pushed their notes, in marked contrast to the
 spirit with which the measure was trodden out. 
---
They coughed, and. 
---
as
 they danced
---
as they coughed
---
Of the rushing couples
 there could barely be discerned more than the high lights--.


---
the
 indistinctness shaping them to satyrs--
---
a multiplicity
 of Pans whirling a multiplicity of Syrinxes
---
; Lotis attempting, and
---
At intervals a couple would approach the doorway for air, and
. 
---
Could Trantridge in two or three short hours have
 metamorphosed itself thus madly!


---
Some Sileni of the throng sat on benches and hay- trusses by the wall;
 and.


---
" The maids do n't think it respectable to dance at The Flower- de- Luce,"

---
" They do n't like. 
---
everybody see
---
Besides, the house sometimes shuts up. 
---
just when their
 jints begin
---
So we come here and."


---
" But when be any of you going home?"
---
This is all but the last jig."


---
The reel drew to a close, and
---
some of the party were in
 the mind of starting. 
---
But others would not, and
---
another dance was

---
This surely would end it. 
---
But it merged in
 yet another. 
---
, it was necessary
---
having waited so
 long to wait longer; on account of the fair the
 roads were dotted with roving characters of possibly ill intent; and,
 though not fearful of measurable dangers
---
" Do n't ye be nervous, my dear good soul
---
that the brim encircled it like the nimbus of a saint
---
" What's yer hurry? 
---
we can sleep
 it off in church- time. 
---
The
 movement grew more passionate:
---
the fiddlers behind the luminous
 pillar of cloud now and then varied the air by playing on the wrong
 side of the bridge or with the back of the bow. 
---
But it did not
 matter; the panting shapes spun onwards.


---
They did not vary their partners. 
---
if their inclination were
---
Changing partners simply meant. 
---
that a satisfactory
 choice had not as yet been arrived at by one or other of the pair,
 and
---
by this time every couple had been suitably matched
---
It was then

---
that the ecstasy and the dream began,
---
in which emotion was the matter
 of the universe, and matter but an adventitious intrusion likely to
 hinder you from spinning where you wanted to spin.


---
Suddenly there was a dull thump on the ground:
---
a couple had fallen,
 and. 
---
The next couple, unable to check its
 progress, came. 
---
An inner cloud of dust
 rose around the prostrate figures amid the general one of the room,

---
in which a twitching entanglement of arms and legs was discernible.


---
You shall catch it for this, my gentleman,!"
---
when you get home
---
whose clumsiness had caused the mishap
---
in which assortment there was
 nothing unusual at Trantridge as long as any affection remained
 between wedded couples; and, indeed
---
, it was not uncustomary in their
 later lives,
---
to avoid making odd lots of the single people between
 whom there might be a warm understanding.


---
" Well, my Beauty, what are you doing here?"


---
" But it seems
---
they will never leave off,
---
they will expect me to now
---
they are having there
---
the Trantridge people began
---
who had come in from other farms
---
Their bundles and baskets were gathered
 up, and.


---
when the clock- chime sounded a quarter
 past eleven
---
half an hour later,, they were straggling along the lane which led up the
 hill towards their homes
---
It was a three- mile walk, along a dry white road,.


---
made whiter
 to- night by the light of the moon
---
Yet however terrestrial and lumpy their appearance
 just now to the mean unglamoured eye, to themselves the case was
 different. 
---
They followed the road with a sensation. 
---
that they were

---
all the parts harmoniously and joyously
 interpenetrated each other
---
They were as sublime as the moon and
 stars above them, and the moon and stars were as ardent as they.


---
that the discovery of their condition spoilt the
 pleasure
---
In the open highway they had progressed in scattered order; but
---
now
 their route was through a field- gate, and.


---
the foremost finding a
 difficulty in opening it, they closed up together
---
The basket being
---
" Well-- whatever is.


---
All looked at Car. 
---
it glistened like a slimy snake in the cold
 still rays of the moon.


---
"' Tis treacle," said an observant matron.


---
Treacle it was. 
---
Car's poor old grandmother had a weakness for the
 sweet stuff. 
---
treacle was, and
---
Car had been about to give her
 a treat of surprise. 
---
that the vessel containing the syrup had been smashed within
---
which irritated the dark
 queen into getting rid of the disfigurement by the first sudden means
 available
---
they were about to cross, and
---
The laughter rang louder
---
; they clung to the gate, to the posts,
. 
---
engendered by their
 convulsions at the spectacle of Car
---
who had
---
It was a misfortune-- in more ways than one. 
---
How darest th' laugh at me, hussy!
---
when t'others did
---
my lady, stop a
 bit
---
you was of that sort
---
as this is
---
who having stood in the
 relations to d'Urberville that Car had also been suspected of, united
 with the latter against the common enemy
---
for the rollicking evening they had passed
---
Thereupon, finding, the husbands and lovers
 tried; but
---
the result of that attempt
 was directly.


---
well enough
 that the better among them would repent of their passion next day
---
They were all now inside the field, and
---
What the devil is all this row about, work- folk
---
The explanation was not readily forthcoming; and, in truth
---
we'll get shot
 of the screaming cats in a jiffy!"


---
such
 proffered aid and company,; and
---
now the loneliness would not of itself have forced. 
---
as the invitation did at the particular
 juncture
---
when fear and indignation at these adversaries could be
 transformed by a spring of the foot into a triumph over them
---
The pair were
 speeding away into the distant gray by the time that the contentious
 revellers became aware of what had happened.


---
a gaze of fixity in the direction in which the
 horse's tramp was diminishing into silence on the road
---
What be ye looking at?
---
who had not observed the
 incident
---
" Ho- ho- ho!" laughed dark Car.


---
" Hee- hee- hee!" laughed the tippling bride,.


---
Then these children of the open air, whom even excess of alcohol
 could scarce injure permanently,;
 and
---
as they went there
---
formed by the moon's
 rays upon the glistening sheet of dew
---
; till the erratic motions seemed an
 inherent part of the irradiation, and the fumes of their breathing
 a component of the night's mist; and the spirit of the scene, and
 of the moonlight, and of Nature,
---
The twain cantered along for some time without speech, Tess. 
---
Neatly done
---
, was it not, dear Tess
---
" And are you?"


---
" Tess, why do you always dislike my kissing you?"


---
" You are quite sure?"


---
that anything was better then frigidity
---
" Why haven't you told me?"


---
" You know very well why. 
---
You have sometimes.
---
" You know as well
---
the horse ambled along for a considerable
 distance, till a faint luminous fog, which had hung in the hollows
 all the evening,
---
It seemed. 
---
, it was now
 nearly one o'clock. 
---
That is devilish unkind
---
that this might after all
 be true
---
unless you show some confidence in me
---
to be repulsed so by a mere chit like
 you
---
For near three mortal months have you trifled with my feelings"


---
" No, you will not leave me to- morrow! 
---
Will you, I ask once more,
? 
---
me clasp you with my arm
---
We know each other well; and

---
you know. 
---
which you are
---
Thus they sidled
 slowly onward.


---
they had been advancing for an
 unconscionable time-- far longer
---
than was usually occupied by the
 short journey from Chaseborough, even at this walking pace, and

---
that they were no longer on hard road, but in a mere trackway
---
" Why, where be we?
---
Surely we are quite out of the road?"


---
It is a lovely
 night, and
---
why should we not prolong our ride a little?"


---
How could you be so treacherous!
---
me walk home
---
" You can not walk home, darling,. 
---
even if the air were clear
---
We are
 miles away from Trantridge,."


---
in this growing
 fog you might wander for hours among these trees
---
where it is
---
me get down,
---
you may
---
whatever yourself feel about it
---
As to your getting to Trantridge without assistance, it is quite
 impossible
---
which so
 disguises everything
---
where we are myself
---
if you will promise
---
if you insist upon walking you may; or
 you may ride-- at your pleasure
---
" Oh no; it's not necessary
---
Now, you sit there
---
" The leaves have not got as yet.

---
-- it will be quite sufficient."


---
" O how very good of you that is!
---
" And the children have some toys."


---
"-- you ever sent them anything!"
---
you had not-- yes, I almost wish it
---
" It-- hampers me so."


---
" Tessy-- don't you love me ever so little now?"


---
Are you cold
---
" You have only that puffy muslin dress on--
---
how's that?"


---
" It's my best summer one. '
---
that it would be night
---
" Nights grow chilly in September. 
---
me see
---
That's it
---
-- now you'll feel warmer
---
With the setting of the moon the
 pale light lessened, and
---
they were in
---
that came to hand
---
which settled the question of their
 whereabouts
---
by this time
 the moon had quite gone down, and partly on account of the fog
---
The
 Chase was wrapped in thick darkness,
---
There was no answer. 
---
Everything else was blackness alike. 
---
Darkness and silence ruled everywhere around. 
---
the
 primeval yews and oaks of The Chase, in which there poised gentle
 roosting birds in their last nap; and
---
But, might some say,?
---
Perhaps, like
 that other god of whom the ironical Tishbite spoke.


---
Why it was
---
that upon this beautiful feminine tissue, sensitive as
 gossamer, and practically blank as snow as yet, there should have

---
as it was doomed
---
been traced such a coarse pattern to receive; why
 so often the coarse appropriates the finer thus
---
One may,
 indeed, admit the possibility of a retribution lurking in the present
 catastrophe. 
---
But though to visit
 the sins of the fathers upon the children may be a morality good
 enough for divinities, it is scorned by average human nature; and
---
it
 therefore does not mend the matter.


---
:" It was." 
---
An immeasurable social chasm was.

THE FIRST





 Phase the Second: Maiden

No More



 XII


 The basket was heavy and
---
the bundle was large, but
---
The time was not long past daybreak,
 and
---
The ascent was gradual on this
 side, and
---
the soil and scenery differed much from those within
 Blakemore Vale. 
---
Even the character and accent of the two peoples
 had shades of difference, despite the amalgamating effects of a
 roundabout railway
---
The field- folk shut in there traded northward and

---
westward, travelled, courted, and.


---
those on this side mainly directed
 their energies and attention to the east and south
---
The incline was the same down. 
---
It
 was always beautiful from here
---
where the sweet birds sing
---
bowed by thought
---
who,,
 stood still here, and
---
" Why did you slip away by stealth like this?"
---
when people
 were all in bed
---
You know.

---
that nobody wished
---
And how unnecessary it has been! 
---
for you to toil along on foot, and

---
if you wo n't
 come back
---
me help you on
---
they sat side by side. 
---
the journey was continued
 with broken unemotional conversation on the commonplace objects by
 the wayside. 
---
, they had driven in the opposite direction along
 the same road
---
After some miles they came
 in view of the clump of trees beyond which the village of Marlott
 stood. 
---
It was only then.


---
" What are you crying for
---
Well-- we must all be born somewhere."


---
if you did n't wish
---
Well, to come to Trantridge why did you
 come?"


---
" You did n't come for love of me,."


---
My eyes were for a little, and
---
dazed by
 you
---
that was all."


---
till it was too late
---
" That's."


---
" How can you dare!"
---
Did it never strike your mind?"


---
" Only you need n't be
---
You know. 
---
you
 need not work in the fields or the dairies again
---
You know
---
you may
 clothe yourself with the best, instead of in the bald plain way you
 have lately affected, as if you could n't get a ribbon more than you
 earn."


---
though there was little scorn,
---
you were a princess from your manner
---
if certain circumstances should arise
---
And-- you
 understand--
---
in which you are in the least need
---
, the least difficulty,
 send me one line, and
---
you shall have by return.

---
whatever you require
---
But all letters will be forwarded.
---
they
 stopped just under the clump of trees. 
---
" You are not going
---
If you wish
---
how you've mastered
 me
---
while the kiss was

---
" You do n't give me your mouth and. 
---
You never willingly
 do that--
---
It is true. 
---
Perhaps,
 of all things, a lie on this thing would do the most good to me now.

---
enough left
---
you know
 it
---
" Well, you are absurdly melancholy, Tess. 
---
that you need not be so sad
---
If you are wise
---
you will show it to the
 world more than you do... 
---
before it fades
---
you go like this
---
It was still early, and
---
though the sun's lower limb was just free of
 the hill
---
There was not a human soul near. 
---
the only two existences haunting that
 lane
---
It is early to be astir this Sabbath morn
---
When most people are at rest from their week's work."


---
"."

" Do you?"


---
That's more real than the other-- hey? 
---
If you'll wait a
 moment
---
that was in it
---
stirring
 the paint with the brush began
---
while that word was

---
Against the peaceful landscape, the pale, decaying tints of the
 copses, the blue air of the horizon, and the lichened stile- boards,
 these staring vermilion words shone forth. 
---
They seemed. 
---
Some people might have
 cried"
---
which had served mankind well in its time
---
It was; yet
---
Do you believe?
---
what you paint
---
your sin was not of your own

---
they are horrible
---
" That's!"
---
what they are meant
---
" But you should read my hottest ones-- them. 
---
They'd make! 
---
ye wriggle
---
Not but what this is a very good
 tex for rural districts.
---
...  Ah-- there's a nice bit of blank wall up
 by that barn. 
---
Will
 ye wait, missy?"


---
The old gray wall began. 
---
it had never before been called upon

---
If you want
---
God said such things
---
The aspect of the interior,, made. 
---
who had just
 come down stairs
---
The young
 children were still above,.


---
it being Sunday
 morning,
---
" How be ye? 
---
till you was in upon
 me
---
I did n't see you!  Have you come home?"


---
" What, is n't?"


---
your cousin going
---
" Come, you have not told me all
---
And yet th'st not got!"
---
" It would have been something like a story to come back with, if
 you had!". 
---
which has reached
 us here
---
" After all the talk about you and him, who would have expected! 
---
it to end like this
---
Why did n't ye
 think of doing some good for your family instead o? 
---
what a pretty pair you and he
 made that day
---
when you drove away together four months ago
---
as we thought
---
Perhaps it was unusual
 in the circumstances, unlucky, unaccountable; but
---
there it was; and
 this,,. 
---
That was all. 
---
" You ought!
---
if you did n't mean
---
Why did n't you tell me? 
---
there was danger in men- folk
---
Why
 did n't you warn me? 
---
Ladies know,; but
---
because
 they read novels that tell them of these tricks
---
you did not help me!"


---
what they might lead
 to
---
Well, we must make the best of it
---
if rumour be not too large a word for
 a space of a square mile
---
who had made a transcendent conquest( as
 they supposed
---
that it was
---
For the fact this said.


---
thirty- first cousin,
 Mr d'Urberville,, a gentleman
 not altogether local, whose reputation as a reckless gallant and
 heartbreaker was beginning
---
that it would have exercised if unhazardous
---
it cost an immense deal, and
---
who was reaching
---
as well as it could
---
; it might end in marriage yet, and

---
as the evening wore on
---
that the illusion was transient as lightning
---
;
 cold reason came back
---
when it was no longer
 Sunday
---
And the despondency of the next morning's dawn,, but Monday; and no best clothes; and the laughing visitors
 were gone, and
---
it had inspired
---
such as it was
---
the old Psalms,
 and to join in the Morning Hymn
---
before
 the chiming began
---
where the bier
 stood on end among the churchyard tools
---
Parishioners dropped in by twos and threes,
---
as if they were praying
---
though they were not
---
When the chants came on,
---
what it was called
---
the
 thought, how strange and god- like was a composer's power, who from
 the grave could lead through sequences of emotion,
---
who had turned their heads
---
The people turned them again; and
---
as the
 service proceeded
---
what their whispers were about
---
that at length
 almost everybody thought
---
The only exercise was after dark; and
---
it
 was then,. 
---
when the
 light and the darkness are so evenly balanced that the constraint of
 day and the suspense of night neutralize each other
---
It is then. 
---
that the plight of being alive becomes
 attenuated to its least possible dimensions
---
rather that
 cold accretion called the world
---
Rather they became a part of it;
---
what they seemed
---
they were
---
The
 midnight airs and gusts, moaning amongst the tightly- wrapped buds and
 bark of the winter twigs, were formulae of bitter reproach. 
---
It was. 
---
they
 that were out of harmony with the actual world, not she
---
It was a hazy sunrise in August. 
---
attacked by the warm beams
---
The denser nocturnal vapours,
, were dividing and.


---
where they waited
---
till they
 should be dried away to nothing
---
The sun, on account of the mist, had a curious sentient, personal
 look,.

---
One could
 feel. 
---
that a saner religion had never prevailed under the sky
---
The
 luminary was a golden- haired, beaming, mild- eyed, God- like creature,
.


---
that morning
---
But of all ruddy things the brightest were two broad
 arms of painted wood, which rose from the margin of yellow cornfield
 hard by Marlott village. 
---
They, with two others below, formed the
 revolving Maltese cross of the reaping- machine, which had been
 brought to the field on the previous evening. 
---
with which they were smeared,
,
---
intensified in hue by the sunlight
---
The paint imparted to them a look of
.


---
The field had already been" opened"
---
that is
---
; to say, a lane a few
 feet wide had been hand- cut through the wheat along the whole
 circumference of the field for the first passage of the horses and
 machine.


---
when the shadows of the eastern hedge- top
 struck the west hedge midway
---
that the heads of the groups were

---
while their feet were still in the dawn
---
They
 disappeared from the lane between the two stone posts which flanked
 the nearest field- gate.


---
The machine had begun, and
---
a moving concatenation
 of three horses and the aforesaid long rickety machine was visible
 over the gate, a driver sitting  upon one of the hauling horses,
 and an attendant on the seat of the implement. 
---
Along one side of
 the field the whole wain went, the arms of the mechanical reaper
 revolving slowly, till it passed down the hill quite out of sight.

---
In a minute it came up on the other side of the field at the same
 equable pace.


---
; the glistening brass star in the forehead of the fore
 horse first catching the eye,
 then the bright arms, and then the whole machine
---
as it rose into view over the stubble
---
The narrow lane of stubble encompassing the field grew wider with
 each circuit, and
---
the standing corn was reduced to a smaller area. 
---
as
 the morning wore on
---
Rabbits, hares, snakes, rats, mice, retreated
 inwards as into a fastness, unaware of the ephemeral nature of their
 refuge, and
---
that awaited them later in the day
---
of the doom when,
 their covert shrinking to a more and more horrible narrowness, they
 were huddled together, friends and foes, till the last few yards of
 upright wheat
---
they were every one put to death by the sticks and stones of the
 harvesters.


---
The reaping- machine left the fallen corn behind it in little heaps,
; and upon these the
 active binders in the rear but
---
each heap being of the quantity for a sheaf
---
which twinkled and
---
for they were mostly young
---
being wounded by the stubble
---
Perhaps one reason is.


---
then when lifted by the
 breeze
---
as the day wears on
 its feminine smoothness
---
The cheeks are paler, the teeth more regular,
 the red lips thinner.


---
It is
---
nothing being so remunerative for the time as
 harvesting in the fields
---
the whole bevy of them drawing together like dancers in a quadrille
 at the completion of a sheaf by each,
---
as it was

---
ten or a dozen was formed
---
They went to breakfast, and. 
---
the work proceeded as
 before
---
On the verge of the hour the heads of a group of children, of ages
 ranging from six to fourteen, rose over the stubbly convexity of the
 hill.


---
who wore a triangular shawl
---
its
 corner draggling on the stubble
---
Another brought some lunch. 
---
The harvesters ceased,
. 
---
Here
 they fell to.


---
who,
 glad to be relieved of the burden, went away to the next shock and

---
who sat nearest considerately
---
some of them beginning
---
that would no
 longer yield a stream
---
When the infant had taken its fill
---
that was almost dislike
---
Lord,
' tis wonderful what a body can get used to o' that sort in time!"


---
There were they; and
---
if folks had

---
" A little more than persuading had to do wi' the coming o't, I
 reckon.  The plain ones be as safe as churches-- hey, Jenny?" 
---
The
 speaker turned to one of the group who certainly was not ill- defined
 as plain.


---
It was a thousand pities, indeed
---
; it was impossible for even an enemy
, neither black nor blue nor
 grey nor violet
---
which could be seen
---
if one looked into their irises
---
that had no bottom
---
that lonely inexperience could devise
---
The past was past;
---
whatever
 it had been
---
, it was no more at hand. 
---
Whatever its consequences,
 time would close over them; they would all in a few years, and
---
as if
 they had never been
---
Meanwhile the trees were just as green as before
---
; the birds sang and

---
the sun shone as clearly now as ever. 
---
The familiar surroundings had
.


---
it was only this much to
 them--"Ah." 
---
harvest- hands being greatly in demand just then
---
This was
.


---
which had been
 unharnessed and fed
---
The horses,, were again attached to the scarlet machine.

---
In the afternoon and evening the proceedings of the morning were
.

---
Then they all rode home in one of the largest wagons, in the company
 of a broad tarnished moon that had risen from the ground to the
 eastwards, its face resembling the outworn gold- leaf halo of some
 worm- eaten Tuscan saint. 
---
There are counterpoises
 and compensations in life; and
---
, their lively spirits were contagious, and

---
which knew no social law
---
it was
---
that the baby had been
---
Some such collapse had been probable,
; but
---
the event came as a shock
 nevertheless.


---
The baby's offence against society in coming into the world was

---
However, it soon grew
 clear.

---
that the hour of emancipation for that little prisoner of the
 flesh was
---
the inferences
 to be drawn therefrom
---
when the same question arose with regard
 to the baby
---
But, it had a very different colour. 
---
It was nearly bedtime, but
---
The moment happened. 
---
The household went to bed, and, distressed beyond measure,. 
---
that the baby was still worse
---
It was
 but none the less surely.


---
The clock struck the
 solemn hour of one, that hour when fancy stalks outside reason, and

---
malignant possibilities stand rock- firm as facts. 
---
they used for
 heating the oven on baking days;
---
many
 other quaint and curious details of torment sometimes taught the
 young in this Christian country. 
---
The infant's breathing grew more difficult, and
---
It was useless
---
as you want to upon me, and
---
Ah! perhaps baby can be saved! 
---
Perhaps it will be just the same!"


---
all of whom occupied the same room. 
---
them kneel around,
---
as the clerk at church
 held it before the parson; and
---
which sunlight might have revealed
---
which was almost regal
---
The little ones kneeling round, their sleepy
 eyes blinking and red
---
which their physical heaviness at that hour would not allow
---
The most impressed of them said:

"?"


---
Be you really going, Tess
---
suggested by a phrase in
 the book of Genesis
---
there was silence.


---
" We receive this child"--and
---
, they again piped
 into silence," Amen!"


---
with whom they had nothing in common
---
the devil was

---
Poor Sorrow's campaign against sin, the world, and doomed. 
---
when the other children
 awoke
---
they cried bitterly, and.


---
who respects not the social law
---
to whom eternal Time had been a matter of days merely,
---
who
 knew not
---
that such things as years and centuries ever were
---
that
 bastard gift of shameless Nature,;
 a waif; to whom
 the cottage interior was the universe, the week's weather climate,
 new- born babyhood human existence, and the instinct to suck human
 knowledge
---
who mused on the christening a good deal
---
if it were
 doctrinally sufficient to secure a Christian burial for the child
---
Nobody could tell this but the parson of the parish, and
---
The
 enterprise would have been abandoned. 
---
had not by accident
---
can you tell me this--
---
" Then will you give him a Christian burial?
---
The Vicar felt.
---
-- that's another matter
---
if only we two were concerned
---
if you do n't
---
Will it
 be just the same? 
---
it is beyond a layman's
 power
---
also--

" It will be just the same
---
buried by lantern- light
---
the nettles grow
---
where all unbaptized infants, notorious drunkards, suicides,
 and others of the conjecturally damned are laid
---
What matter was it? 
---
that on the outside of the jar the eye of
 mere observation noted the words" Keelwell's Marmalade"
---
The eye of
 maternal affection did not see them in its vision of higher things.




---
," says Roger Ascham
---
" By experience," we find out a short way by
 a long wandering." 
---
of what use is our experience to us then? 
---
who would now accept?


---
is it in anybody's power--. 
---
while it is possible
---
Thou hast counselled a better course
 than Thou hast permitted
---
as they came past in the revolution
 of the year
---
every other day individualized
 by incidents
---
When was it? 
---
Jeremy Taylor's
 thought. 
---
that some time in the future those would
 say:"
---
there would be nothing singular to their minds in the statement
---
what would have been called a fine creature
---
whom the turbulent
 experiences of the last year or two had quite failed
---
But for the world's opinion those experiences would have been simply
 a liberal education.


---
To escape the past and all that
 appertained thereto was.


---
which pervaded organic nature
---
The
 recuperative power was surely
---
A particularly fine spring came round, and
---
the stir of
 germination was almost audible in the buds
---
as it moved
 the wild animals
---
that a skilful milkmaid was required at a dairy- house
 many miles to the southward, and
---
It was not quite so far off as could have been wished; but
---
it was
 probably far enough
---
To persons of limited spheres, miles are as geographical
 degrees, parishes as counties, counties as provinces and kingdoms.


---
though no words had passed between them on the
 subject
---
Yet such is human inconsistency). 
---
that the individual innocence of a humble descendant could lapse
 as silently
---
It was unexpected
 youth, and the invincible instinct towards self- delight.



---
THE SECOND





 Phase the Third
---
which engirdled this interior tract of
 country
---
in which the dairy stood
---
that had been theirs
---
; not a thing of all did
 but the old seal and spoon. "
---
It was
 two hours,
---
so well watered by the river Var or Froom
---
The world was drawn
 to a larger pattern here. 
---
The enclosures numbered fifty acres
 instead of ten
---
, the farmsteads were more extended, the groups of
 cattle formed tribes hereabout; there only families. 
---
The green
 lea was speckled as thickly with them as a canvas by Van Alsloot
 or Sallaert with burghers. 
---
It lacked the intensely blue atmosphere of the
 rival vale, and its heavy soils and scents
---
; the new air was clear,
. 
---
which nourished the grass
 and cows of these renowned dairies
---
The river itself,, flowed not like the streams in
 Blackmoor. 
---
Those were slow, silent,;. 
---
into which the incautious wader might sink and
---
The Froom waters were clear. 
---
There the
 water- flower was the lily; the crow- foot here.


---
as
 the thoughts were gay or grave
---
which pervades all life
---
The irresistible, universal, automatic tendency to find sweet
 pleasure somewhere,, from the meanest to the
 highest, had at length. 
---
who mentally and sentimentally had not finished

---
Being even now only a young
 woman of twenty, one growing, it was impossible.


---
And probably the half- unconscious rhapsody was a Fetishistic
 utterance in a Monotheistic setting
---
it was enough.

---
Such high contentment with such a slight initial performance as that
 of having started towards a means of independent living was a part of
 the Durbeyfield temperament. 
---
could alone be effected by a family
---
as the
 once powerful d'Urbervilles were now
---
There was.
---
, it might be said,
---
the truth be told
---
While there's life
---
there's hope.


---
as some amiable theorists would
 have
---
us believe
---
The marked difference, in the final particular, between the rival
 vales now showed itself. 
---
The secret of Blackmoor was
---
which
 stretched to the east and west as far as the eye could reach
---
The river had stolen from the higher tracts and
---
Suddenly there arose from all parts of the lowland a prolonged and
 repeated call--"Waow!
---
From the furthest east to the furthest west the cries spread. 
---
as if by
 contagion, accompanied in some cases by the barking of a dog
---
which had been phlegmatically

---
The red and white herd nearest at hand, waiting for the call, now trooped towards the steading in the
 background,. 
---
their great bags of milk swinging under them
---
as they
 walked
---
Long
 thatched sheds stretched round the enclosure,. 
---
their slopes encrusted
 with vivid green moss, and
---
their eaves supported by wooden posts

---
of which a switch moved pendulum- wise;,
---
while the sun, lowering itself
 behind this patient row
---
Thus it threw shadows of these_
---
if it had been
 the profile of a court beauty on a palace wall
---
as it had copied Olympian shapes on marble
---
They were the less restful cows that were stalled. 
---
that would
 stand still of their own will
---
Those were milked in the middle of the yard,
. 
---
where many of such better behaved ones stood-- all prime
 milchers, such as
---
; nourished by the succulent feed which the water- meads
 supplied at this prime season of the year
---
that were
 spotted with white
---
Those of them reflected the sunshine in dazzling brilliancy,
 and the polished brass knobs of their horns. 
---
Their large- veined udders hung ponderous as
 sandbags,;
 and.




---
the teats sticking out like the legs of a gipsy's crock
---
The dairymaids and men had flocked down from their cottages and out
 of the dairy- house with the arrival of the cows from the meads
---
; the
 maids walking in pattens, not on account of the weather, but. 
---
The male milkers, with hat- brims turned down,

---
The majority of dairymen have a cross manner at milking time, but and
---
it
 happened
---
that Mr Crick was glad to get a new hand-- for the days
---
that use
---
that a family of some such name as yours in Blackmoor
 Vale came originally from these parts, and
---
that had
---
that' twere a old ancient
 race all but perished off the earth--
---
though the new
 generations did n't know it
---
" Oh no-- it is nothing
---
Then the talk was of business only.


---
" You can milk'em clean, my maidy?
---
my cows going azew at
 this time o' year
---
you can stand it
---
we do n't live in a cowcumber frame
---
you'll want a dish o' tay, or victuals of some sort,
 hey? 
---
as ye like about it
---
whose mind
 it had apparently never occurred.


---
that milk was good as a beverage
---
if ye can swaller
---
" Oh, that, be it so
---
touched for years-- not I.  Rot the stuff
---
"' Tis; it would lie in my innerds
 like lead. 
---
we've easy ones, like other folks. 
---
However, you'll find out
 that soon enough."


---
The conviction bred serenity
---
It was a large dairy. 
---
There were nearly a hundred
 milchers under Crick's management,
---
all told; and. 
---
These were the cows that milked hardest of all
---
they should not milk them fully; nor to the maids,; with the result that in
 course of time the cows would" go azew"--that
---
lest they should
 fail in the same way for lack of finger- grip
---
It was not
 the loss for the moment that made, but
---
there was for a time no talk
 in the barton, and
---
The only movements were those of the milkers' hands up and
 down, and the swing of the cows' tails. 
---
Thus they all worked on,
.


---
encompassed by the vast flat mead which extended to either slope
 of the valley-- a level landscape compounded of old landscapes long
 forgotten, and, no doubt, differing in character very greatly from
 the landscape they composed now
---
, the cows do n't gie
 down their milk to- day as usual. 
---
if Winker do begin

---
because there's a new hand
---
"' Tis come among us
---
," said Jonathan Kail.

---
It may be so. 
---
that it goes up into their horns at such times
---
" I've noticed such things afore."

 I did n't think o't."

" I've been told," said
 a dairymaid.


---
as though even witchcraft might be limited by anatomical
 possibilities
---
as nott
 cows will keep it back as well as the horned ones
---
Do ye know that riddle about the nott cows, Jonathan?

---
as though even witchcraft might be limited by anatomical
 possibilities," I could n't say; I certainly could not.  But as nott
 cows will keep it back as well as the horned ones, I do n't quite
 agree to it.  Why do nott cows give less milk in a year than horned?"


---
" I do n't!"" Why do they?"


---
Because there bain't so many of' em," said the dairyman.

---
" Howsomever, these gam'sters do certainly keep back their milk
 to- day. 
---
Folks, we must lift up a stave or two
---
-- that's the only cure
 for't."


---
Songs were often resorted to in dairies hereabout as an enticement
 to the cows;
 and
---
when they showed signs of withholding their usual yield
---
the band of milkers at this request burst into melody-- in purely
 business- like tones
---
, it is true, and. 
---
with no great spontaneity; the
 result, according to their own belief, being a decided improvement
 during the song's continuance
---
You should get your harp, sir; not but what a fiddle is best."


---
who had given ear to this
---
the words were addressed to
 the dairyman
---
A reply, in the shape of" Why?"
 came
---
as it were out of the belly of a dun cow in the stalls
---
it had

---
; been spoken by a milker behind the animal,.


---
" Oh yes; there's nothing like a fiddle
---
," said the dairyman.
---
that bulls are
---
more moved by a tune than cows
---
-- at least
 that's my experience
---
a
 field lying that way,
---
where a bull was out to grass
---
The bull softened down,
 and. 
---
who fiddled on and on
---
than the
 bull would stop and
---
that nobody would come that way for hours
---
that' a did n't know
---
There's only this last tune between me and eternal
 welfare
---
It was not Christmas Eve then, but
---
never such a fool as that bull looked
---
It's a curious story
---
"; it carries us back to medieval times,!"


---
when
 faith was a living thing
---
The remark, singular for a dairy- yard, was murmured by the voice
 behind the dun cow; but
---
as nobody understood the reference
---
," said the person behind the dun cow.


---
But no explanation was discernible
---
" Take it gentle, sir; take it gentle," said the dairyman. 
---
that does it
---
my
 fingers ache
---
Beneath it was something educated, reserved, subtle,
 sad, differing.


---
Such
 vicissitudes had and
---
But it passed away. 
---
Without the milking- gear nobody could have guessed. 
---
When the milking was finished for the evening
---
they straggled
 indoors,.


---
where Mrs Crick, the dairyman's wife--, and wore a hot stuff gown in
 warm weather--
---
because the dairymaids wore prints
---
, most of the helpers going to their homes
---
It was a large room over the milk- house, some thirty feet long
---
; the
 sleeping- cots of the other three indoor milkmaids being in the same
 apartment. 
---
who occupied an adjoining bed
---
to be generated by the darkness in which they
 floated
---
that is learning, and
---
that plays
 the harp--
---
" Yes--, they say-- the
 last of the old Low Church sort
---
, they tell me--
---
for all about here be
. 
---
what they call High
---
not at this hour the curiosity to ask
---
as
 circumstances might decide
---
This lady had
---
The Vicar having opened it and

---
it to contain a book
---
Why has this been sent to my house
---
" It was ordered, sir."

"
---
Oh, it has been misdirected
---
" What do you know about it?"


---
" How can you think of reading it?"


---
Why-- it is a system of philosophy. 
---
There is no more
 moral, or even religious."


---
, work published
---
who intend
---
Since you have alluded to the matter, father
---
There is no
 institution for whose history I have a deeper admiration; but
---
as my brothers are
---
It had never occurred to
---
; a firm believer-- not as the phrase is now
, but in the old and ardent sense of the Evangelical school:
 one who could


               Indeed opine
         That the Eternal and Divine
         Did, eighteen centuries ago
         In very truth...



---
elusively construed by theological thimble- riggers in the Church and
 out of it
---
as required by the
 Declaration
---
My whole instinct in matters of religion
 is towards reconstruction
---
that are shaken
---
that are made
---
which can not be shaken
---
that those things may remain
---
if it is not
---
But the Vicar's view of that seat of learning as a
 stepping- stone to Orders alone was quite a family tradition; and.


---
that perseverance began, and

---
who had been and
---
The effects of this decisive debate were not long in showing
 themselves. 
---
unless there were good new resolutions in its
 representatives
---
what the world was like
---
But something had
---
who was starting on a thriving life
 as a Colonial farmer
---
that this might be a lead
 in the right direction
---
as there were no houses near at hand
---
It could only be reached by a ladder from the
 cheese- loft, and. 
---
could often be heard by the dairy- folk pacing up and down
---
when the
 household had gone
---
A portion was divided off at one end by
 a curtain,
---
who all together formed
 a lively assembly
---
several joined the family at meals. 
---
personified in the newspaper- press by the pitiable dummy known as
 Hodge
---
At close
 quarters no Hodge was. 
---
At first, it is true,
---
, seemed a little strange. 
---
Sitting down as a
 level member of the dairyman's household seemed at the outset an
 undignified proceeding. 
---
The ideas, the modes, the surroundings,
 appeared retrogressive and unmeaning. 
---
But with living on there,
 day after day, the acute sojourner became conscious of a new aspect
 in the spectacle. 
---
Without any objective change whatever, variety
 had taken the place of monotonousness. 
---
as they became
---
The typical and unvarying Hodge ceased. 
---
who had private views of each other,
---
who could applaud or
---
The early mornings were still sufficiently cool to render a fire
 acceptable in the large room
---
wherein they breakfasted; and,
---
who held
---
, assisted by a
 secondary light of cold blue quality which shone down the chimney
---
while to the side
 was the milk- house door,
---
through which were visible the rectangular
 leads in rows, full to the brim with the morning's milk
---
At the
 further end the great churn could be seen, and
---
its
 slip- slopping heard--.


---
just come by
 post
---
the other maids talked so much, and
---
the music- sheet rolled
 to the hearth. 
---
it seemed; also at the two
 chimney crooks dangling down from the cotterel, or cross- bar, plumed
 with soot, which quivered to the same melody
---
it is the new one
---
that our
 souls can be made
---
when we are alive
---
( breakfasts were
 breakfasts here) like the beginning of
 a gallows.


---
And is it so, maidy
---
'em go
---
"," is to lie on the
 grass at night and look straight up at some big bright star; and, by
 fixing your mind upon it, you will soon find."


---
that you are hundreds
 and hundreds o' miles away from your body, which you do n't seem to
 want at all
---
" Now that's a rum thing, Christianer-- hey? 
---
To think o' the miles
, courting, or
 trading, or for doctor, or for nurse, and yet never had the least
 notion o'."


---
that it was
 only a fancy
---
that perceives itself
---
What a fresh and virginal daughter of Nature that milkmaid is
---
that was familiar
---
before the necessity of taking thought had made the heavens gray
---
A
 casual encounter during some country ramble and
---
it certainly had been,

---
In general the cows were milked, without
 fancy or choice. 
---
as they presented themselves
---
But certain cows will show a fondness for a
 particular pair of hands,.


---
, the pail of a
 stranger being unceremoniously kicked over
---
It was Dairyman Crick's rule to insist on breaking down these
 partialities and aversions by constant interchange, since otherwise,
 in the event of a milkman or maid going away from the dairy. 
---
just as they
 came
---
that their order could not be the result of accident
---
The
 dairyman's pupil had lent a hand in getting the cows together of
 late, and
---
Mr Clare, you have ranged the cows!
---
Well, it makes no difference
---
" You will always be here."


---
" Do you think so? 
---
when the milking was over
---
It was a typical summer evening in June, so transmissive that inanimate objects
 seemed endowed with two or three senses, if not five. 
---
the atmosphere being in
 such delicate equilibrium and
---
There was no
 distinction between the near and the far, and
---
an auditor felt close
 to everything within the horizon. 
---
It was

---
broken by the strumming of strings.


---
Dim,
 flattened,
---
when they wandered in the still air with a stark
 quality like that of nudity
---
To speak absolutely, both instrument
 and execution were poor; but
---
the relative is all, and
---
which sent up mists of pollen at a touch
---
tall
 blooming weeds emitting offensive smells-- weeds
---
with whose red and yellow
 and purple hues formed a polychrome as dazzling as that of cultivated
 flowers. 
---
that
 were underfoot,,

---
The exaltation came now without any determination of hers
---
The floating
 pollen seemed. 
---
Though near
 nightfall, the rank- smelling weed- flowers glowed as if they would not
 close for intentness, and the waves of colour mixed with the waves of
 sound.


---
which still shone
---
The light was derived mainly from a large hole in
 the western bank of cloud
---
; it was like a piece of day left behind
 by accident, dusk having closed in elsewhere. 
---
another might be begun
---
What makes, Tess?
---
you draw off in that way
---
" Are you
 afraid?"


---
especially just now when the
 apple- blooth is falling, and
---
everything is so green."


---
" But you have your indoor fears-- eh?"

" Well-- yes, sir."


---
The milk turning sour?"

" No."


---
This hobble of being alive is rather
 serious?"


---
, do n't you think so
---
" It is--
---
now you put it that way."


---
is it
---
How you do?"


---
" The trees have inquisitive eyes,
---
as
 if they had
---
And the river says,--'Why do ye trouble me with your
 looks?' 
---
And you seem; but
---
the first of them the biggest and clearest, the others getting
 smaller and smaller
---
as they stand farther away
---
they all seem
 very fierce and cruel and! 
---
if they said,
---
as if they said,' I'm coming But YOU, sir, can raise up dreams with your
 music, and!"


---
which might almost have been called those
 of the age
---
what are called advanced ideas
---
that are really in
 great part but
---
Still, it was strange
---
; it was impressive, interesting, pathetic.

---
there was very
 good reason
---
two or three years ago--"My soul chooseth
 strangling and death rather than my life
---
It was true. 
---
that was
---
Thus, neither having the clue to the other's secret, they were
 respectively, and.



---
what each revealed
---
" Why do you look so woebegone all of a sudden?
---
what might have been with me
---
My life looks! 
---
if it had

---
what you know
---
, what you
 have read, and, and
---
When I see what you know, what you
 have read, and seen, and thought, I feel what a nothing I am!  I'm
 like the poor Queen of Sheba who lived in the Bible.  There is no
 more spirit in me."


---
any line of reading you
 would like
---
up--"

" It is a lady again
---
the bud peeled
---
that there are always more ladies than lords
---
when you come

---
Would you like?"


---
that there is
---
Because what's the use of learning-- finding out set down in some old book somebody
 just like me, and
---
" to know; making me
 sad, that's all. 
---
The best is not."


---
that your nature and
 your past doings have been just like thousands' and thousands', and
 that your coming life and doings'll be like thousands's and
 thousands'
---
" What, really, then, you do n't want?"


---
why-- why the sun do shine on the just and
 the unjust alike
---
" But that's."


---
what books will not tell me
---
that such a daughter of the
 soil could only have caught up the sentiment by rote
---
Barren attribute.


---
that it
 stands
---
that old families have done their spurt of work in
 past days, and
---
There's the
 Billets and the Drenkhards and the Greys and the St Quintins and
 the Hardys and the Goulds, who used to own the lands for miles down
 this valley
---
; you could buy'em all up now for an old song a'most.

---
, you know
---
you'll
 never make a good dairymaid
---
All your skill was used up ages ago
 in Palestine, and
---
you must lie fallow for a thousand years!' 
---
when we asked

---
even
 though it was so unusually old
---
The season developed and. 
---
Another year's instalment of
 flowers, leaves, nightingales, thrushes, finches, and such ephemeral
 creatures, took up their positions. 
---
others had

---
where only a year ago stood in their place
---
when these were nothing more than germs and
 inorganic particles
---
Rays from the sunrise drew forth the buds and
 opened petals, and.


---
Dairyman Crick's household of maids and men lived on comfortably,
 placidly, even merrily. 
---
Their position was perhaps the happiest of
 all positions in the social scale,
---
at which
 neediness ends
---
the stress of threadbare modishness
 makes too little of enough.


---
when arborescence seems
---
All the while they were converging, under an
 irresistible law, as surely as two streams in one vale.


---
which had rooted down to a poisonous stratum on the spot of
 its sowing
---
The
 sapling had been transplanted to a deeper soil. 
---
; no reflections
 have set in,? 
---
" Whither does this new current tend

---
What does it mean to my future? 
---
How does it stand
 towards my past?"


---
They met continually
---
; they could not help it. 
---
They met daily in that
 strange and solemn interval,
---
the twilight of the morning, in the
 violet or pink dawn; for it was necessary, so very
 early, here. 
---
before the milking came
 the skimming, which began at a little past three
---
It usually fell
 to the lot of some one or other of them
---
, the first
 being aroused by an alarm- clock; and,
---
they soon discovered
---
though the alarm as others did
---
The remaining maids and the
 dairyman usually gave themselves another turn on the pillow, and.


---
The gray half- tones of daybreak are not the gray half- tones of the
 day's close,. 
---
though the degree of their shade may be the same
---
In
 the twilight of the morning, light seems active, darkness passive
---
;
 in the twilight of evening it is the darkness which is active and
 crescent, and the light which is the drowsy reverse.


---
the first two persons
 to get up at the dairy- house
---
Being so often-- possibly not always by chance--, they seemed to themselves the first
 persons up of all the world. 
---
which pervaded the open mead
---
The spectral, half- compounded,
 aqueous light impressed them with
 a feeling of isolation,. 
---
as if they were Adam and Eve
---
the rest were nowhere.


---
in which they walked along
 together to the spot where the cows lay
---
The mixed, singular, luminous gloom often made. 
---
It was then,.

---
Then it would grow lighter, and
---
; they had changed from those of a divinity who could confer
 bliss to those of a being who craved it.


---
At these non- human hours they could get quite close to the waterfowl.

---
Herons came, with a great bold noise as of opening doors and
 shutters, out of the boughs of a plantation which they frequented at
 the side of the mead; or,
---
as the pair walked by,,
 like the turn of puppets by clockwork
---
They could then see the faint summer fogs in layers, woolly, level,
 and apparently no thicker than counterpanes,. 
---
where the cows had lain through the night-- dark- green
 islands of dry herbage the size of their carcasses
---
From each island proceeded a serpentine trail, by which
 the cow had rambled away
---
Then they drove the animals back to the barton,
 or.


---
as the case might require
---
Or perhaps the summer fog was more general, and
---
the meadows lay like
 a white sea, out of which. 
---
the scattered trees rose like dangerous
 rocks
---
Birds would soar through it into the upper radiance, and
. 
---
the wing sunning themselves, or
---
which now shone like glass rods
---
When the day grew quite
 strong and
---
About this time they would hear Dairyman Crick's voice,.

"
---
if the London folk only knowed of thee and thy slovenly ways
---
Upon my soul,
, they'd
 swaller their milk and butter more mincing than they do a'ready; and

---
that's saying a good deal."


---
The milking progressed, till towards the end Tess and Clare, in
 common with the rest.




---
the heavy breakfast table dragged
 out from the wall in the kitchen by Mrs Crick,; the same horrible scrape
 accompanying its return journey when the table had been cleared
---
this being the
 invariable preliminary to each meal
---
There was a great stir in the milk- house just after breakfast. 
---
The
 churn revolved as usual, but
---
the butter would not come. 
---
Whenever
 this happened
---
the dairy was paralyzed. 
---
they waited
 for
---
who kept the horse
---
Even the
 melancholy horse himself seemed.

"'!"

---
, believe in en;
---
that they used
---
," said Jonathan Kail.

---
" My grandfather used
---
a' were
---
grandf'er say,"
---
, so I've heard. " But there's no such genuine folk about nowadays!"


---
Mrs Crick's mind kept nearer to the matter in hand.


---
" Perhaps somebody in the house is in love
---
that that will cause it
---
we had years ago
---
how the butter
 did n't come then--"

"
---
Ah yes, yes!--but that is n't the rights o't. 
---
It had nothing to do
 with the love- making. 
---
we had here as milker at one
 time, sir
---
One Holy
 Thursday of all days in the almanack, we was here
---
as we mid be now
---
The dairyman paused, and
---
one or two words of comment came from the
 listeners.


---
Dairyman Crick's stories often seemed. 
---
when they were not
 really so,
---
strangers were betrayed into premature interjections
 of finality
---
; though old friends knew better
---
The narrator went on--

"
---
there churn
---
Without saying a word( it was turned by
 handpower then), and
---
Jack began. '
---
You call me old witch, do ye, you
 deceiver!'
---
when ye ought
---
Well, none of us ventured; and
---
And so it ended that day."


---
While the listeners were smiling their comments
---
there was a
 quick movement behind their backs, and
---
they looked round. 
---
It was warm, and
---
you must
---
we
 shall be finely put to for want of' ee by dog- days,?"


---
sha n't we, Mr
 Clare
---
Tis coming
---
!" cried Mrs Crick, and
---
When the evening milking
 was done
---
otherwise; none of
 them but herself seemed
---
to see the sorrow of it; to a certainty, not
 one knew.

---
whose friendship outworn
---
In these long June days the milkmaids, and, indeed, most of the
 household, went to bed at sunset or sooner, the morning work before
 milking being so early and heavy at a time of full pails. 
---
them undressing in the orange light
 of the vanished sun, which flushed their forms with its colour
---
They were
 standing in a group, in their nightgowns,, at the window,
 the last red rays of the west. 
---
All were watching somebody in the garden with
 deep interest.


---
, their three faces close together: a jovial and round
 one, a pale one with dark hair, and a fair one whose tresses were
 auburn
---
You can see as well as I
---
the others looked again.

"
---
You need n't say anything, Izz
---
" WHAT did you see
---
who was

---
Well, there was no harm in it
---
There-- you've owned it!"


---
have you
---
" It is silly. 
---
though we need not own it to other folks
---
The listener grew warm.


---
We sha n't, either of us
---
which is worse still
---
";," said the eldest.

---
They all three blew him a silent kiss.

"
---
There was a reflective silence.


---
" But how silly all this is!"
---
One sighed, and
---
another sighed, and
---
Somebody in bed hard by sighed too. 
---
They
 watched silently a little longer, their three faces still close
 together as before, and the triple hues of their hair mingling. 
---
, the shades beginning to deepen, they crept into their beds
---
In a few minutes they heard.

---
This
 conversation was another of the bitter pills. 
---
But the grave
 question was,? 
---
There was, hardly a
 ghost of a chance for either of them, in a serious sense; but
---
there
 was, or. 
---
Such unequal attachments had led to marriage;
 and
---
who had religiously determined

---
They came downstairs; but
---
they went indoors to breakfast.

---
Dairyman Crick was discovered. 
---
received a letter, in which a customer had complained.

"
---
that the butter
 had a twang
---
And begad, so' t have!"
---
There certainly was a twang.


---
The dairyman, better
 realize the taste, and!
---
to which it appertained, suddenly exclaimed--

"' Tis garlic
---
there was n't a blade left in that mead
---
Then all the old hands remembered
---
into which
 a few of the cows had been admitted of late
---
that a certain dry mead,, had, in years gone by
---
The dairyman had not recognized
 the taste at that time, and.


---
the butter bewitched
---
We must overhaul that mead
---
;" this must n't continny!"


---
All having armed themselves with old pointed knives
---
, they went out
 together. 
---
As the inimical plant could only be present in very
 microscopic dimensions
---
to have escaped ordinary observation, to
 find it seemed rather a hopeless attempt in the stretch of rich
 grass before them. 
---
all
 assisting,
---
With eyes fixed upon the ground they crept slowly across a strip of
 the field, returning a little further down in such a manner
---
when they should have finished
---
It was a most
 tedious business, not more than half a dozen shoots of garlic being
 discoverable in the whole field; yet
---
such was.


---
the herb's pungency
 that probably one bite of it by one cow had been sufficient to season
 the whole dairy's produce for the day
---
as they
 did
---
Differing one from another in natures and moods so greatly, they yet formed,; and
---
an alien observer passing down the neighbouring lane
 might well have been excused for massing them as" Hodge". 
---
As they
 crept along,,.


---
a soft yellow gleam
 was reflected from the buttercups into their shaded faces,
---
though the sun was pouring upon their
 backs in all the strength of noon
---
It was not,
 of course, by accident.


---
" Well, how are you
---
As they had been discussing a score of personal matters only
 half- an- hour before
---
, the introductory style seemed a little
 superfluous. 
---
But they got no further in speech just then. 
---
They
 crept and
---
who
 came next
---
Upon my soul and body, this here stooping do fairly make my back
 open and shut!
---
maidy Tess, you
 was n't well a day or two ago
---
" And you,-- this will make!

---
your head ache finely
---
if you feel fainty
---
Dairyman Crick withdrew, and
---
" Do n't they look pretty?
---
" Though, poor dears, prettiness wo n't last long!"


---
" They are excellent dairywomen."


---
" They skim better than I.
---
"

" Do they?"


---
if you really do want a dairywoman and
 not a lady
---
even if
 their juxtaposition were purely accidental
---
The hot weather of July had crept upon them, and
---
the
 atmosphere of the flat vale hung heavy as an opiate over the
 dairy- folk, the cows, and the trees. 
---
Hot steaming rains fell
 frequently,.


---
where the cows fed yet more rank, and

---
It was Sunday morning
---
; the milking was done
---
; the outdoor milkers
 had gone home. 
---
, the whole bevy having agreed. 
---
which lay some three or four miles distant from the
 dairy- house
---
All the preceding afternoon and night heavy thunderstorms had hissed
 down upon the meads, and; but

---
this morning the sun shone out all the more brilliantly for the
 deluge, and
---
the air was balmy and clear.


---
The crooked lane leading from their own parish to Mellstock ran along
 the lowest levels in a portion of its length, and
---
they found. 
---
that the result of the
 rain had been
---
This would have been no serious hindrance on a week- day
---
; they
 would have clicked through it in their high pattens and boots quite
 unconcerned; but
---
when flesh
 went forth to coquet with flesh
---
on this day of vanity, this Sun's- day, while hypocritically affecting
 business with spiritual things; on this occasion for wearing their
 white stockings and thin shoes, and their pink, white, and lilac
 gowns, on which every mud spot would be visible
---
, the pool was an
 awkward impediment. 
---
They could hear the church- bell calling-- as yet
 nearly a mile off.

"
---
Who would have expected such a rise in the river in summer- time!"

---
on which they had
 climbed, and
---
till they were past the pool
---
We ca n't get there anyhow, without walking right through it, or else
; and
---
that would make us so very late!"

---
all the
 people staring round
---
till we get into the That- it- may- please- Thees
---
While they stood.


---
they heard a splashing round
 the bend of the road, and
---
Four hearts gave a big throb simultaneously.


---
if the damage to the hay by the flood was
 considerable or not
---
though they had been
---
that the water had risen at
 that spot, and
---
that it would quite check their progress
---
The rosy- cheeked, bright- eyed quartet looked so charming in their
 light summer attire,,. 
---
Their gauzy skirts had brushed up from the grass innumerable
 flies and butterflies which, unable to escape, remained caged in
 the transparent tissue as in an aviary. 
---
Are you trying
---
" Yes, sir; and' tis getting late; and
---
my colour do come up so--"


---
as if one heart beat through them
---
" It is the only way for you to get past. 
---
Nonsense-- you
 are not too heavy! 
---
That's."


---
suggested by hers
---
They disappeared, and
---
where they were
---
they could hear
---
There's nothing in that
---
There's a time for everything
---
" A time
 to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing; the first is now

---
" Fie-- it is Scripture, Izz!"


---
to whom three- quarters of this performance was a
 commonplace act of kindness,
---
" It will soon
 be you and I." 
---
There was an understanding between them.


---
the distant three in a
 group, standing
---
You must be so tired, Mr Clare!"


---
Three Leahs to get one Rachel
---
they went some steps in silence.


---
You are like an
 undulating billow warmed by the sun. 
---
And all this fluff of muslin
 about you is the froth."


---
" It is very pretty--."


---
" Do you know?"


---
The water came up so sudden."


---
That the rise in the water was
---
the state of breathing belied. 
---
No definite words of love had crossed their lips
 as yet, and suspension at this point.
---
at last they came to the bend, and
---
the rest of their
 progress was in full view of the other three. 
---
The dry land was
, and
---
The four moved on together as before,
---
" What do you mean?"
---
We could see it. 
---
with which they had set out
---
The gaiety had somehow vanished; and

---
yet there was no enmity or malice between them. 
---
They were generous
 young souls
---
; they had been reared in the lonely country nooks where
 fatalism is a strong sentiment, and
---
Such
 supplanting was.


---
There was. 
---
And yet that
 same hungry nature had fought against this, but too feebly, and
---
the
 natural result had followed.


---
would you? 
---
" It can not be! 
---
So the reserve went off, and.


---
they were confiding and warm
---
whose mood was

---
who's asked me twice
---
-- my soul-- I would put an end
 to myself!  Why do n't ye speak, Izz?"


---
The air of the sleeping- chamber seemed. 
---
They writhed feverishly under the
 oppressiveness of an emotion thrust on them by cruel Nature's law-- an
 emotion which they had neither expected nor desired. 
---
The incident
 of the day had fanned the flame that was burning the inside of their
 hearts out, and
---
the torture was almost more than they could endure.

---
which distinguished them
---
as individuals were
 abstracted by this passion, and
---
each was but portion of one organism
 called sex
---
There was so much frankness and so little jealousy
. 
---
because there was no hope
---
its lack of everything to justify its existence in the eye
 of civilization()
---
that it did exist,
---
the one
 fact ecstasizing them to a killing joy
---
They tossed and.


---
they say
---
" O yes--'tis whispered
---
, they say. 
---
They had heard so very little of this; yet
---
it was enough to build up
 wretched dolorous dreams upon, there in the shade of the night. 
---
Thus
 they talked, and.


---
till sleep charmed their sorrow
 away
---
And the thorny crown of this sad
 conception was
---
when the rush of juices could almost be heard below the hiss
 of fertilization
---
Amid the oozing fatness and warm ferments of the Froom Vale, at a
 season, it was impossible that the most fanciful love
 should not grow passionate. 
---
there were

---
The ready bosoms existing impregnated by their surroundings.


---
which came
 in its wake
---
the Thermidorean weather seemed an effort on the part of Nature to match the state
 of hearts at Talbothays Dairy. 
---
The air of the place, so fresh in the
 spring and early summer, was stagnant and enervating now. 
---
Its heavy
 scents weighed upon them, and
---
at mid- day the landscape seemed.
---
Ethiopic scorchings browned the upper slopes of the
 pastures, but
---
there was still bright green herbage here where the
 watercourses purled. 
---
The rains having passed
---
, the uplands were dry. 
---
The wheels of the
 dairyman's spring- cart, licked up the
 pulverized surface of the highway, and. 
---
were followed by white ribands
 of dust,
---
as if they had set a thin powder- train on fire
---
The cows
 jumped wildly over the five- barred barton- gate,
---
maddened by the
 gad- fly
---
permanently rolled up
 from Monday to Saturday; open windows had no effect in ventilation
 without open doors, and
---
in the dairy- garden the blackbirds and
 thrushes crept about under the currant- bushes, rather in the manner
 of quadrupeds than of winged creatures. 
---
The flies in the kitchen
 were lazy,.
---
Conversations were concerning sunstroke
---
They milked entirely in the meads for coolness and convenience,
 without driving in the cows. 
---
During the day the animals obsequiously
 followed the shadow of the smallest tree; and
---
as it moved round the stem
 with the diurnal roll
---
when the milkers came
---
they could hardly
 stand still for the flies.


---
On one of these afternoons four or five unmilked cows chanced. 
---
Soon the sound of
 Old Pretty's milk fizzing into the pail came through the hedge, and

---
But a few-- mainly the younger
 ones-- rested their heads sideways. 
---
the sun chancing
---
was remarkable
---
Yet there was nothing ethereal
 about it
---
; all was real vitality, real warmth, real incarnation. 
---
that this culminated
---
But
 no-- they were not perfect. 
---
And it was the touch of the imperfect
 upon the would- be perfect that gave the sweetness, because it was
 that which gave the humanity.


---
actually produced, by some mysterious physiological
 process, a prosaic sneeze
---
though the curious dream- like
 fixity disappeared
---
a close eye might easily have discerned and
---
till only a tinge
 of it was left
---
The influence did not die down. 
---
Resolutions, reticences, prudences, fears,
 fell back like a defeated battalion. 
---
if the milcher had such a
 mind
---
Old Pretty by this time had looked round, puzzled; and.


---
where, by immemorial custom, there should
 have been only one,
---
what we mean
---
they stood together,. 
---
" Why do you cry, my darling?"
---
it distresses you
---
You will not think
---
been too quick and unreflecting, will you?"


---
" N'--I ca n't tell."


---
in a minute or two the
 milking of each was resumed
---
Nobody had beheld the gravitation of
 the two into one; and
---
when the dairyman came round by that screened
 nook a few minutes later
---
, there was not a sign to reveal that
 the markedly sundered pair were more to each other than mere
 acquaintance. 
---
which changed the pivot of the universe for
 their two natures
---
yet which was based
 upon a more stubborn and resistless tendency than a whole heap of
 so- called practicalities
---
A veil had been whisked aside
---
; the tract
 of each one's outlook was.



---
The night was as sultry as the day. 
---
There was no coolness after dark
 unless on the grass. 
---
Roads, garden- paths, the house- fronts, the
 barton- walls were warm as hearths, and.


---
Feeling had indeed smothered judgement that day.


---
Since the sudden embrace, three hours before, the twain had kept
 apart. 
---
what had occurred
---
what their mutual bearing should be before third parties
 thenceforward
---
,
 the absorbing scene had been imported
---
What had been the
 engrossing world
---
had dissolved into an uninteresting outer dumb- show
---
;
 while here, in this apparently dim and unimpassioned place, novelty
 had volcanically started up,.


---
; what was it now? 
---
The aged and lichened brick gables
 breathed forth"!" 
---
The windows smiled,
---
the door coaxed and
. 
---
, the creeper blushed
---
A personality within
 it was
---
whole overhanging sky throb with a burning
 sensibility. 
---
Whose was this mighty personality?
---
It was amazing, indeed,. 
---
though new love was
---
And to be held
 partly responsible for this, it was not solely so. 
---
that the magnitude of lives is not as to their
 external displacements,
---
The
 impressionable peasant leads a larger, fuller, more dramatic life
 than the pachydermatous king. 
---
that life
 was
---
what had begun
---
Living in such close relations, to meet meant to
 fall into endearment; flesh and blood could not resist it; and,

---
in which
 they would be mutually engaged
---
As yet the harm done was small.


---
But it was not easy to carry out the resolution. 
---
It might be possible
. 
---
when they sat down to breakfast at Talbothays Dairy
---
" O no," said Dairyman Crick. 
---
For four impassioned ones around that table the sunshine of the
 morning went out at a stroke, and
---
the birds muffled their song.

---
which unconsciously was brutal
---
How much longer is
---
The others waited for the dairyman's answer.


---
if their lives hung
 upon it
---
so I suppose."

" Well, I ca n't mind the exact day without looking at my
 memorandum- book," replied Crick, with the same intolerable unconcern.

---
" And even that may be altered a bit. 
---
which contained some black- puddings and a bottle of
 mead,
---
they
 were staring into next year, and not at the lane
---
;
 ought?  Dared? 
---
before they should have gone out to their parish duties
---
they had already sat down to the morning meal.

---
The group at the table jumped up. 
---
who had married a missionary and
---
A spiritual
 descendant in the direct line from Wycliff, Huss, Luther, Calvin; an
 Evangelical of the Evangelicals, a Conversionist, a man of Apostolic
 simplicity in life and thought, and. 
---
Once
 upon a time that it might have resulted far better for
 mankind. 
---
if Greece had been the source of the religion of modern
 civilization, and not Palestine; and
---
which could not realize
---
that there might lurk a
 thousandth part of a truth, much less a half truth or a whole truth,
 in such a proposition
---
the place felt like home; yet. 
---
which futilely attempt
---
only the great passionate pulse
 of existence, unwarped, uncontorted, untrammelled by those creeds
 to check what wisdom would be content to
 regulate
---
A prig would have said. 
---
Such was the
 contagion of domiciliary fellowship with the Talbothays nymphs and
 swains.


---
as are turned out yearly by
 the lathe of a systematic tuition
---
They were both somewhat
 short- sighted, and
---
when it was the custom to wear a single eyeglass
 and string
---
they wore a single eyeglass and string
---
when it was the
 custom to wear a double glass
---
; they wore a double glass
---
when it was
 the custom to wear spectacles
---
; they wore spectacles straightway, all
 without reference to the particular variety of defect in their own
 vision. 
---
When Wordsworth was
---
enthroned they carried pocket copies;
 and
---
when Shelley was belittled
---
they allowed. 
---
When Correggio's Holy Families were admired
---
, they
 admired Correggio's Holy Families
---
;, they sedulously followed suit without any personal
 objection.


---
Each
 brother candidly recognized; but
---
they were.


---
They were both dutiful and attentive sons, and. 
---
Neither had an adequate
 conception of the complicated forces at work outside the smooth and
 gentle current in which they and their associates floated. 
---
Neither
 saw the difference between local truth and universal truth
---
what
 the inner world said in their clerical and academic hearing
---
; that was quite
 a different thing from what the outer world was thinking.


---
it is farming or nothing for you now, my dear fellow
---
And, therefore, we must make the best of it. 
---
Farming, of course, means; but

---
But I do
.  high thinking may go with plain living, nevertheless."


---
it may
---
Was it
---
Why should
 you think, Felix, that I am likely to drop my high thinking and my
 moral ideals?"


---
-- it may be fancy
---
only-- that you were somehow losing
 intellectual grasp. 
---
Hasn't it struck you, Cuthbert?"


---
, you
 know
---
; each of us treading our allotted circles; but
---
if it comes to
 intellectual grasp
---
what has become of yours
---
They returned down the hill to dinner,
---
which was fixed at any time at
 which
---
Convenience as regarded afternoon callers was the last
 thing to enter into the consideration of unselfish Mr and Mrs Clare;
 though the three sons were sufficiently in unison on this matter to
 wish that their parents would conform a little to modern notions.


---
The walk had made them hungry,
---
But neither of the old
 people had arrived, and
---
it was not. 
---
till the sons were almost tired of
 waiting that their parents entered
---
The self- denying pair had been

---
whom they, somewhat inconsistently, tried
---
, their own appetites being quite forgotten.


---
The family sat down to table, and
---
a frugal meal of cold viands
 was deposited before them. 
---
as they
 did them at the dairy, and
---
" Ah! you are looking for the black- puddings,
---
that it would be a great
 pleasure to them
---
so we did."


---
that it was quite unfit for use as a beverage, but
---
We never drink spirits at this table, on principle
---
we enjoyed the mead and the black- puddings
 very much
---
if we did not
---
though that mead was a drop of pretty tipple
---
they use down at Talbothays
---
It was not till the evening, after family prayers,. 
---
When the service was
---
to see to all
 matters-- some one would be necessary
---
Would it not be
 well, therefore,?


---
do you think
---
who will be a help and a comfort to you in
 your goings- out and your comings- in
---
Beyond that, it really matters
 little. 
---
Such an one can be found
---
indeed, my earnest- minded friend
 and neighbour, Dr Chant--"

" But ought
---
It would be desirable." 
---
It is true. 
---
who is
---
It is a mere girlish
 outbreak which, I am sure, will not be permanent."


---
" Yes, yes; Mercy is good and devout,. 
---
But, father, do n't you
 think?"


---
who, in place of that lady's ecclesiastical accomplishments,
 understands the duties of farm life as well as a farmer himself,

---
such as you would care
---
who had come softly into the study
 during the conversation
---
what in common parlance is called a lady
---
" Mercy Chant is of a very good family."


---
Pooh!--what's the advantage of that, mother
---
who has
---
" Mercy is accomplished. 
---
And accomplishments have their charm,"

---
As to external accomplishments, what will be the use of them in the
 life
---
as you would say
---
what paper- poets only write
---
you desire
---
" O Angel, you are mocking!"


---
which
( never dreaming
---
They said
 finally.


---
that it was better not to act in a hurry, but
---
that they would
 not object
---
that,, there yet existed certain latent prejudices of theirs, as
 middle- class people, which it would require some tact to overcome
---
that education had as yet but
---
little affected the
 beats of emotion and impulse on which domestic happiness depends
---
It
 was probable
---
which had been brought under its influence
---
This belief was

---
which, having latterly been
 extended from the cultivated middle- class into the rural community,

---
whence one
 was
---
, though the most appreciative humanist, the most ideal
 religionist, even the best- versed Christologist of the three, there
 was alienation in the standing consciousness
---
The original d'Urbervilles decayed and. 
---
This seems
---
which had taken the name
---
they are spurious
---
But it is odd
. 
---
you express interest in old families
---
you set less
 store by them
---
You misapprehend me, father
---
"; you often do
---
" Politically I am sceptical as to the virtue of
 their being old.  Some of the wise even among themselves' exclaim
 against their own succession,'; but
---
as Hamlet puts it
---
been about to relate which was
---
This distinction, whose condition should have
. 
---
, this night thy
 soul shall be required of thee
---
you would not expose yourself
 to such gratuitous pain from scoundrels
---
Do you suppose? '
---
we bless
---
we suffer it
---
we entreat
---
; being defamed; we are made as the
 filth of the world, and as the offscouring of all things unto this
 day.' 
---
Those ancient and noble words to the Corinthians are strictly
 true at this present hour."


---
We'll hope
---
though on this side of the grave we shall probably never
 meet again
---
The same unworldliness was, and
---
what had necessitated
---
none the less. 
---
, the atmosphere grew heavier
---
which at this hour seemed
---
to descend from the upland to the fat
 alluvial soil below; the languid perfume
 of the summer fruits, the mists, the hay, the flowers, formed therein
 a vast pool of odour to make the animals,
 the very bees and butterflies drowsy.
---
them dotted about the meads
---
It was with a
 sense of luxury,
---
Not a human being was out of doors at the dairy. 
---
The denizens were
 all enjoying.

---
which the
 exceedingly early hours kept in summer- time
---
the usual afternoon nap of an hour or so rendered a necessity
---
bleached by infinite
 scrubbings
---
; the grunt and squeal of sweltering pigs
 arose from the still further distance. 
---
The large- leaved rhubarb and
 cabbage plants slept too,.


---
their broad limp surfaces hanging in the
 sun like half- closed umbrellas
---
the
 clock struck three. 
---
Three was the afternoon skimming- hour; and, with
 the stroke. 
---
as if it
 had been a snake's
---
It was a moment.


---
when the most spiritual beauty bespeaks itself
 flesh; and
---
; sex takes the outside place in the presentation
---
Mrs Crick is gone to market with Mr Crick, and
---
the others are gone out somewhere, and.
---
As they retreated to the milk- house
---
Deborah Fyander appeared on the
 stairs.


---
as you are very tired
---
, you
 need n't come down till milking- time
---
Possibly the Talbothays milk was
---
wherein familiar objects appeared
 as having light and shade and position, but no particular outline
---
for the unconstrained manners of Talbothays dairy
 came convenient now
---
, you see. 
---
Surely you love me?"


---
than anybody's in the
 world
---
," you are
---
"

" Then why do you refuse me?"


---
you to marry a lady
---
That was partly."


---
" Is it too sudden to be asked thus, my Pretty?"


---
If you will let
---
it pass
---
" It was very abrupt.

---
You quite misapprehend my parents
---
They are the most simple- mannered
 people alive, and quite unambitious. 
---
They are two of the few
 remaining Evangelical school. 
---
Tessy, are you an Evangelical?"


---
You go to church very regularly, and
---
our parson here is not very
 High
---
" It is often a great sorrow
 to me."


---
that, in reality, the confused beliefs,
 apparently imbibed in childhood
---
you looked a little downcast
---
when you came in
---
" Yes-- the subject always tends. 
---
, the more
 particularly earnestness does any good
---
there
 was quite a disturbance. 
---
when the
 probabilities were so obvious
---
that it would be useless
---
that good may be done indirectly
---
so they went
 on down the white row of liquid rectangles
---
till they had finished
 and
---
when the other maids returned, and
---
Deb came. 
---
It CAN'T be!"


---
that in the fields and pastures to" sigh gratis" is by no
 means
---
Tess, why did you say' no' in such a positive way?
---
" Your friends would scorn
 me."


---
Now-- you did not mean it
---
", sweet?--I am sure you
 did not! 
---
You have made me so restless that I can not read, or play,
 or do anything. 
---
that you will some day be mine-- any time you
 may choose
---
if they had been hieroglyphics
---
The denial seemed real.


---
" How can you ask?
---
that you do not
---
But then, why do you repulse me?"


---
you love me; and
---
you
 may always tell me
---
so as you go about with me-- and
---
" Ah-- that's different
---
-- it is for your good, indeed, my dearest!

---
, it is only for your sake
---
" But you will make me happy!"


---
" Ah-- you think so, but
---
you do n't know!"


---
which
 was certainly true,
---
The struggle was so fearful
---
that ought
---
It was only
 forty miles off
---
"-- why hasn't it reached here? 
---
Somebody must know!"


---
Yet nobody seemed
---
For two or three days no more was said. 
---
they could see for
 themselves.


---
The dairyman himself had been lending a hand; but

---
though they walked
 so circumspectly
---
that suspicion was
---
Anyhow, the
 dairyman left them to themselves.


---
They were breaking up the masses of curd before putting them into
 the vats. 
---
The operation resembled the act of crumbling bread on a
 large scale; and.

---
Although the early September weather was sultry
---
the cool arms
 flushed hot
---
Do you know, Tess
---
Because you love me very much!"


---
why you are so tantalizing
---
Why do you disappoint me so? 
---
You seem almost like a coquette, upon
 my life you do-- a coquette of the first urban water! 
---
They blow
 hot and blow cold,, and
---
just as you do
---
it is the very last sort of
 thing to expect to find in a retreat like Talbothays.
---
you to be the most honest, spotless creature that ever lived
---
if you love me
---
as you seem
---
" I have never said I do n't like the idea, and I never could say it;
 because-- it is n't true!"


---
that you wo n't belong
 to anybody but me
---
if you will let
---
me go now
---
" My Tess, no doubt,
 almost as many experiences as that wild convolvulus out there on the
 garden hedge, that opened itself this morning for the first time.

---
broken by momentary shoots of joy
---
: that was; and
---
what love counselled
---
The afternoon advanced, and
---
the dairyman, thinking
---
the cause to be love alone
---
that harassment could not be borne
---
for no inquiries were made
---
At half- past six the sun settled down upon the levels with
 the aspect of a great forge in the heavens; and
---
presently a monstrous
 pumpkin- like moon arose on the other hand. 
---
tortured out of their natural shape by incessant choppings
---
The pollard willows,
, became
 spiny- haired monsters. 
---
as they stood up against it
---
It was now Wednesday. 
---
The indoor
 milkmaids, Marian and the rest, seemed. 
---
that something
 definite was afoot,
---
who mid
---
" Now, ye think?"
---
said
 Dairyman Crick,.
---
just who mid
---
" Now, ye
 think?"


---
One guessed, and. 
---
Mrs Crick did not guess,.

"
---
Well," said the dairyman,"' tis that slack- twisted' hore's- bird of a
 feller, Jack Dollop. 
---
A villain-- to think o' that!" said a milker.


---
Never meant to," replied the dairyman.
---
They were married in a great hurry;
 and
---
as they've been leading ever since
---
" Well, the silly body should have told en sooner
---
," said Mrs Crick.


---
" Ay, ay," responded the dairyman indecisively. "
---
Still, you can see
 exactly how' twas. 
---
Do n't ye think?"


---
that was something like it,
 maidens
---
just before they went to church,
---
And what do you say, my dear?"
---
" Be cust," said Beck Knibbs, a married
 helper from one of the cottages. 
---
" All's fair in love and war. 
---
which followed this sally
---
What was comedy to them
---
; long locks
 of which weed had lodged against the piles driven to keep the cows
 from crossing.


---
Yes, there was the pain of it. 
---
It was.

" Tessy!
---
as if people should laugh at martyrdom
---
It all turned on that release. 
---
What had given her strength
---
that would have been overcome in another moment
---
Day after day they met-- somewhat less constantly than before; and

---
The end of September drew near, and

---
when the subject was under discussion
---
Neither a religious sense of a
 certain moral validity in the previous union nor a conscientious wish
 for candour could hold out against it much longer. 
---
the words were vain
---
who would
 love and,
 charges, or revelations
---
The season meanwhile was drawing onward to the equinox, and
---
though
 it was still fine
---
, the days were much shorter. 
---
The dairy had
---
" Now, Miss Flirt, before you go down
---
" It is a
 fortnight, and
---
this wo n't do any longer. 
---
You MUST tell
 me, or
---
what you mean
---
My door was
 ajar just now, and
---
You
 do n't know. 
---
Is it?"


---
it is too early to take me to
 task!
---
" You need not call me Flirt. 
---
me go
 downstairs
---
"' Twould mean"
---
, would n't it?
---
It would only mean;
 and
---
that you love me,
---
even if you can not marry me
---
you were so good as to own that long ago."

" Very well, then,'
---
The other maids were already down,
 and
---
the subject was not pursued. 
---
which, as the milk diminished with the
 approach of autumn, was a lessening process day by day--
---
The lovers followed them.


---
" Our tremulous lives are so different from theirs
---
, are they not?"
---
" Why do you think that?"


---
" There's
 more in those three than you think."


---
" What is in them?"


---
And perhaps they love you as well
 as I-- almost."


---
That was now done, and
---
They were joined by a milker from one of the cottages, and
---
no more
 was said on that. 
---
which concerned them so deeply
---
that
 this day would decide it
---
In the afternoon several of the dairyman's household and assistants
 went down to the meads as usual, a long way from the dairy, where
 many of the cows were milked without being driven home. 
---
The
 supply was getting less, and
---
as the animals advanced in calf
---
the
 supernumerary milkers of the lush green season had been dismissed.


---
The work progressed leisurely. 
---
Each pailful was poured into tall
 cans that stood in a large spring- waggon which had been brought
 upon the scene; and
---
when they were milked
---
, the cows trailed away.

---
who was there with the rest
---
We sha n't be
 soon enough with this milk at the station,. 
---
if we do n't mind
---
There's
 no time to- day to take it home and mix it with the bulk afore sending
 off. 
---
It must go. 
---
Who'll drive it
 across?"


---
pail and stool to the dairyman to take home, and

---
In the diminishing daylight they went along the level roadway through
 the meads, which stretched away into gray miles, and. 
---
were backed in
 the extreme edge of distance by the swarthy and abrupt slopes of
 Egdon Heath
---
On its summit stood clumps and stretches of fir- trees
---
,
 whose notched tips appeared like battlemented towers crowning
 black- fronted castles of enchantment.


---
They were so absorbed in the sense of being close to each other
---
that
 they did not begin for a long while
---
, the silence being broken
 only by the clucking of the milk in the tall cans behind them.

---
they followed
---
The lane was so solitary that the hazel nuts had
 remained on the boughs till they slipped from their shells, and the
 blackberries hung in heavy clusters. 
---
The dull sky soon began and
---
the stagnant air of the day changed into
 a fitful breeze which played about their faces. 
---
The quick- silvery
 glaze on the rivers and pools vanished
---
; from broad mirrors of light
 they changed to lustreless sheets of lead, with a surface like a
 rasp. 
---
slightly embrowned by the season
---
which the pressure of the cows' flanks had
---
, was made clammy by the moisture,.


---
till it hardly was
 better than seaweed
---
Remote Egdon disappeared by degree behind the liquid gauze. 
---
The
 evening grew darker, and
---
the roads being crossed by gates
---
, it was
 not safe. 
---
The air was rather
 chill.


---
perhaps the drizzle
 wo n't hurt you much. 
---
which was sometimes used
---
" Now we are all right again. 
---
Ah-- no we are not! 
---
It runs down into
 my neck a little, and it must still more into yours. 
---
That's better.

---
Your arms are like wet marble, Tess. 
---
if you stay quiet
---
Now,
, you will not get another drop. 
---
The only reply was the smack of
 the horse's hoofs on the moistening road, and the cluck of the milk
 in the cans behind them.


---
" Do you remember?"


---
what you said
---
Before we get home, mind."


---
As they drove on
---
, the fragment of an old manor
 house of Caroline date rose against the sky, and.

"
---
There
 is something very sad in the extinction of a family of renown,."


---
even
 if it was fierce, domineering, feudal renown
---
They crept along towards a point in the expanse of shade just at hand
. 
---
at which a feeble light was beginning
---
where, by day, a fitful white streak of steam at intervals upon the
 dark green background denoted intermittent moments of contact between
 their secluded world and modern life
---
Modern life stretched out its
 steam feeler to this point three or four times a day,.


---
what
 it touched
---
as if had been uncongenial
---
They reached the feeble light, which came from the smoky lamp of a
 little railway station; a poor enough terrestrial star, yet in one
 sense of more importance to Talbothays Dairy and mankind than the
 celestial ones to which it stood in such humiliating contrast. 
---
The
 cans of new milk were unladen in the rain
---
Then there was the hissing of a train, which drew up almost silently
 upon the wet rails, and
---
the milk was rapidly swung can by can into
 the truck. 
---
when they had
 wrapped themselves up over head and ears in the sailcloth again
---
, they
 plunged back into the now thick night
---
" Londoners will drink it at their breakfasts to- morrow,
---
wo n't they?
---
that we have never seen
---
they will
---
not as we send it
---
When its
 strength has been lowered
---
, so that it may not get up into their
 heads."


---
who have never seen a cow
---
" Who do n't know anything of us, and
---
where it comes from; or?"


---
how
 we two drove miles across the moor to- night in the rain
---
that it might
 reach'em in time
---
" We did not drive entirely on account of these precious Londoners;
---
we
 drove a little on our own-- on account of that anxious matter. 
---
you will
---
which
, I am sure,, dear Tess
---
You belong to me already
---
, you know
---
Does it not?"


---
" You know as well as I.  O yes-- yes!"

" Then, if your heart does, why not your hand?"


---
" My only reason was on account of you-- on account of a question. 
---
it to be entirely for my happiness,
---
if it is for your happiness and worldly convenience. 
---
" Well, it is for my convenience as well as my happiness. 
---
that you will stand in my way
---
you to know it
---
-- you must let!"


---
me tell
 you--
---
you will not like me so well
---
if you wish to, dearest
---
so, Anno Domini--"

" I was born at Marlott
---
as they were spoken
---
they said,. 
---
so it was settled
---
But there was trouble in my family
---
" And then-- there is something very unusual about it-- about me. 
---
And-- we are

---
" Well, it is true, in one sense. 
---
we ought
---
that as reasoners
 the only pedigrees to respect are those spiritual ones of
 the wise and virtuous, without regard to corporal paternity
---
-- you can have no idea! 
---
Are you
---
" Yes-- it is surprising
---
how many of the present tillers of the soil
 were once owners of it, and
---
that a certain school
 of politicians do n't make capital of the circumstance
---
they do n't
 seem... 
---
And
 this was the carking secret!"


---
Society is hopelessly snobbish,
 and
---
Tess, you must
 spell your name correctly-- d'Urberville-- from this very day."


---
, why dozens of mushroom
 millionaires would jump at such a possession! 
---
By the bye, there's
 one of that kidney who has taken the name-- where have I heard of
 him?--Up in the neighbourhood of The Chase
---
It is unlucky,
 perhaps!"


---
so you will escape yours! 
---
The secret is out,
---
so why should you
 any longer refuse me?"


---
If it is SURE, and
---
you
 feel VERY, VERY much--"


---
that you do wish
---
", that it is."


---
only your wanting me very much, and
---
whatever my offences, that would make

---
me feel
---
You will
---
"-- you do say it,! 
---
You will be mine for ever and
 ever."


---
" Why do you cry, dearest?"


---
" But this does not seem very much like gladness, my Tessy!"


---
if you love me
---
I said I would
 die unmarried!"

" But, you would like?"


---
that you are very much excited
---
that remark was not very
 complimentary
---
if you care for me
---
you would prove it in some way
---
But O, I sometimes wish I had never been born!"

" Now, my dear Tess, if I did not know,
 and very inexperienced, I should say.  I wish."

" How can I prove it more than I have done?"" Will this prove it more?"


---
There-- now do you believe?
---
So they drove on through the gloom,. 
---
the horse going, and
---
the rain driving against
 them
---
which pervades all creation
---
which sways humanity to its purpose,
---
as the tide sways the
 helpless weed
---
The" appetite for joy", that tremendous
 force, was.


---
not to be controlled by vague lucubrations over
 the social rubric
---
" You do n't mind?"


---
my doing
 that
---
You are a child to me, Tess,. 
---
how very proper it is
---
how
 wrong it would be in me
---
you would not dance with me.

---
that is of no ill- omen for us now
---
DEAR TESS,--

    J write these few lines Hoping they will find you well,
   . 
---
as they leave me at Present,
---
Dear
    Tess, we are all glad to Hear that you are going really
    to be married soon. 
---
But with respect to your question,
    Tess, J say between ourselves,
---
which, perhaps, your Intended is
    the same
---
why should
    you Trumpet yours? 
---
when others do n't Trumpet theirs
---
specially as it is so long
    ago, and not your Fault at all
---
J shall answer the
    same. 
---
if you ask me fifty times
---
Besides, you must bear
    in mind. 
---
that's in your heart
---
that, knowing it to be your Childish Nature to
    tell all-- so simple!--J made; and
---
you
    promise me
---
you most solemnly did
   
---
we mean,
---
knowing there
    is not much in your parts, and thin Sour Stuff what
    there is
---
Silence seemed, on the face of it,
---
The
 responsibility was shifted, and
---
The days of declining autumn beginning with the month of October, formed a season through
 which
---
all that goodness could be--. 
---
friend should know
---
that had no bottom to them
---
that is smouldering and dangerous
---
This amazed and enraptured Tess, whose slight experiences had been so
 infelicitous till now; and
---
They unaffectedly sought each other's company
---
since it
 must in its very nature carry with it a suspicion of art
---
Thus, during this October month of wonderful afternoons
 they roved along the meads by creeping paths which followed the
 brinks of trickling tributary brooks, hopping across by little wooden
 bridges to the other side, and back again. 
---
They were never out of
 the sound of some purling weir
---
, whose buzz accompanied their own
 murmuring,. 
---
while the beams of the sun, almost as horizontal as the
 mead itself, formed a pollen of radiance over the landscape
---
They
 saw tiny blue fogs in the shadows of trees and hedges, all the time
. 
---
that there was bright sunshine elsewhere
---
The sun was so near the
 ground, and the sward so flat,.


---
for it was the season for" taking
 up" the meadows, or digging the little waterways clear for the winter
 irrigation, and mending their banks where trodden down by the cows
---
The shovelfuls of loam, black as jet, brought there by the river
,.


---
when it was as wide as the whole valley
---
You are not ashamed of owning me as yours before them!
---
if it should reach the ears of your friends at Emminster
---
" O no!"

" But that
 you are walking about like this with me, a milkmaid--"

"
---
The most bewitching milkmaid ever seen."


---
" They might feel it a hurt to their dignity."


---
It is a
 grand card to play-- that of your belonging to such a family, and
---
Apart from that,
 my future is
---
to be totally foreign to my family-- it will not affect
 even the surface of their lives. 
---
We shall leave this part of
 England-- perhaps England itself-- and what does it matter how people
 regard us here? 
---
You will like
---
going, will you not?"


---
thus they went on, to a place where the reflected sun
 glared up from the river, under a bridge, with a molten- metallic glow
 that dazzled their eyes,. 
---
though the sun itself was hidden by the
 bridge
---
They stood still,
---
whereupon little furred and feathered
 heads popped up from the smooth surface of the water; but,
---
that the disturbing presences had paused, and
---
, they
 disappeared again. 
---
Upon this river- brink they lingered.


---
till the fog
 began
---
which was very early in the evening at
 this time of the year--
---
They walked later on Sundays,. 
---
when it was quite dark
---
who were also out of doors on the first Sunday evening
 after their engagement
---
though they were too far off
---
that they were waiting like wolves just outside the
 circumscribing light
---
A spiritual forgetfulness co- existed with an intellectual
 remembrance. 
---
that in the
 background those shapes of darkness were always spread
---
They might
 be receding, or
---
they might be approaching, one or the other, a little
 every day.



---
keeping house,
 all the other occupants of the domicile being away
---
As they talked

---
which was
 only the smaller part of it
---
you speak like it, dear Tess
---
Distinction does not
 consist in the facile use of a contemptible set of conventions, but
 in being numbered among those who are true, and honest, and just, and
 pure, and lovely, and of good report
---
as you are
---
" Why did n't you stay and? 
---
you danced on the green
---
did n't you, why did n't you
---
" That is. 
---
But you must not be so bitter in your regret--
---
why
 should you be?"


---
; the sticks snapped pleasantly, and
. 
---
Do you not think, Tess?"

---
you are just a wee bit capricious, fitful
---
just then you ran away
---
" What did you want
---
" Well, you love me, and
---
hence there
 follows a thirdly,'
---
When shall the day be?'"


---
, would n't it
 be best not to marry till after all that?--Though I ca n't bear the
 thought o' your going away and leaving me here
---
" Of course you cannot-- and
---
it is not best in this case. 
---
you
 to help me in many ways in making my start
---
When shall it be? 
---
The reality of marriage was. 
---
when it loomed so near
---
how it would be
---
they are sure to come and catch us
---
" I said to myself,!
 But I was though it might ha' seemed

---
you had n't told us,
---
that ye had been sitting anywhere at all in this light,
---
that shows that folks should never
 fancy other folks be supposing things when they bain't. 
---
We are going
---
you mid do such a thing for some time
---
what's more
---
who followed Crick than abashed by Crick's blunt
 praise
---
After supper,, they were all present. 
---
A
 light was burning, and
---
that there was no malice in their mood
---
They could scarcely feel as a loss what they had never expected to
 have. 
---
Their condition was objective, contemplative.


---
You BE going?"
---
They thought.


---
that this was evasiveness only
---
" How it do seem! 
---
because other lips have touched
 there by now
---
because we did not think
 of it--
---
Still, nobody else is-- no fine lady, nobody in silks and satins; but she who do live
 like we."


---
Are you sure you do n't dislike me for it
---
as if
 they considered
---
"

" That's
---
You are all better than I."

" We better than you?"
---
"

" You are!"
---
You are best for'n
---
But
 even you ought. 
---
You BE proud, I'm sure!"


---
When they were all in bed, and
---
the light was out
---
" You will think of us
---
we never hoped
---
The
 beginning of November found its date still in abeyance,. 
---
for a perpetual betrothal in which everything should remain
---
as it was
 then
---
The meads were changing now; but
---
it was still warm enough in early
 afternoons before milking to idle there awhile, and
---
the state of
 dairy- work at this time of year allowed a spare hour for idling.

---
Looking over the damp sod in the direction of the sun, a glistening
 ripple of gossamer webs was visible to their eyes under the luminary,
 like the track of moonlight on the sea. 
---
Gnats, knowing nothing
 of their brief glorification, wandered across the shimmer of this
 pathway,. 
---
if they bore fire within them
---
that the date was still the question
---
This was mostly a
 journey to the farmhouse on the slopes above the vale,. 
---
how
 the advanced cows were getting on in the straw- barton to which they
 were relegated
---
For it was a time of the year that brought great
 changes to the world of kine. 
---
which elapsed
---
before the calves were sold
---
In the
 interval there was, of
 course, little milking to be done, but as soon as the calf had been
 taken away the milkmaids would have to set to work as usual.


---
Returning from one of these dark walks they reached a great
 gravel- cliff immediately over the levels, where they stood still and
 listened. 
---
The water was now high in the streams,
---
squirting through
 the weirs, and tinkling under culverts; the smallest gullies were all
 full
---
; there was
---
foot- passengers
 were compelled. 
---
From the whole extent
 of the invisible vale came a multitudinous intonation
---
; it forced upon
 their fancy.


---
that a great city lay below them, and
---
that the murmur was
 the vociferation of its populace
---
It seems like tens of thousands of them
---
" No."

" The cows are going dry rapidly."


---
Six or seven went to the straw- barton yesterday, and three the
 day before, making nearly twenty in the straw already. 
---
Ah-- is it
? 
---
that the farmer do n't want my help for the calving
---
to--"

" Crick did n't exactly say
---
what our relations were
---
my asking
---
" Well, it is convenient
---
-- you have admitted that." 
---
We will not trifle--."


---
life is too serious
---
" It is. 
---
that before you did
---
for milkmaids were not in
 request now
---
no divine being like
---
since you will
 probably have
---
to leave at Christmas, it is in every way desirable and
 convenient
---
Besides,
 you would
 know."


---
that we could not go on like this for ever
---
we could
---
That it would always be summer and autumn, and!"


---
you
 always courting me, and
---
as you have
 done through the past summer- time
---
you will
---
Thus at last it was arranged between them, during that dark walk
 home, amid the myriads of liquid voices on the right and left.


---
When they reached the dairy Mr and Mrs Crick were promptly told-- with
 injunctions of secrecy
---
that the
 marriage should be kept as private as possible
---
Who would make
 the ornamental butter- pats for the Anglebury and Sandbourne ladies?

---
In point of fact Mrs Crick did remember

---
;
 but the superiority might have been a growth of the imagination aided
 by subsequent knowledge.


---
The word had been given
---
; the number of the day
 written down. 
---
who
 associate more extensively with natural phenomena than with their
 fellow- creatures
---
that such charms would be found behind the scenes
---
Unsophistication
 was a thing to talk of; but
---
how it really struck one

---
it might be a year or two. 
---
Do n't you think
---
for us to wait
---
till you
 were quite settled in your midland farm
---
( A midland farm was the idea just then.)


---
The reason was a good one,. 
---
so far as it went
---
that lodgings
 were
---
which, before its
 mutilation, had been the mansion of a branch of the d'Urberville
 family
---
This was always. 
---
They decided, and.


---
" Then we will start off
---
Questions of procedure such as these arose and and
---
The thirty- first of December, New Year's Eve, was
 the date. 
---
Could it ever be? 
---
shared
 by them
---
" You was not called home this morning."


---
" It should ha' been the first time of asking to- day. 
---
You meant
---
The other returned a quick affirmative.


---
" And there must be three times of asking. 
---
And now there be only two
 Sundays left between."


---
; of course there must be
 three. 
---
If so, there must be a week's
 postponement, and
---
that was unlucky. 
---
who had been so backward
---
Have ye forgot'em, Mr Clare? 
---
them tease you about the banns
---
A licence will be quieter
 for us, and
---
if you go to church on Sunday morning
---
So you will not hear your own
 name,."


---
if you wished to
---
that things were in train
---
But to know was an immense relief to Tess
 notwithstanding,. 
---
who had
---
that somebody would stand
 up and
---
" All this good
 fortune may be scourged out of me afterwards by a lot of ill. 
---
That's
. 
---
how Heaven mostly does
---
But everything went smoothly. 
---
they planned
---
How thoughtful you've been!"
---
the village sempstress to make a few alterations
---
while there were yet mere lover and mistress
---
they started together.


---
They went in the gig that day.


---
And then for the first time in their lives they shopped as partners
 in one concern. 
---
It was. 
---
Christmas Eve, with its loads a holly and
 mistletoe, and the town was very full of strangers who had come in
 from all parts of the country on account of the day
---
The general sitting- room was full of guests,
. 
---
who were continually going in and out
---
As the door opened and
---
though that village lay so many
 miles off that Trantridge folk
---
that," said the other
---
thus they parted,. 
---
As soon the young couple had driven off
---
unless I make a great mistake--"  I beg pardon, sir I thought."

 And was it a mistake?"
---
said the second one.


---
In the meantime the lovers were driving onward.


---
But I did n't want not I."

" Could we put off our wedding till a little later?"
---
if we wished
---
Do you mean?"
---
that the fellow may have
 time to summon me for assault
---
if it should have
---
was not very clear, and
---
" We shall go away, a very long distance, and no
 ghost of the past reach there
---
hundreds of miles
 from these parts, and such as this can never happen again,
---
They parted tenderly that night on the landing, and
---
lest
 the few remaining days should not afford sufficient time
---
Everybody else in the house was asleep, and
---
what was the matter
---
But the reason is rather an amusing one
---
who insulted you,

---
you heard
---
the noise was my pummelling away with my fists at
 my portmanteau,. 
---
Then,
 lest the flesh should again be weak
---
as it well might be
---
It came, as usual
---
Surely it was as warmly as ever!


---
So the day passed, and
---
it was evident. 
---
Could it be?
? 
---
It might be. 
---
thus New Year's Eve
 broke-- the wedding day.


---
The lovers did not rise at milking- time,
---
the dairy been accorded something
 of the position of guests
---
When they arrived downstairs at breakfast- time
---
they were
 surprised to see what effects had been produced in the large
 kitchen for their glory since they had last beheld it. 
---
At some
 unnatural hour of the morning the dairyman had caused. 
---
the yawning
 chimney- corner to be whitened, and
---
the brick hearth reddened, and
---
which had

---
a
 blazing yellow damask blower to be hung across the arch in place of
 the old grimy blue cotton one with a black sprig pattern formerly done duty there
---
This renovated aspect of what was the
 focus indeed of the room on a full winter morning.


---
" I was determined to do summat in honour o't", said the dairyman.
 as you would n't hear of my gieing a rattling good randy wi'
 fiddles and bass- viols complete, as we should ha' done in old times
---
" And,
 this was all I could think o' as a noiseless thing."


---
as a fact
 nobody was invited from Marlott
---
though
 a dairywoman was the last daughter- in- law they could have expected
---
than it would
 have done
---
It was a pretty lover's dream, if no more. 
---
The carpet reached close to
 the sill, and
---
There it
 was. 
---
The mountain had
. 
---
the house
 being in full bustle of preparation
---
as if it
 prevented a confession
---
that it need
 not
---
; there was still time. 
---
Yet everything was in a stir;
---
there
 was coming and
---
going; all had
---
to dress, the dairyman and Mrs Crick
 having been asked; and
---
reflection or
 deliberate talk was well- nigh impossible. 
---
when they met upon the landing
---
No, no-- we ca n't have faults talked of--
---
you must be deemed perfect
 to- day at least, my Sweet
---
" We shall have plenty of time,
 hereafter. 
---
" But it would be better
---
for me to do it now
---
so that you
 could not say--"


---
" Well, my quixotic one, you shall tell me anything-- say, as soon as
 we are settled in our lodging; not now. 
---
us spoil the day with them
---
But do not let; they will
 be excellent matter for a dull time."


---
" Then you do n't wish me to, dearest?"


---
The church was a long way off, and
---
they were obliged. 
---
particularly as it was winter
---
A closed carriage was ordered from
 a roadside inn, a vehicle which had been kept there ever since the
 old days of post- chaise travelling. 
---
It had stout wheel- spokes, and
 heavy felloes a great curved bed, immense straps and springs, and a
 pole like a battering- ram. 
---
, counter- acted by strong liquors-- who had stood at inn- doors
 doing nothing for the whole five- and- twenty years that had elapsed

---
the old times to come back again
---
that they did

---
They disapproved of the marriage, and. 
---
Perhaps it was as well.
---
that they could
 not be present
---
They were not worldly young fellows, but
---
fraternizing
 with dairy- folk would have struck unpleasantly upon their biased
 niceness, apart from their views of the match.


---
Upheld by the momentum of the time
---
they were taking to the
 church
---
; all the rest was
 a luminous mist. 
---
when they took their walks together
---
The marriage being by licence there were only a dozen or so of people
 in the church
---
the ordinary sensibilities of sex seemed a flippancy.

---
while they were kneeling together
---
the movement had been automatic,.


---
As they came out of church
---
the ringers swung the bells off their
 rests, and
---
a modest peal of three notes broke forth--. 
---
that limited
 amount of expression having been deemed sufficient by the church
 builders for the joys of such a small parish
---
the vibrant
 air humming round them from the louvred belfry in the circle of
 sound
---
till
 the sound of the church bells had died away, and
---
the emotions of the
 wedding- service had calmed down
---
Mr and Mrs Crick having directed their own gig
,
---
you seem oppressed, Tessy
---
It is all so serious, Angel. 
---
It is very odd
---
" Oh-- you have heard the legend of the d'Urberville Coach-- that
 well- known superstition of this county about your family when they
 were very popular here; and
---
this lumbering old thing reminds you of
 it."


---
since that time members of
 the family see or
---
it is rather gloomy
---
Evidently some dim knowledge of
 it has been brought back to your mind by the sight of this venerable
 caravan."


---
" Is it, or"

" Now, Tess!"


---
when we
 are going
---
that members of my family see it,
---
is it
?
---
when we have committed a crime
---
they reached home
---
Could intensity
 of love justify? 
---
what might be considered in upright souls as culpable
 reticence
---
" These violent
 delights have violent ends." 
---
It might be too desperate for human
 conditions-- too rank, to wild, too deadly.


---
you love
---
Afternoon came, and with it the hour for departure.
---
They had decided
. 
---
At two o'clock there was
 nothing left to do but to start. 
---
them go out
---
pensively inclining their heads
---
if they would appear at the parting moment
---
there they were, stoical and staunch to the last. 
---
Will you kiss'em all, once, poor things, for the first and last
 time
---
When they reached the door
---
as there might have been
---
If there had
---
it would have

---
all were
---
The kiss had

---
they were trying
---
before they had moved off
---
It was interrupted by the
 crowing of a cock. 
---
The white one with the rose comb had come and

---
" Oh?" said Mrs Crick. 
---
That's bad
---
"," one murmured to the other,.


---
that the words
 could be heard by the group at the door- wicket
---
" Well!" said the dairyman.


---
Just you be off, sir, or
---
" said the
 dairyman with some irritation,. 
---
" It only means a change in the weather
---
They drove by the level road along the valley to a distance of a few
 miles, and,,. 
---
which gives the place
 half its name
---
Immediately behind it stood the house.


---
whose exterior features are so well known to
 all travellers through the Froom Valley;
---
; it was too near a satire.


---
On entering they found. 
---
though they had only engaged a couple
 of rooms
---
that,, the farmer had taken advantage of their proposed presence
 during the coming days,

---
The absoluteness of possession pleased them, and.


---
they
 realized it as the first moment of their experience under their own
 exclusive roof- tree
---
When the carriage was gone
---
they ascended the stairs. 
---
, the charwoman showing the way
---
" What's the matter?
---
" How they
 frightened me."


---
As all visitors to the mansion are aware
---
, whose lineaments once seen can never be forgotten.

---
Whose portraits are those
---
that they were ladies of the
 d'Urberville family
---
Owing to their being builded into the wall they ca n't be moved
 away
---
The unpleasantness of the matter was. 
---
The place having
 been rather hastily prepared for them
---
, they washed their hands in one
 basin. 
---
Which are my fingers and
---
which are yours
---
" They are very much mixed."


---
They are all yours
---
; it was: but
---
They went into the ancient parlour to tea, and

---
here they shared their first common meal alone. 
---
Such was their
 childishness, or rather his. 
---
how utterly and
 irretrievably this little womanly thing is the creature of my good
 or bad faith and fortune
---
God
 forbid such a crime!"


---
They sat on over the tea- table. 
---
which the
 dairyman had promised
---
before it grew dark
---
But evening began
, and
---
the luggage did not arrive, and. 
---
they had brought
 nothing more than they stood in
---
With the departure of the sun the
 calm mood of the winter day changed. 
---
Out of doors there began noises
 as of silk
---
smartly rubbed; the restful dead leaves of the preceding
 autumn were stirred to irritated resurrection, and. 
---
It soon began.


---
" That cock knew
---
the weather was going
---
who had attended upon them
---
now they lit them. 
---
Each
 candle- flame drew towards the fireplace.

"
---
These old houses are so draughty
---
where
 that luggage is
---
" Tess, you are not a bit cheerful this evening-- not at all. 
---
as you
 used
---
Those harridans on the panels upstairs have unsettled
 you. 
---
if you really love me,
 after all
---
the words had no serious intent; but.

---
You are worried at not having
 your things
---
why old Jonathan has not come
 with them
---
Why, it is seven o'clock? 
---
A knock had come to the door, and
---
, there being nobody else to answer
 it
---
It is not Jonathan
---
The packet had been brought by a special messenger, who had arrived
 at Talbothays from Emminster Vicarage immediately after the departure
 of the married couple, and. 
---
It was less than a foot long,."


---
It is a little wedding- present for you, Tess
---
" How thoughtful they are!"


---
you open it, dearest
---
" to break those great seals; they look
 so serious. 
---
Inside was a case of morocco leather, on the
 top of which.


---
the diamonds have been locked up
    at my banker's ever since. 
---
it to be a
    somewhat incongruous act in the circumstances
---
as
    you will see
---
they are therefore promptly sent.
   
---
They become, I believe, heirlooms,,
   . 
---
that refers to this matter
   
---
The
    precise words of the clause are enclosed.



---
Unlocking the case, they found.


---
it to contain a necklace, with
 pendant, bracelets, and ear- rings; and also some other small
 ornaments
---
Are they mine
---
" They are, certainly," said he.


---
They gleamed somewhat ironically now. 
---
It was but
---
if that were admitted into one side of the equation
---
it should be

---
a question of vanity throughout; and
 admitted into the other. 
---
" But the gown is n't right, Tess
---
" It ought.
---
the pendant to the necklace hung
---
as it was designed
---
how beautiful you are
---
As everybody knows
---
, fine feathers make fine birds. 
---
that Art can render
---
while the beauty
 of the midnight crush would often cut
---
If you were only
---
in case Jonathan should see me
---
They are not fit for me
---
, are they? 
---
They must be sold
---
them stay a few minutes longer
---
It would be
 a breach of faith."


---
there might be help in these. 
---
they again indulged in conjectures as to where
 Jonathan could possibly be with their baggage. 
---
they had

---
Shortly after this they began supper, which was already laid on
 a side- table. 
---
they had finished
---
there was a jerk in the
 fire- smoke,
---
the rising skein of which bulged out into the room,. 
---
It had

---
been caused by the opening of the outer door. 
---
A heavy step was
---
nobody hear at all by knocking
---
" make," apologized Jonathan
 Kail, and
---
as't was raining out. 
---
But you are very late."


---
There was something subdued in Jonathan Kail's tone which had not
 been there in the day, and
---
We've all been gallied at the dairy at what might ha' been a most
 terrible affliction since you and your Mis'ess----
---
Perhaps you ha'nt forgot the cock's
 afternoon crow?"


---
" Dear me;--what--"

" Well, some says and some another; but
---
it do mane one thing,
---
what's

---
happened is."


---
that poor little Retty Priddle hev tried
---
when you two drove away,
---
as there is not much doing now
---
is-- went out; being
 New Year's Eve, and folks mops and brooms,
 nobody took much notice. 
---
They went on to Lew- Everard, where they
 had summut to drink, and
---
then on they vamped to Dree- armed Cross,
 and
---
there they seemed, and. 
---
where there's another public- house
---
Nothing more was. 
---
a' was
 dead
---
It seems!"


---
if the maids had

---
' a do say' a can guess; and
---
how it
 happened
---
And so you see, sir,."


---
as all this happened
---
just
 when we was packing your few traps and your Mis'ess's night- rail and
 dressing things into the cart
---
, why, it belated me
---
Well, Jonathan, will you get the trunks upstairs, and
---
as you can
---
in case you should be
?"


---
sat down by the fire,

---
Jonathan's footsteps then died
 from the door, and
---
the candles on
 the supper- table being too thin and glimmering to interfere with its
 glow
---
it depress you
---
you know
---
who have cause to
 be, hide it, and pretend they are not
---
;
 they had deserved better at the hands of Fate. 
---
A steady glare from the now flameless embers painted the sides
 and back of the fireplace with its colour, and the well- polished
 andirons, and the old brass tongs that would not meet. 
---
The underside
 of the mantel- shelf was flushed with the high- coloured light, and
 the legs of the table nearest the fire. 
---
Do you remember
---
what we said to each other this morning about
 telling our faults
---
" We spoke lightly perhaps, and
---
you may well
 have done so. 
---
But for me it was no light promise. 
---
You have
---
" You did not expect it? 
---
Ah-- you thought too highly of me. 
---
you to forgive me, and

---
How strange it was! 
---
you agreed
---
it might frighten you away from me
---
, when you
 proposed! 
---
our confessing our faults on the landing-- the sinner that I
 was
---
you sitting there so solemnly
---
if you will forgive me
---
You do n't know.
---
it was a great disappointment to me. 
---
Whatever one
 may think of plenary inspiration
---
, one must heartily subscribe to
 these words of Paul:' Be thou an example-- in word, in conversation,
 in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.' 
---
It is the only
 safeguard for us poor human beings. '
---
Integer vitae_,' says a Roman
 poet, who is strange company for St Paul--


  .



---
" Well, a certain place is paved with good intentions, and."


---
all that so strongly, you will see
---
what a terrible remorse it bred
 in me
---
when, tossed about by doubts and difficulties in London, like a
 cork on the waves
---
Do you forgive me?"


---
" Then we will dismiss it at once and for ever!--too painful as it is
 for the occasion-- and talk of something lighter."


---
-- because now YOU can forgive ME
---
although you smile
---
I said
 so." Perhaps,, it is as serious as yours, or more so."


---
" It can hardly be more serious, dearest."


---
" It cannot-- O
---
no, it can not!
---
" No, it can not be more serious, certainly because' tis
 just the same!
---
Their hands were still joined. 
---
The ashes under the grate were lit
 by the fire vertically, like a torrid waste. 
---
even its re- assertions and secondary
 explanations were done. 
---
; there had been no exculpatory phrase of
 any kind, and
---
But the complexion even of external things seemed. 
---
The fire in the grate
 looked impish-- demoniacally funny,. 
---
The fender grinned idly, as if it too did not
 care. 
---
The light from the water- bottle was merely engaged in a
 chromatic problem. 
---
All material objects around announced their
 irresponsibility with terrible iteration. 
---
And yet nothing had

---
But the essence of things had

---
, the auricular impressions from their previous
 endearments seemed.


---
O you can not be out of your mind! 
---
You ought! 
---
Yet you are
 not... 
---
Why did n't you tell me before
---
Ah, yes, you would have told me, in a
 way-- but"


---
while the depths remained paralyzed
---
that did not
 weep
---
as you are forgiven
---
" You-- yes, you do."


---
" But you do not forgive me?"


---
" O Tess, forgiveness does not apply to the case! 
---
You were one
 person
---
; now you are another. 
---
My God-- how can forgiveness meet such
 a grotesque-- prestidigitation as that!"


---
It kills me quite, that!"
---
what do you mean by that laugh?
---
" Do
 you know?"


---
what this is to me
---
what joy it will be
---
That's!"


---
Angel, that you loved me-- me, my very self! 
---
If it is

---
O how can it be
---
that you look and
---
It
 frightens me! 
---
because you are yourself
---
" You are ill; and
---
it is
 natural."


---
that you should be
---
The image raised caused. 
---
what had
 happened
---
me live with you, Angel
---
we be
 married,
---
while we were in lodgings
---
as I said I would do I sha n't finish the good- hussif'
 I cut out and" Sha n't you?"


---
unless you order me to
---
if you go away
 from me
---
if you never speak to me
---
unless you tell me
---
even if it is
---
" You are very good. 
---
" No, I sha n't do anything,; and if you go away
 from me I shall not follow' ee; and if you never speak to me any more
 I shall not ask why, I may."

" if I order you?"

" I will obey you like your wretched slave,."

 But it strikes me."


---
that there is a want of
 harmony between your present mood of self- sacrifice and your past
 mood of self- preservation
---
These were the first words of antagonism. 
---
Some consequent action was necessary
---
This was what their_ agape_. 
---
At
 tea, two or three hours earlier, they had, in the freakishness of
 affection, drunk from one cup.


---
gently as it had been pulled
 to
---
The rain was over and
---
the night was now clear.


---
The cow and horse tracks in the road were full of water
---
, the rain
 having been enough to charge them, but not enough to wash them away.

---
Across these minute pools the reflected stars flitted in a quick
 transit
---
they were shining
 overhead-- the vastest things of the
 universe
---
to which they had travelled to- day
---
The place was in the same
 valley as Talbothays, but some miles lower down the river; and the
 surroundings being open
---
The cruelty of fooled honesty is often great
 after enlightenment, and
---
when thy face is made bare
---
that loved thee
      
---
;
    Thy face shall be no more fair at the fall of thy fate.
   
---
For thy life shall fall as a leaf and;
   
---
And the veil of thine head shall be grief, and
---
the crown
       shall be pain.



---
"-- what HAVE I done! 
---
You do n't think? 
---
, do you
---
It is in your own mind,
 Angel
---
what you are angry at
---
; it is not in me. 
---
O, it is not in me, and
---
you think me!"


---
me reproach you
---
that would have been
---
things
 better left to silence
---
when it happened
---
You were
---
" Then will you not forgive me?"


---
forgiveness is not all."


---
so!--she knows
 several cases where they were worse than I, and
---
You almost make.

---
me say
---
You do n't know."


---
what you say
---
it went.

"
---
as it came
---
who unearthed your
 pedigree
---
that parson would have done better
---
Decrepit families imply decrepit wills,
 decrepit conduct. 
---
Heaven, why did you give me a handle for despising
 you more by informing me of your descent! 
---
; there were you, the belated seedling of
 an effete aristocracy!"


---
" Lots of families are as bad as mine in that! 
---
so were Dairyman Billett's. 
---
who now are carters
---
And the
 Debbyhouses,, were once the De Bayeux family.

---
You find such as I everywhere
---
They wandered on again in silence. 
---
It was said afterwards
---
who went out late that night for a doctor
---
that a
 cottager of Wellbridge,,
 met two lovers in the pastures,
---
the
 glimpse seemed. 
---
that they
 were anxious and sad
---
During the interval of the cottager's going and
---
The river is down there. 
---
They will not blame you then."


---
It is nonsense
. 
---
which is rather one
 for satirical laughter than for tragedy
---
You do n't in the least
 understand the quality of the mishap. 
---
It would be viewed in the
 light of a joke by nine- tenths of the world.
---
if it were known
---
They had rambled round by a road which led to the well- known ruins of
 the Cistercian abbey behind the mill,
---
the latter having, in centuries
 past, been attached to the monastic establishment. 
---
The mill still
 worked on, food
---
being a perennial necessity; the abbey had perished,
. 
---
creeds being transient
---
One continually sees the ministration of the
 temporary outlasting the ministration of the eternal. 
---
Their walk
 having been circuitous
---
, they were still not far from the house, and

---
, everything remained. 
---
, the fire being
 still burning
---
whither the luggage had been taken
---
its rays fell upon the tester of white dimity
---
In removing the light towards the
 bedstead; something was
, and
---
what it was
---
This was the explanation of that mysterious parcel which it
 had been so difficult to pack and bring;
---
that time would soon show her the purpose
 thereof
---
How
 foolish and inopportune that mistletoe looked now.


---
When sorrow ceases
---
which forbid repose
---
In the candlelight the painting was more than
 unpleasant. 
---
The Caroline bodice of the portrait was low--; and
---
The check was sufficient. 
---
what worlds away
---
Could it be possible?


---
which as they gazed never expressed any divergence from what the
 tongue was telling
---
that eyes
, were yet
---
The night came in, and
---
took up its place there, unconcerned
 and indifferent; the night was now digesting it listlessly; and
---
From above there was no sound; but
---
in a few minutes there came
 a knock at the door. 
---
that it would be the neighbouring
 cottager's wife, who was to minister to their wants while they
 remained here
---
The presence of a third person in the house would be extremely
 awkward just now, and,
---
that they could manage
---
When the dame had gone away
---
There was
 plenty of eggs, butter, bread, and so on in the larder, and
---
The smoke of the kindled wood
 rose from the chimney without like a lotus- headed column
---
who were passing by
---
; local
 people saw it, and thought of the newly- married
 couple, and.


---
" Breakfast is ready!"


---
But it
 soon died.


---
The pair were, in truth, but the ashes of their former fires. 
---
To the
 hot sorrow of the previous night had succeeded heaviness; it seemed
.


---
as if nothing could kindle either of them to fervour of sensation any
 more
---
who had no consciousness
---
though half- dried tears had

---
the life beat.


---
it is not true
---
No, it is not true!"


---
" It is true."


---
it to be one
---
have made of it, by some
 sort of sophistry, a valid denial
---
It is true
---
The baby died
---
My position-- is this
---
it go on to marriage with you
---
that, after all, there was a last way out of it for you
---
you would never--"


---
You CAN get rid of me."


---
" Good heavens-- how can you be so simple! 
---
Ca n't you
---
my confession would give
 you grounds for that
---
O Tess-- you are too, too-- childish-- unformed-- crude
---
what you are
---
You do n't understand the law
---
-- you do n't
 understand!"


---
What-- you can not?
---
Believe me-- believe me, on my soul! 
---
that you could
---
you would not; yet I believed, without a
 doubt,!"


---
that you could cast me off
---
if you were determined, and
---
You were mistaken
---
That's just like me!"


---
What were you thinking of doing
---
if you wo n't be angry with me
---
" It was with the cord of my box. 
---
You must not dare!

---
could you! 
---
how wicked it was
---
The idea was unworthy of you beyond description."


---
you would have
---
However, to
 do it with my own hand is too good for me, after all. 
---
It is you, my
 ruined husband, who ought to strike the blow. 
---
if that were possible
---
, if you could bring yourself,
---
since there's no other way of escape for' ee
---
, since you say. 
---
there was no further rashness
 to be feared.


---
they sat down both on the same side,. 
---
so that
 their glances did not meet
---
There was at first something awkward
 in hearing each other, but
---
this could not be escaped
---
;
 moreover, the amount of eating done was small on both sides.

---
the hour, went off to the miller
---
The charwoman soon came. 
---
you coming over the bridge
---
You must not work like this
---
You are not my servant
---
You mean in name!

---
" You MAY think so, Tess! 
---
You are. 
---
What do you mean?"


---
only you urged me
---
which turned the edge of everything that attempted to
 traverse it
---
who remain sensuously infatuated with what
 they intellectually despise
---
" It is n't a question of respectability, but one of principle!"


---
being still swayed by the antipathetic wave which warps direct souls
 with such persistence when once their vision finds itself mocked by
 appearances
---
There was
---
, it is true, underneath
---
This evening, night, and morning were passed precisely. 
---
as the
 preceding ones had been passed
---
On one, and only one, occasion did
. 
---
You know
---
It was imperative that we
 should stay together a little while, to avoid the scandal to you. 
---
But you must see."


---
it
 is only for form's sake
---
Thus they lived through this despairing day or two; in the same
 house, truly; but more widely apart than before they were lovers. 
---

Besides, that's not all the difficulty

; it lies in
 another consideration-- one bearing upon the future of other people
 than ourselves.

Some might risk the odd

With these natures, corporal

---
Both knew. 
---
that it was in their two minds

that they might part
 the next morning for ever, despite the gloss of assuaging conjectures
 thrown over their proceeding

XXXVII


 Midnight came and.


---
for there was nothing to announce
 it in the Valley of the Froom
---
Not long after one o'clock there was a slight creak in the darkened
 farmhouse once the mansion of the d'Urbervilles. 
---
who used the
 upper chamber
---
It had come from the corner step
 of the staircase, which, as usual, was loosely nailed. 
---
as one would show to a dead body
---
If it had
 by moving or struggling
---
If
 they could only fall together, and.


---
both be dashed to pieces, how fit,
 how desirable
---
they reached the ground- floor safely. 
---
It was under the hovering terror of to- morrow's separation,,
.


---
if that were possible
---
Its waters, in creeping down these miles of meadowland, frequently
 divided,. 
---
that had no name,
---
the river
 was proportionately voluminous and deep. 
---
Across it was a narrow
 foot- bridge; but
---
now the autumn flood had washed the handrail away,

---
which, lying a few inches above the
 speeding current, formed a giddy pathway for even steady heads; and

---
The spot was lonely,
 the river deep and wide enough to make such a purpose easy of
 accomplishment. 
---
; it would be better
 than parting to- morrow to lead severed lives.


---
The swift stream raced and. 
---
Spots of froth travelled
 past, and intercepted weeds waved behind the piles. 
---
they could

---
If both fall together into the current now
---
, their arms would be
---
that they could not be saved
---
so
 tightly clasped together; they would
 go out of the world almost painlessly, and
---
while if they lived
---
this hour would remain.


---
that would have precipitated them both into the gulf
---
Here they were within a plantation which formed the Abbey grounds,
 and
---
till they
 reached the ruined choir of the Abbey- church
---
as if a greatly desired end were attained
---
which had produced the effort

---
The spurt of mental excitement was now over.


---
It was indispensable to do something,. 
---
the sheet being but a poor protection
---
that beatific interval was over.


---
us walk on, darling
---
, which thenceforward
 seemed,.
---
which
 they stood at the manor- house door
---
There was no further difficulty. 
---
that they might
---
as they met the next morning
---
, it stood on a basis approximating to one of pure
 reason,
---
even if initiated by impulse of feeling
---
; that it was so
 far
---
which had made
---
it scorch
 and
---
while they were packing the few remaining articles
---
when reason slept
---
soon after breakfast it arrived
---
The luggage was put on the top, and
---
Beyond this there was nothing in the manner of their leaving to
 suggest a fiasco, or
---
that they were not going together.


---
Their route lay near the dairy
---
from which they had started with such
 solemn joy in each other a few days back, and
---
To make the call as unobtrusive as possible, they left the carriage
 by the wicket leading down from the high road to the dairy- house, and
. 
---
The withy- bed had been
, and
---
far away
 behind the cow- stalls the mead which had been the scene of their
 first embrace. 
---
The gold of the summer picture was now gray,, the rich soil mud, and the river cold.


---
the
 colours mean
---
Over the barton- gate the dairyman saw them, and. 
---
Then Mrs Crick emerged from the house, and
---
they behaved
---
The later had gone
 home to
---
They feared.


---
when they were gone
---
how they
 stood like waxen images and
---
as if they were in a dream
---
Did n't it strike'? 
---
They re-
---
when
 Nuttlebury had been passed, and
---
where there were cross- roads
---
As they
 could not talk with freedom in the driver's presence
---
us understand each other
---
" There is no
 anger between us,. 
---
though there is that which I can not endure at
 present
---
you
 know
---
if it is desirable, possible
---
But it will be better that you should not try to
 come to me."


---
who had done
---
Until you come to me
---
-- if you are ill, or
---
that will
 not be the case
---
; so that it may happen
---
because you know best what my
 punishment ought to be
---
which
 perhaps was a symptom of that reckless acquiescence in chance too
 apparent in the whole d'Urberville family--
---
the many effective
 chords were left untouched
---
The remainder of their discourse was on practical matters only. 
---
The brilliants,
 the interest in which seemed
---
These things arranged
---
The coachman was paid and. 
---
they parted
 there and then.


---
The fly moved creepingly up a hill, and
---
All's WRONG with the world!



---
when such changes were
 made
---
" Marlott is Marlott still. 
---
Folks
 have died and that. 
---
; they was married elsewhere
---
the gentleman being of that
 high standing
---
; well- be- doing
 enough to have any part in it, the bridegroom seeming not to know
 how't have been discovered but.

---
as we call' n now
---
who was
---
" But where's thy gentleman, Tess?"


---
The washing- tub stood in the same old place on the same old
 quarter- hogshead, and"
---
you was married!--married really and

---
we sent the cider--"

" Yes, mother; so I am."


---
When was you married, then? 
---
The day you said?
---
" What's the meaning o' that? '
---
Nation seize such husbands
---
as you seem

---
You said to me, and. 
---
" My good God! that ever
 I should ha' lived, but
---
the tension of so many days having
 relaxed at last
---
if-- it were
---
" Yes, yes; that's! 
---
where my misery do lie
---
if
 you knew
---
if you could only half know
---
what's done
---
now you've made
 this mess of it
---
which had come upon them
 irrespective of desert or folly
---
; as a thing; a chance external impingement to be
 borne with; not a lesson
---
that the beds had been
 shifted, and
---
new arrangements made
---
The hen
 had been carried about this morning.


---
as it was often carried,,,, under the table at Rolliver's for more than an hour
---
though it had lain
---
with its legs
 tied
---
" We've just had up a story.
---
which had arisen at the
 inn about the clergy,
---
though nowadays their true style,
 strictly speaking, is' clerk' only
---
that no
 great publicity should be given to the event
---
that no letter had come,
---
that this was
---
The
 Pure Drop will say to me! 
---
How they'll squint and
---
This is yer mighty match

 level of yer forefathers in King Norman's time

this is too
 much, Joan

" D'ye think.

---
her?--or is it like the first--
---
who had heard as far
---
How unexpected were the attacks of destiny! 
---
that the rupture had adjusted itself under their
 strong feeling that they could not live apart from each other
---
It was three weeks after the marriage. 
---
no
 living person in the twilighted town seemed
---
This is the chief thing: be not perturbed
---
"," said the Pagan moralist.

---
not

---
it be afraid
---
" Let troubled, neither let," said the Nazarene.

---
This was, and
---
As the hours dropped past,
---
Land was offered there on exceptionally advantageous terms. 
---
just
 as the old one had done in the small hours of that morning
---
as the dive of the kingfisher
 stirs a quiet pool
---
" How you
 surprise us!"


---
Why they are all Roman Catholics there surely!"


---
" Are they? 
---
We had three weeks ago
---
that it had taken
 place
---
as you know
---
Of course it was best. 
---
that none of us should be
 present,,
---
especially as you preferred
---
wherever that may be
---
Your bothers felt that very strongly.

---
Now it is done.
---
we do not complain,
---
you must suppose
 it. 
---
Angel, there is no irritation in my mind or your
 father's against you for this marriage; but
---
we have thought it much
 better.

---
It seems strange. 
---
What has
 happened?"


---
that it had been thought best by them
---
But this idea of Brazil is quite a recent
 one. 
---
it will be unadvisable. 
---
before you start
---
it would be possible
.


---
A hastily prepared supper was brought in, and
---
that a good thing could come out of Nazareth-- a charming
 woman out of Talbothays Dairy
---
Of that there can be no question
---
You said the other day; roundly built; had deep red lips like Cupid's bow;
 dark eyelashes and brows, an immense rope of hair like a ship's
 cable; and large eyes violety- bluey- blackish."


---
since my son is
---
when the time came for the
 chapter from the Bible which was always read before evening prayers
---
,
 the Vicar observed to Mrs Clare--


---
, that it will be more appropriate
---
which we should
 have had in the usual course of our reading
---
We shall not need. 
---
The portable lectern was taken out
 from the corner and
---
, the two old
 servants came in, and
---
while it is yet night
---
Many daughters have done
    virtuously, but
---
that chapter applied
---
you see
---
Many daughters
 have done virtuously, but
---
who knew
 neither the world, the flesh, nor the devil in their own hearts, only
 as something vague and external to themselves
---
" is there something wrong that you go away so
 soon
---
it is
---
Have you quarrelled in these three weeks?"


---
We have not exactly quarrelled
---
" But we have had a
 difference--
---
whose history will bear investigation?"


---
After all, there are few purer things in
 nature then an unsullied country maid.
---
which
 may offend your more educated sense at first
---
Any crudeness of manner, will,
 disappear under the influence or your companionship and tuition."


---
that it was made, and
---
that it abhorred
---
Moreover, the figure near at hand
 suffers on such occasion,
---
because it shows up its sorriness without
 shade
---
while vague figures afar off are honoured
---
;, in that their
 distance makes artistic virtues of their stains.

At breakfast Brazil was the topic, and.

---
all endeavoured notwithstanding the discouraging reports of some farm- labourers who
 had emigrated thither and
---
which
 produced heartache in others
---
what
 an excellent and promising scheme it seemed
---
" Yes; it is a likely scheme enough in a commercial sense, no doubt,"

---
But, my dear Mercy, it snaps the continuity of
 existence. 
---
Perhaps a cloister would be preferable."


---
"

" Why, you wicked man, a cloister implies a monk, and a monk Roman
 Catholicism."


---
thrown by sheer misery into one of the demoniacal moods

---
" you must forgive me
---
thus the interview ended, and. 
---
what had
 really happened
---
As the last duty before leaving this part of England it was necessary

---
the trifle of rent
 having to be paid, the key given up of the rooms they had occupied,
 and
---
two or three small articles fetched away
---
that they had left
 behind
---
It was under this roof. 
---
Yet unlocked the door of the sitting- room and looked into it, the memory
 was that of their happy arrival on a
 similar afternoon, the first fresh sense of sharing a habitation
 conjointly, the first meal together, the chatting by the fire with
 joined hands.


---
The bed
 was smooth. 
---
The mistletoe hung under the tester. 
---
it was turning colour, and

---
the leaves and berries were. 
---
you had
---
if ye be well
---
you might be back here again
---
" we are not living here now
---
Which way are you going home, Izz?
---
" Why is that?"


---
" It was so dismal there that I left! 
---
the direction journeying
---
Well-- are you going there now? 
---
if you
 wish for a lift
---
which had
---
to be considered by reason of the
 sudden abandonment of the lodgings
---
as they drove on
---
what life there is like
---
They sped along eastward for some considerable distance,.


---
are the others
---
The dairyman has got."


---
" How is that? 
---
Do you remember?"


---
how neatly you used' Twas
 down in Cupid's Gardens' and' The Tailor's Breeches' at morning
 milking
---
When you first came,
---
sir, that was. 
---
Not when you had been
 there a bit.
---
If you had
---
did you
 never guess it till now!"


---
By- and- by they reached a branch road to a village.


---
there was no legitimate pathway. 
---
-- will you go with me
 instead of her?"


---
" You truly wish?"


---
me to go
---
And you at
 least love me disinterestedly."


---
" You will? 
---
You know, Izz?"


---
what it means
---
" It means--"


---
that's good enough for me.
---
" Remember, you are. 
---
that it will be wrong
---
to remind you- doing in the eyes of
 civilization-- Western civilization, that is."


---
when it comes to agony- point, and

---
there's no other way!"


---
where you are
---
" How's that?"


---
as if a sob had solidified there
---
" Do you regret that poor little act of justice to an absent one?

---
You have!"


---
They reached the corner of the lane which they had passed half an
 hour earlier, and
---
" It was

---
O, it was no levity to me!"


---
that was inexpressible
---
Well, but, Izz, we'll part friends, anyhow? 
---
You do n't know!"


---
you have hitherto been; and
---
" Heaven bless and. 
---
it was with a strained unnatural face. 
---
Nobody ever was told
.


---
And the momentum of the course tended. 
---
unless diverted by
 a stronger, more sustained force
---
We discover the latter in changed conditions
---
which others bore
---
The dairy- work lasted,, but
. 
---
only till the milk began
---
as harvest was now

---
this continued.


---
till harvest
 was done
---
them go
---
to have had
 to disperse them was like giving away relics. 
---
that they
 were in dreadful difficulty
---
; the autumn rains had gone through the
 thatch of the house, which required entire renewal; but
---
this could
 not be done.

---
because the previous thatching had never been paid for
---
New rafters and a new ceiling upstairs also were required,. 
---
which,
 with the previous bill, would amount to a sum of twenty pounds
---
the case being so deplorable,
---
as the sum was

---
When the last pound
 had gone
---
, whatever it may be

---
The consequence was.


---
which was
---
it mattered little,. 
---
if it were
 true
---
Even were they

---
it would be passing mean.


---
which was not essentially
---
having been drenched with thunder- storms and
 in common with all the English farmers
 and farm- labourers who, just at this time, were deluded into going
 thither by the promises of the Brazilian Government, and by the
 baseless assumption that those frames which, ploughing and sowing on
 English uplands, had resisted all the weathers to whose moods they
 had been born, could resist equally well all the weathers by which
 they were surprised on Brazilian plains
---
persecuted by other hardships,
---
Thus it happened
---
Society might be better. 
---
The small dairies to the west, beyond Port- Bredy, the spring and summer
 required no further aid. 
---
The anti- climax
 would be too intolerable; and
---
which had

---
where there was room for other hands
---
if it was really true

---
Whilst the clothes lasted
---
nothing occurred
---
The lane was long and unvaried, and,
---
which the lane stretched its serpentine length
 in glimpses
---
though the
 landscape was nearly dark
---
Why, surely, it is the young wench who was at Trantridge awhile--

---
that was
 true,? 
---
You

Under foot the leaves were dry, and
---
which grew among the deciduous trees
---
the foliage of some holly bushes
 was dense enough to keep off
 draughts. 
---
Such sleep was naturally fitful
---
that they were caused by the
 breeze
---
Was there
 another such a wretched being as she in the world? 
---
" All is vanity
---
that this
 was a most inadequate thought for modern days
---
If all
 were only vanity, who would mind it? 
---
All was, alas, worse than
 vanity-- injustice, punishment, exaction, death. 
---
so that a time would come
---
when that bone would be bare
---
it were now
---
It might be the wind; yet
---
there was scarcely any
 wind. 
---
Sometimes it was a palpitation, sometimes a flutter
---
; sometimes
 it was a sort of gasp or gurgle. 
---
that the
 noises came from wild creatures of some kind, the more so
---
when,
 originating in the boughs overhead, they were followed by the fall
 of a heavy body upon the ground
---
Day at length broke in the sky. 
---
When it had been day aloft for some
.


---
little while it became day in the wood
---
Directly the assuring and prosaic light of the world's active hours
 had grown strong
---
what had been going on
---
The plantation ran down
 at this spot into a peak, which ended it hitherward, outside the
 hedge. 
---
Under the trees several pheasants lay
 about, their rich plumage
---
some were dead
---
dabbled with blood;, some
 feebly twitching a wing
---
, some staring up at the sky, some pulsating
 quickly, some contorted, some stretched out--, except the fortunate ones whose tortures had ended during the
 night by the inability of nature to bear more.


---
all of them writhing in
 agony
---
The birds had been driven
 down into this corner the day before by some shooting- party; and
,
---
that had dropped dead under the shot, or
---
while those had died before
 nightfall
---
had been searched for and carried off, many badly wounded
 birds had escaped and.


---
where they had maintained their position
---
till they grew
 weaker with loss of blood in the night- time,
---
that, rough and brutal as they seemed just then
---
, they
 were not like this all the year round, but
---
, quite civil
 persons save during certain weeks of autumn and winter,, and
---
when, like
 the inhabitants of the Malay Peninsula, they ran amuck
---
the game- keepers should come
---
as they
 probably would come--
---
Poor darlings-- to suppose!
---
myself the most miserable being on earth
 in the sight o' such misery as yours
---
which had no
 foundation in Nature
---
It was now broad day, and
---
But there was no need for caution
---
; not a soul was at
 hand, and
---
was it not possible
---
that was
---
'em think scornfully of me
---
Every thread of that old attire
 has become faded and thin under the stroke of raindrops, the burn of
 sunbeams, and the stress of winds. 
---
Inside this exterior, over which the eye might have roved
---
as over a
 thing scarcely percipient, almost inorganic, there was the record of
 a pulsing life which had learnt too well, for its years, of the dust
 and ashes of things, of the cruelty of lust and the fragility of
 love.


---
Next day the weather was bad, but
---
, there was no time to lose. 
---
its rumoured stringencies being the reverse of
 tempting
---
as acceptance in any variety of these grew hopeless,
---
if Cybele the
 Many- breasted were supinely extended there
---
Here the air was dry and cold, and
---
the long cart- roads were blown
 white and dusty within a few hours after rain. 
---
There were few trees,
 or none, those that would have grown in the hedges being mercilessly
 plashed down with the quickset by the tenant- farmers, the natural
 enemies of tree, bush, and brake. 
---
they seemed friendly. 
---
They had a low and unassuming aspect from
 this upland,
---
it was
 the English Channel at a point far out towards France
---
There seemed. 
---
it was
 time to rest from searching, and
---
particularly
 as it began
---
Who would think
---
the heat of
 which came through the bricks
---
The wall seemed.

---
the rattle of
 their supper- plates was also audible. 
---
The solitude was at,. 
---
last broken by the
 approach of one feminine figure
---
though the evening was cold
---
who,,
 wore the print gown and the tilt- bonnet of summer time
---
And is it really so bad
 as this, my child? 
---
is your cwomely face
---
Anybody been beating' ee? 
---
" You've lost it travelling."


---
The truth is,."


---
" And you do n't wear your wedding- ring?"


---
people to think
---
married at all; it would be so awkward."


---
it seems hardly fair!"


---
that you
 should live like this
---
" O yes it is, quite fair
---
you can be unhappy!"


---
" Wives are unhappy sometimes; from no fault of their husbands-- from
 their own."


---
You've no faults, deary
---
So it
 must be something outside ye both."


---
" Marian, dear Marian, will you do me a good turn without asking
 questions? 
---
Do they want a hand
 here?"


---
" O yes; they'll take one always,. '
---
because few care to come
---
Corn and swedes are all they grow. 
---
But you used
---
Lord, that's
 the only comfort I've got now! 
---
If you engage
---
, you'll be set
 swede- hacking. 
---
That's; but
---
you wo n't like it."


---
Will you speak for me?"


---
" You will do better by speaking for yourself."


---
This is pay- night
---
if you were
---
to come with me you
 would know at once
---
that you are not happy
---
You could n't be unhappy."


---
That's true
---
"

 They walked on together and.
---
which was
 almost sublime in its dreariness
---
There was not a tree within sight
---
;
 there was not, at this season, a green pasture-- nothing but fallow
 and turnips everywhere, in large fields divided by hedges plashed to
 unrelieved levels.


---
till the group of
 workfolk had received their wages, and
---
, it appeared,
---
The farmer himself was not at home, but
---
Female field- labour was

it would afford a shelter for the winter
 at any rate.

Of the three classes of

 itself, and,.

the village uncared for either by itself or by its lord
( in other words, the village of a resident squires's tenantry, the
 village of free- or copy- holders, and the absentee- owner's village,
 farmed with the land) this place, Flintcomb- Ash
---
The swede- field hacking was
 a stretch of a hundred odd acres in one patch, on the highest ground
 of the farm,. 
---
The upper half
 of each turnip had been eaten off by the live- stock, and
---
that it might be eaten also
---
the vegetable having already been consumed
---
Every leaf of, the whole
 field was in colour a desolate drab
---
; it was a complexion without
 features,. 
---
The sky wore, in another colour, the same likeness
---
; a white
 vacuity of countenance with the lineaments gone. 
---
So these two upper
 and nether visages confronted each other all day long.


---
, the white face
 looking down on the brown face, and without anything standing between them but the two girls
 crawling over the surface of the former like flies
---
the brown face looking up at the
 white face,
---
Nobody came near them, and
---
their movements showed a mechanical
 regularity
---
; their forms standing enshrouded in Hessian"
---
scant skirts revealing boots that reached
 high up the ankles, and yellow sheepskin gloves with gauntlets
---
The
 pensive character which the curtained hood lent to their bent heads
 would have reminded the observer of some early Italian conception of
 the two Marys.


---
They worked on hour after hour, unconscious of the forlorn aspect
 they bore in the landscape. 
---
Even in such a position as theirs it was possible
. 
---
In the afternoon the rain came on again, and

---
that they need
---
they would not be paid
---
But if they did not
 work; so they worked on. 
---
It was so high a
 situation, this field,. 
---
that the rain had no occasion to fall, but

---
till they were wet through
---
There are degrees of
 dampness, and
---
a very little is called. 
---
that the sun is down
---
Yet they did not feel the wetness so much. 
---
They
 were both young, and
---
And thus, as has been said, though
 the damp curtains of their bonnets flapped smartly into their faces,
 and
---
their wrappers clung about them to wearisomeness
---
, they lived all
 this afternoon in memories of green, sunny, romantic Talbothays.


---
" You can see a gleam of a hill within a few miles o' Froom Valley
 from here
---
Can you?
---
So the two forces were at work here. 
---
as everywhere, the inherent will
 to enjoy, and the circumstantial will against enjoyment
---
You see
---
: you did n't; and."


---
you can do
 without it perhaps
---
When it was not swede
---
- grubbing it was

---
in which process they sliced off the earth and the
 fibres with a bill- hook before storing the roots for future use. 
---
At
 this occupation they could shelter themselves by a thatched hurdle; but
---
if
 it rained
---
if it was frosty
---
even their thick leather gloves could
 not prevent the frozen masses they handled from biting their fingers.

---
the queer- shaped
 flints aforesaid, and shriek with laughter
---
They often looked across the country to where the Var or
 Froom was.

"
---
even though they might not be able to see
 it
---
they had spent out there
---
it all come back a'most
---
as the
 visions returned
---
the next was two or three days
 later,.


---
There had not been such a winter for years. 
---
It came on in stealthy
 and measured glides, like the moves of a chess- player. 
---
One morning
 the few lonely trees and the thorns of the hedgerows appeared. 
---
as if
 they had put off a vegetable for an animal integument
---
Every twig
 was covered with a white nap as of fur; the whole bush or
 tree forming a staring sketch in white lines on the mournful gray
 of the sky and horizon. 
---
Cobwebs revealed their presence on sheds
 and walls where none had ever been observed till brought out into
 visibility by the crystallizing atmosphere, hanging like loops of
 white worsted from salient points of the out- houses, posts, and
 gates.


---
After this season of congealed dampness came a spell of dry frost,

---
when strange birds from behind the North Pole began
---
to arrive
 silently on the upland of Flintcomb- Ash; gaunt spectral creatures
 with tragical eyes-- eyes; been half blinded
 by the whirl of colossal storms and terraqueous distortions; and
.

---
that such scenes had engendered
---
of
 all they had seen
---
which humanity would never see
---
, they brought no
 account. 
---
The traveller's ambition to tell was not theirs, and, with
 dumb impassivity
---
that these visitants relished as
 food
---
Then one day a peculiar quality invaded the air of this open country.

---
There came a moisture which was not of rain, and a cold which was not
 of frost. 
---
It chilled the eyeballs of the twain,. 
---
They knew, and
---
that it meant snow
---
in the
 night the snow came. 
---
who continued,
---
that cheered any lonely pedestrian who paused beside
 it
---
which
 seemed
---
that the roof had turned itself into a gymnasium
 of all the winds
---
that the snow had blown through a chink in the casement,
, and
---
so that it lay sole- deep upon the floor
---
Without, the
 storm drove so fast as to create a snow- mist in the kitchen; but.


---
as
 yet it was too dark out- of- doors
---
that it was impossible;
---
that they were
---
till the weather changed
---
as the uniform cloak of darkness without began
---
As soon,
 therefore, to turn
 to a disordered medley of grays, they blew out the lamp,.

---
their woollen cravats
 round their necks and across their chests,
---
The snow had followed the birds from the polar basin as a white
 pillar of a cloud, and
---
individual flakes could not be seen. 
---
The
 blast smelt of icebergs, arctic seas, whales, and white bears,
 carrying the snow so that it licked the land but. 
---
They trudged onwards with slanted bodies through the flossy
 fields,. 
---
as they could
---
which, however, acted as strainers rather than screens
---
that infested it
---
; such
 weather on a dry upland is not in itself.


---
the cunning northern birds knew
---
this was coming
---
" Depend upon't, they keep just in front o't all the way from
 the North Star. 
---
Not that this weather hurts your beauty at all--."


---
in
 fact, it rather does it good
---
" Well, but-- surely you care for'n! 
---
Do you?"


---
you do
---
But' pon my body, it is a rum life for
 a married couple! 
---
There-- I wo n't say another word! 
---
Well, as for
 the weather, it wo n't hurt us in the wheat- barn; but
---
reed- drawing is
 fearful hard work-- worse than swede- hacking. 
---
you be slimmer than I. 
---
why maister
 should have set' ee at it
---
They reached the wheat- barn and. 
---
One end of the long
 structure was full of corn
---
; the middle was and
---
where the reed- drawing was

---
as many sheaves of wheat as would be sufficient
---
Izz it was, and
---
, however, just before
 the snow began, and. 
---
for they had been under the influence of
 liquor on that occasion
---
Noted reed- drawers were they too, and.


---
Putting on their gloves, all set an erection formed of two posts connected by a cross- beam,
 under which the sheaves to be drawn from were laid ears outward
---
, the
 beam being pegged down by pins in the uprights, and.


---
as the
 sheaves diminished
---
, the light coming in at the barndoors
 upwards from the snow instead of downwards from the sky
---
who were recounting scandals
---
Presently they heard the muffled tread of a horse, and
---
the farmer
 rode up to the barndoor. 
---
you might be as soon as I
 heard of your being hired
---
Well, you thought and the second
 time on the road, when you bolted; but
---
You thought
---
But there's nothing
 like a winter afield for taking that nonsense out o' young wenches'
 heads; and. 
---
you've signed and
---
Now, are you
 going?"


---
you ought
---
as you like
---
But we'll see. 
---
which is master here
---
Be
 they all the sheaves you've done to- day?"

" Yes, sir."


---
what they've done over there"
()
---
" The rest, too, have done
 better than you."


---
" They've all practised it before, and
---
it
 made no difference to you
---
as it is task work,
---
we are only paid
 for what we do."


---
" Oh, but it does. 
---
the barn cleared
---
the others will do."


---
anything was better than
 gallantry. 
---
When two o'clock arrived the professional reed- drawers

---
which still fell
---
Now,
 we've got it all to ourselves
---
; you
 will see
---
" Ah-- that's owing to an accident-- a misunderstanding; and
---
we wo n't
 argue it
---
After this they continued for some long time in a reverie,. 
---
as they
 went on seizing the ears of corn,
---
you would n't be able to stand it
---
" It wants
 harder flesh than yours for this work."


---
Just then the farmer entered. 
---
Oh, that's
---
how you get on
---
" But it is my own loss
---
it finished
---
Now you go and."


---
you do that
---
after the straight
 straw had been drawn--
---
the rustle of
 the straw and the cutting of the ears by the others had the weight of
 bodily touches.


---
the subject already broached,
---
It was. 
---
its curves
 straightened. "
---
" No.  It is a very good thing that you have done! 
---
what it may lead
 to
---
The dim light in the barn grew dimmer, and
---
they could see. 
---
Was it? 
---
; Sunday was
 the only possible opportunity. 
---
Flintcomb- Ash being in the middle
 of the cretaceous tableland
---
over which no railway had climbed as
 yet
---
, it would be necessary. 
---
And the distance being fifteen
 miles each way
---
when the snow had gone, and
---
had been followed by
 a hard black frost
---
The weather was still
 favourable,.


---
Their lodgings were in a cottage
 a little further along the lane, but
---
they came and
---
-- you do look
 a real beauty!"
---
With a final tug and touch here, and a slight brush there, they let
; and.

---
Instead of the colourless air of the uplands, the
 atmosphere down there was a deep blue. 
---
Here the landscape was whitey- brown; down there,
---
as in
 Froom Valley, it was always green. 
---
Yet it was in that vale. 
---
who have felt
---
what
 the thing symbolized
---
where
 the stone pillar stands desolate and silent
---
Cross- in- Hand,, to mark the site of a
 miracle, or murder, or both
---
The shrubs on the Vicarage lawn rustled uncomfortably
 in the frosty breeze
---
that the house was
 the residence of near relations
---
: in pains, pleasures, thoughts,
 birth, death, and after- death, they were the same.


---
The thing was done
---
; there could be no retreat. 
---
No;
 the thing was not done. 
---
The effort
 had and. 
---
The
 wind was so nipping
---
that the ivy- leaves had become wizened and gray
---
A piece of blood- stained paper, caught up from some
 meat- buyer's dust- heap, beat up and down the road without the gate;
 too flimsy to rest, too heavy to fly away; and
---
a few straws kept it
 company.


---
The second peal had been louder, and
---
still nobody came. 
---
And
 as if inclined to
 return, it was. 
---
with a breath of relied
---
orders been given
---
Ah-- the explanation was every one. 
---
that they were all at church,
---
, servants included,. 
---
when they came home
---
It was,
 therefore, only necessary. 
---
till the service was over
---
But the people began, and
---
small country- townsfolk walking home at its leisure
---
it might be convenient.

---
As they drew nearer
---
more
 briskly they walked
---
They were plainly
 bent upon taking a short quick stroll before going indoors to lunch
 or dinner, to restore warmth to limbs chilled with sitting through a
 long service.


---
They said nothing, however,
.

---
one of them remarked,"
---
There is Mercy Chant
---
It is a queer business, apparently. 
---
The young lady still further ahead heard their
 footsteps and. 
---
Then there was a greeting and a shaking of
 hands, and the three went on together.


---
They soon reached the summit of the hill, and,.

---
Here's a pair of old boots
---
who wished
---
" Some imposter to come into the town barefoot, perhaps,
 and so excite our sympathies," said Miss Chant. 
---
Yes, it must have

---
for they are excellent walking- boots--
---
who had been the one to find them
---
who had heard this
---
Thereupon our heroine resumed. 
---
that it was all sentiment
---
which had caused
---
It was impossible to think of returning to the Vicarage.

---
as the slight had been inflicted
---
how hopeless life was for their
 owner
---
THEY did n't know

---
to save these
 pretty ones no-- they did not know it
---
And they
 did n't think
---
If they had known
---
perhaps they would not have cared,
!"


---
whose conventional standard of
 judgement had caused her all these latter sorrows
---
Their hearts went out of them at a bound towards extreme
 cases,. 
---
when the subtle mental troubles of the less desperate among
 mankind failed
---
In jumping at
 Publicans and Sinners they would forget; and
---
that a word might be said for
 the worries of Scribes and Pharisees
---
this defect or limitation
 might have recommended their own daughter- in- law to them at this
 moment as a fairly choice sort of lost person for their love.


---
No crisis, apparently, had supervened;
 and
---
the world see

---
But it was done with a sorry shake of the head.
---
It is
 nothing
---
"-- it is nothing!
---
Nobody loves it
---
"; nobody sees it.

---
Who cares about the looks of a castaway like me!"


---
It had no
 sprightliness, no purpose; only a tendency. 
---
paused by milestones
---
The cottage by the church,, was almost the first at that end of the village, and
.


---
that the place seemed quite deserted
---
The people are gone to afternoon service
---
hain't strook out yet
---
They be all gone. 
---
A ranter preaches there between the services-- an
 excellent, fiery, Christian man
---
, they say. 
---
What comes in the regular way over the pulpit
---
But, Lord, I do n't go to
 hear'n!  is hot enough
 for I."


---
The sermon, as might be expected, was of the extremest
 antinomian type
---
This fixed idea of the rhapsodist was delivered
 with animated enthusiasm, in a manner entirely declamatory,. 
---
what the text had been from
 its constant iteration--


   
---
when the speaker
 began
---
But a day of awakening had come, and,
---
in a human sense, it had been
.


---
The low winter sun
 beamed directly upon the great double- doored entrance on this side
---
one of the doors being open
---
all snugly
 sheltered from the northern breeze. 
---
who stood upon some sacks of corn,

---
The rencounter came at a heavy moment,. 
---
one of all moments calculated

---
But such was
.


---
what emanated from that countenance
---
There was the same handsome unpleasantness
 of mien, but
---
the
 sable moustache having disappeared; and
---
It was less a reform than a transfiguration. 
---
The former curves of
 sensuousness were now modulated to lines of devotional passion.

---
that had meant seductiveness
---
The lip- shapes were now made
---
the glow on the cheek that yesterday could be
 translated
---
as riotousness was evangelized to- day into the splendour
 of pious rhetoric
---
The lineaments, as such, seemed. 
---
They had been diverted
 from their hereditary connotation
---
for which
 Nature did not intend them. 
---
that their very elevation was a
 misapplication,
---
Yet could it be so? 
---
It was but
---
which had

---
The
 greater the sinner, the greater the saint; it was not necessary.


---
that lay upon it
---
This paralysis lasted, however,
 but a short time
---
And, as in the
 legend, it had resulted.


---
whereby the fire of the priest had been well nigh
 extinguished
---
; now there was a change in
 the quality of its trouble. 
---
Bygones would never be
 complete bygones.


---
Its dry pale surface stretched severely onward, unbroken by a single
 figure, vehicle, or mark
---
which dotted its cold aridity here and there
---
There was not much time, however, for thought or elusion, and
---
" It is I-- Alec d'Urberville."


---
it is
---
Of course,"," there is something of the ridiculous to your
 eyes in seeing me like this. 
---
you had gone away
---
; nobody knew where. 
---
Tess, you wonder?"


---
that you had not, with all my heart
---
" Yes-- you may well say it
---
as they moved onward
 together, she with unwilling tread
---
because you may have been led
---
if you did

---
-- how your sudden appearance unnerved me down there
---
It was
 but a momentary faltering; and
---
what you have been to me
---
,
 it was natural enough. 
---
though perhaps
 you think me a humbug for saying it-- and
---
that of all persons in the world whom it was my duty and desire
 to save from the wrath to come
---
if you like
---
you saved yourself
---
Charity begins at home
---
, they say."


---
" Heaven,, has done all. 
---
that
 you can pour upon me
---
No amount of contempt, Tess, will equal-- the old Adam of my former years! 
---
Well, it is a strange
 story
---
you will be interested
 enough at least to listen
---
, the younger of whom are gradually attenuating the
 true doctrines by their sophistries, but the shadow of
 what they were
---
till they are
---
who came to scoff
---
that those
 sometimes remained
---
They sank into my mind. 
---
Since then my one desire has been and
---
that is;. 
---
though it is only lately
 that I have preached hereabout
---
The first months of my ministry have
 been spent in the North of England among strangers,,. 
---
who have known one
---
If you could only know
---
then it is a fine thing, when you have had enough of
 that,! 
---
It came to me like a jolly new
 idea! 
---
And you do n't believe me? 
---
What do n't you believe?"


---
than you does not
 believe in such
---
God forbid-- and
---
you know
---
newcomers see furthest sometimes.
---
as you feel, Alec
---
it was
---
since you wear a veil
---
But to hide
 your good looks, why do n't you keep it down?"


---
It was mostly
---
It may seem harsh of me
---
" to dictate like this,";" but
 it is better. 
---
It might be
 dangerous."


---
for me
 not to fear them
---
An evangelist has nothing to do with!"


---
such as they;
 and it reminds me of the old times
---
After this their conversation dwindled to a casual remark now and

---
then as they rambled onward
---
when they came to a gate or stile
---
Frequently they found
---
who had been at the pains
---
others, to paint these
 reminders
---
that no means might be left untried
---
which might move the
 hearts of a wicked generation
---
that I would forget At length the road touched the spot called" Cross- in- Hand." 
---
Of all
 spots on the bleached and desolate upland this was the most forlorn.

---
It was so far removed from the charm which is sought in landscape by
 artists and view- lovers as to reach a new kind of beauty, a negative
 beauty of tragic tone. 
---
The place took its name from a stone pillar
 which stood there, a strange rude monolith, from a stratum unknown
 in any local quarry.

---
Differing accounts were given of its history and purport. 
---
Some
 authorities stated; others that the stone as it stood was entire, and that it had
 been fixed there to mark a boundary or place of meeting. 
---
that a devotional cross had once formed the
 complete erection thereon, of which the present relic was but the
 stump
---
Anyhow,
 whatever the origin of the relic, there was and.


---
amid which it
 stands
---
as they drew near to
 this spot
---
my way lies across to the right from here. 
---
And you upset me
 somewhat too, Tessy. 
---
How is it? 
---
that you speak so fluently now
---
Who has
 taught you such good English?"


---
" What troubles have you had?"


---
" Why did n't you write to me?"


---
when you felt your
 trouble coming on
---
But before we part come here." 
---
" This was once a Holy Cross.
---
Relics are not in my creed; but
."


---
that
 you will never tempt me-- by your charms or ways
---
" Good God-- how can you ask!  All that is
 furthest from my thought!"


---
what is so unnecessary
---
you are not a believer
---
" that some
 unbeliever should have got hold of you and. 
---
who knows
---
what may not happen
---
as if instigated by a former thought
---
It was dated several months before
 this time, and.


---
to do this on account
 of the delay it would have entailed
---
" What is the meaning of that old stone I have passed?
---
Was it ever a Holy Cross?"


---
" Cross-- no;' twer not a cross! ' Tis a thing of ill- omen,.

---
The bones lie underneath. 
---
They say."


---
The dry winter wind still blew, but
---
On the sheltered side was a turnip- slicing machine
---
, whose bright blue
 hue of new paint seemed almost vocal in the otherwise subdued scene.

---
in which the roots
 had been preserved since early winter
---
from its trough
 came the newly- cut swedes,.


---
where
 the swedes had been pulled
---
The wide acreage of blank agricultural brownness, apparent, was beginning. 
---
Along the edge of
 each of these something crept upon ten legs,
---
moving without haste
 and without rest up and down the whole length of the field; it was
 two horses and a man.


---
, the plough going between them,
---
For hours nothing relieved the joyless monotony of things.
---
Then, far
 beyond the ploughing- teams, a black speck was seen. 
---
It had come from
 the corner of a fence, where there was a gap, and
---
its tendency was
 up the incline, towards the swede- cutters. 
---
From the proportions of
 a mere point it advanced to the shape of a ninepin, and
---
who was occupied
---
the presence of the
 grinder seemed. 
---
You have refused my last request,!
---
" It is more serious than you may think."


---
It is this
---
when we last met
---
You were, and
---
that it is hard--
---
harder than it
 used
---
Perhaps a good
 deal of it is owning to me!"


---
the very
 worst case concerned in! 
---
till you told me
---
The whole blame was mine-- the whole unconventional business
 of our time at Trantridge. 
---
you were as to
 possibilities! 
---
in all earnestness that it is a shame
---
that the wicked may set for them,
---
whether their motive
 be a good one or the result of simple indifference
---
" But it is not
---
" My
 circumstances are these. 
---
since you were at
 Trantridge, and
---
the place is my own. 
---
However, to ask
 you is, will you put it in my power to do my duty--... 
---
" What is it?"
---
" You will not? 
---
Why is that?"


---
; duty and desire ran hand- in- hand.

"
---
who turned the slicer
---
that the argument could not be ended there
---
that a gentleman had come,
---
You will not marry me, Tess, and?
---
You know
---
" But you would get?"


---
as you
 really could forgive me
---
The words seemed.


---
You do
---
what is
 morally right and proper
---
which you will overcome--"


---
" It is a
 secret here, or at any rate
---
will you
---
So will you, PLEASE
, keep from questioning me? 
---
You must remember."


---
that we are
 now strangers
---
" Strangers-- are we?  Strangers!"


---
who turned the machine
---
" Angels of
 heaven!--God forgive me for such an expression--
---
There never were such eyes, surely, before
 Christianity or since! 
---
that the sight of you had waked up my love for you,
---
which,, was extinguished with all such feelings
---
that our marriage might be a sanctification for us both
---
" But I only asked for your sake!"" Angels of
 heaven!--God forgive me for such an expression-- I came here, I swear,
 as I thought for your good.  so-- I can not
 stand your looks!  There-- I wo n't lose my head; I dare not.
 I own I
 believed.  But I thought
. '' I said to myself But my plan
 is dashed from me; and"


---
that being so
---
that being prevented
---
There are many questions
 that I am tempted to ask, but
---
It was through you! 
---
"

" Ah, is it so!... 
---
That's sad, Tess!"


---
It is by
 my own arrangement."


---
" I-- I can not tell you.  There are things which are private to
 ourselves."


---
" Of course that means. 
---
" You must not-- you must not!
---
" O,
 will you go away-- for the sake of me and my husband--, in the name
 of your own Christianity!"


---
Tess, as
 God is my judge
---
which they had not
 noticed in their preoccupation
---
A pattering of hoofs on the soil of the field,, ceased close behind them; and
---
" What the devil are you doing away from your work at this time o'
 day
---
Farmer Groby had espied the two figures from the distance, and.


---
that was not Christianity
---
what mid Methodist pa'sons have?"


---
Who is the fellow
---
that sort of attack being
 independent of sex
---
which had just taken place
---
If so be you make an agreement to work for me
---
that you carry it out
---
what might have been the
 result
---
who had been in a position to read between the lines
---
Any one would
 have seen. 
---
which
 were not disclosed
---
which was of great import to agriculturists-- the
 day of the Candlemas Fair
---
It was at this fair
---
that new engagements
 were entered into for the twelve months following the ensuing
 Lady- Day, and
---
who thought of changing
 their places
---
those of the farming population duly attended at the county- town. 
---
where the fair was

---
Nearly all the labourers on Flintcomb- Ash farm intended
 flight, and
---
early in the morning there was a general exodus in the
 direction of the town, which lay at a distance of from ten to a dozen
 miles over hilly country. 
---
It was a peaceful February day, of wonderful softness for the time,
 and
---
one would almost have thought. 
---
that winter was over
---
They seemed. 
---
the doer
 was ashamed
---
as
 there was no sense in that either
---
how you are
---
It is hard;
---
yet so it is. 
---
If you would only
 pray for me, Tess!"


---
who moves the world
---
" You really think that?
---
How strange it seems! 
---
you hinted something of the sort the other day
---
What do you really
 believe in these matters, Tess?
---
" You seem."


---
Then do you think?"


---
that the line is all wrong
---
The fact is
---
you accept
---
you reject
---
That's just like you
 women. 
---
" Yes, but you should not take negative opinions wholesale from
 another person like that. 
---
who had n't looked into doctrines at all
---
" What used? 
---
as it occasionally happened
---
who had listened with the
 greatest attention
---
which might possibly have been paralleled in many a work of the
 pedigree ranging from the_ Dictionnaire Philosophique_ to Huxley's

---
How do you remember them?"


---
it is right
---
what you do n't know
 yourself
---
it to be different
---
is good
 enough for me."


---
You
 do n't believe, and
---
that you ought
---
half- past two
 this afternoon, and where all the brethren are expecting me this
 minute. 
---
Here's the announcement."


---
whereon was printed the day,
 hour, and place of meeting,.

"
---
But how can you get there?
---
What, you have really arranged,
---
" to preach and--"

" I have arranged, and
---
you was on account of your being unsmirched in
 spite of all
---
; you withdrew yourself from me so quickly and resolutely

---
when you saw the situation
---
; you did not remain at my pleasure
---
; so
 there was one petticoat in the world for whom I had no contempt,

---
But you may well despise me now! 
---
what does this mean? 
---
But you have been the means-- the innocent means-- of
 my backsliding,. 
---
as they call it
---
' after they have escaped the
 pollutions of the world
---
who,, are again entangled therein and
---
one of
 those' servants of corruption' overcome'--
 whose latter end is worse than their beginning?" 
---
" And why then have you tempted me? 
---
that mouth again-- surely
 there never was such a maddening mouth since Eve's
---
; you dear
---
But the fact remains.

---
you ill- used on the farm
---
who has
---
before any scandal spreads
---
" to preach to those poor drunken boobies
 at the fair-- it is the first time I have played such a practical
 joke. 
---
It is the threshing of the last wheat- rick at Flintcomb- Ash farm.
---
The
 dawn of the March morning is singularly inexpressive, and
---
there is
 nothing to show where the eastern horizon lies. 
---
which has stood forlornly
 here through the washing and bleaching of the wintry weather
---
only a
 rustling denoted
---
that others had preceded them
---
as the
 light increased
---
there were
---
They were busily,; and
---
" unhaling" the rick, that
 is stripping off the thatch before beginning to throw down the
 sheaves, stood waiting
 and shivering, Farmer Groby having insisted upon their being on
 the spot thus early to get the job over if possible by the end of
 the day. 
---
whilst it was going
---
appertaining--
 the threshing- machine which,, kept up a
 despotic demand upon the endurance of their muscles and nerves
---
A little way off there was another indistinct figure
---
that spoke of strength very much in reserve
---
which
 radiated from the spot
---
The long chimney running up beside an ash- tree, and the warmth, explained without the necessity of much
 daylight that here was the engine which was to act as the_
---
By the engine stood
---
; these denizens of the fields served
 vegetation, weather, frost, and sun. 
---
as yet the steam
 threshing- machine was itinerant in this part of Wessex
---
The long strap was the sole tie- line
 between agriculture and him.


---
While they uncovered the sheaves
---
the morning
 air quivered
---
Beyond its extent the environment might be corn, straw,
 or chaos
---
The rick was unhaled by full daylight
---
the work began. 
---
" he"--had arrived ere this, and but on the rick; so that the feeder
 could seize it and.


---
which whisked
 out every grain in one moment
---
They were soon in full progress, after a preparatory hitch or two,
 which rejoiced the hearts of those who hated machinery. 
---
The work
 sped on till breakfast time,. 
---
when the thresher was stopped for half
 an hour; and
---
on starting again after the meal the whole supplementary
 strength of the farm was thrown into the labour of constructing the
 straw- rick, which began to grow beside the stack of corn
---
A hasty
 lunch was eaten without leaving their positions, and

---
as they stood,
---
then another couple of hours brought them near to dinner- time
---
; the
 inexorable wheel continuing, and.


---
the penetrating hum of the
 thresher to thrill to the very marrow all who were near the revolving
 wire- cage
---
; when everything, even to winnowing, was effected by
 hand- labour, which, to their thinking, though slow, produced better
 results
---
Those, too, on the corn- rick talked a little; but
---
who was one of them, in particular
---
while they wiped their faces or
---
as the drum never stopped
---
who fed
 it
---
For some probably economical reason it was usually
---
who was

---
this may
 have been true
---
which prevented speech
---
The hum of the thresher,,
 increased to a raving whenever the supply of corn fell short of the
 regular quantity. 
---
who fed
---
just before the dinner- hour a person had
, and
---
" Who is that?
---
the latter could not hear it.

"
---
" D'ye really think so? 
---
Dinner- time came, and
---
the whirling ceased;.


---
" You ought
---
" You would n't look so white then. 
---
Why, souls above us,
 your face is as if you'd been hagrode!"


---
when they were so far from their cottages
---
Sometimes,, they all did
 this; but
---
as there was rather a keen wind going to- day,
---
It was obvious at a glance
. 
---
that the original_ Weltlust_ had come back
---
The other workfolk were by this
 time
---
where the loose straw formed a
 comfortable retreat
---
as you see
---
" Why do you trouble me so!
---
why do you trouble me
---
" You say? 
---
you do n't
---
But you do! 
---
You haunt me. 
---
that
 you turned upon me with such a bitter flash a moment ago
---
Those very eyes, they come
 to me!

---
just as you showed them then, in the night and in the day
---
ever since you told me of that child of ours
---
Tess,, it is. 
---
which have been flowing in a strong puritanical stream
---
just as if
 my feelings,,
 had suddenly found a way open in the direction of you, and
---
The religious channel is left dry forthwith;
 and
---
it is you who have done it!"


---
What-- you have given up
---
" your preaching entirely
---
The deuce only knows
. 
---
No
 doubt they pray for me--
---
weep for me; for they are kind people in
 their way. 
---
What a grand revenge you have taken! 
---
Four years after, you find me a
 Christian enthusiast
---
; you then work upon me, perhaps to my complete
 perdition! 
---
you must not look so horribly concerned.

---
Of course you have done nothing. 
---
before you saw me--
---
-- you field- girls
 should never wear those bonnets."

---
if you wish
---
had been tempted by such a pretty face
---
Well, this paradise that you supply is perhaps as good as any other,
 after all
---
what you said last time
---
you have never told
 me-- about having what they call an ethical system without any dogma
---
" Why, you can have the religion of loving- kindness and purity at
 least,
---
if you ca n't have
---
I'm a different sort of fellow from that!  If there's nobody
 to say,' Do this, and
---
it will be a good thing for you
---
after you are
 dead
---
if there's nobody to be responsible to; and
---
" And
 there was never warmth with me! 
---
O why did n't you keep your faith,
!"


---
if the loss of it has brought you
---
Because you've knocked it out of me
---
"; so the evil be upon your sweet
 head! 
---
Ha- ha-- I'm awfully glad you have made an apostate of me all the
 same! 
---
you are in a bad way--
---
neglected by one
 who ought to cherish you
---
as if they
 were a quarter of a mile off
---
" It is cruelty to me!
---
" How-- how can you treat me to this
 talk,?"


---
if you care ever so little for me
---
you to be

---
You say
---
Well, perhaps you have; but. 
---
even if you have one
---
The words
 of the stern prophet Hosea to read come back to me.

---
Do n't you know them,
---
Tess, my trap
 is waiting just under the hill, and-- darling mine, not his!--you know
 the rest."


---
You have been the cause of my backsliding
---
It was heavy and thick as a warrior's, and
---
A scarlet oozing
 appeared. 
---
in a moment the blood began

---
before its captor twists its neck
---
" Whip me, crush
 me; you need! 
---
Once victim, always victim-- that's the law!"


---
Yet you most unjustly forget one thing,. 
---
if you had not put it out of my power
---
" You did."


---
" And you can not be. 
---
you are mine!"


---
The threshers now began.

"
---
You do n't know me yet! 
---
while the
 workers below rose and
---
they had
---
Then the threshing- machine started afresh; and
---
In the afternoon the farmer made
---
it known
---
that the rick was,
---
since there was a moon by which they could see
 to work, and
---
Hence the twanging and humming and rustling proceeded
 with even less intermission than usual.


---
It was not till" nammet"-time,. 
---
It meant. 
---
that their quarrel was over
---
Thus the afternoon dragged on. 
---
The wheat- rick shrank lower, and
---
the
 straw- rick grew higher, and
---
the corn- sacks were carted away. 
---
At six
 o'clock the wheat- rick was about shoulder- high from the ground. 
---
But
 the unthreshed sheaves remaining untouched seemed
---
countless still,
 notwithstanding the enormous numbers the greater part of them had passed. 
---
where in the morning there had been nothing
---
And the immense
 stack of straw, appeared
 as the faeces of the same buzzing red glutton. 
---
that wild March could afford in the way of
 sunset
---
A panting ache ran through the rick. 
---
who fed
---
whose place was upon the machine
---
as they had done
---
By degrees the freshest among them began. 
---
on which a perpetual stream of threshed straw
 ascended, a yellow river running uphill, and
---
But there was; and
---
another hour's work before the layer of live rats at
 the base of the stack would be reached
---
as the evening light in
 the direction of the Giant's Hill by Abbot's- Cernel dissolved away
---
,
 the white- faced moon of the season arose from the horizon that lay
 towards Middleton Abbey and Shottsford on the other side. 
---
this contingency, even with relief a month or two earlier, had
.


---
The sheaf- pitchers and feeders had now worked the rick so low that
 people on the ground could talk to them. 
---
also that this concession had been granted in obedience
 to the request of that friend, or enemy
---
The time for the rat- catching arrived at last, and
---
the hunt began.

---
The creatures had crept downwards with the subsidence of the rick
 and
---
till they were all together at the bottom,
---
, they ran across the open ground in all
 directions, a loud shriek from. 
---
The rat was
 and, amid the barking of dogs, masculine shouts,
 feminine screams, oaths, stampings, and confusion as of Pandemonium,

---
at last dislodged,; the drum slowed
---
, the whizzing ceased,
 and.


---
who had only looked on at the rat- catching
---
you say
---
" How the little limbs tremble! 
---
You are as weak as a bled calf
---
, you
 know and
---
you are;
---
yet you need.

---
How could you be so obstinate? 
---
if you will
---
that you came
---
before you knew o' my
 state
---
Perhaps-- perhaps you are a little better and kinder. 
---
you were
---
Whatever is meant
---
; whatever is meant in any other way
---
whatever it was,
---
My religious mania, or is over.

---
Have you seen'em lately
---
They did n't know. 
---
where you were
---
It was only by chance."


---
me break
 down quite
---
If you want
---
" to help them-- God knows
---
they
 need it
---
since, all was public indoors. 
---
me call you so
---
who it is
---
you can not think! 
---
Can you not come to me now, at once,
   ? 
---
before anything terrible happens
---
you can not
---
,
    because you are so far away
---
if you do
   
---
you have measured out to me
---
The punishment
    is deserved-- I do know that--
    well deserved-- and. 
---
you are right and
---
If you would come
---
that if so be you had forgiven me
---
it was necessary
---
you
    should find a farm
---
if you will send me one little line,
    and!

   
---
It has been so much my religion
---
it
    seems. 
---
Have you never felt one little bit of
    what you used to feel when we were at the dairy? 
---
If you
    have
---
, how can you keep away from me? 
---
you disliked but
---
What was the past to me
    as soon as I met you? 
---
It was a dead thing altogether. 
---
Why do you not see this? 
---
if you would only be a little more conceited, and
---
that you were strong enough to
    work this change in me
---
Dear,
    believe
    in yourself so far as to see, you would perhaps be in a mind.

   
---
to have known that such as
    that was not for poor me. 
---
how it do
    hurt my heart
---
Ah, your dear heart ache one little minute of each day
    as mine does every day and all day long
---
, it might lead you
   .

   
---
People still say. 
---
rather pretty, Angel( handsome is
    the word they use,)
---
what they say
---
because they belong to you
---
that there may be at least one thing about me worth your
    having
---
-- you will certainly know
   !

   
---
If you really can not come to me
---
, will you let? 
---
me come to
    you
---
It can not be, yet
---
more
    about this-- it makes me too miserable
---
But, my last state will be
    worse than my first. 
---
me
    come at once, or
---
The daylight has nothing to show me,,
    and
---
since you are not here
---
who used
---
what threatens me!--

   
---
the letter was redirected.


---
But the uncompromising Evangelical did not
 even now hold
---
, if not probable, that those very
 advantages might have been used. 
---
as Abraham might have mourned over the
 doomed Isaac
---
while they went up the hill together
---
They blamed themselves for this unlucky marriage. 
---
They did not distinctly know. 
---
At first they had supposed. 
---
it must be something of the nature
 of a serious aversion
---
they hoped
---
from which
 expressions the division might not owe its origin to
 anything so hopelessly permanent as that
---
in their doubts they had decided
---
which they knew no way of bettering
---
The severe illness almost
 decided
---
dazzled by representations of easy independence
---
The crowds of agricultural labourers,, had
 suffered. 
---
was less its beauty than
 its pathos. 
---
they wanted
---
The beauty or ugliness of
 a character lay not only in its achievements, but in its aims and
 impulses
---
; its true history lay, not among things done, but among
 things willed.


---
that was in spirit
---
it was. 
---
How much it really said
.


---
They were both in a state of mental depression, and

---
they spoke of home affairs. 
---
Confidence begat confidence. 
---
The next day they were drenched in a thunder- storm.
---
died by the week's end
---
an illegal surrender was not certain disesteem.

---
as if they were a god's
---
But the reasoning is somewhat musty
---
; lovers and husbands have gone
 over the ground before to- day. 
---
;
 there is no doubt of it. 
---
And yet these harshnesses are
 tenderness itself; the harshness of the position towards the
 temperament, of the means towards the aims, of to- day towards
 yesterday, of hereafter towards to- day.


---
they grow
---
, it was a most useful ingredient
 to the dreamer, to the moralizer on declines and. 
---
which left behind it a sense of sickness
---
Meanwhile the writer's expectation was alternately great and small. 
---
What lessened it

---
was--
---
which had led to the parting
---
Sighs were expended on the wish. 
---
by chance Amby
 remembered
---
in which they had
 indulged at the dairyman's
---
as they were
---
It would have melted the heart of a stone
---
that the days had lengthened
---
;, that
 Lady- Day was at hand, and.


---
before the quarter- day had quite come
---
But, something happened. 
---
which
 made
---
when somebody knocked at the door and
---
What-- is it' Liza- Lu
---
" What is the matter at home?"


---
the doctor says
---
' Liza- Lu
 was having some tea
---
To go that night would be a gain of twelve- hours; but
---
what had
 happened
---
marauders were wanting now, and
---
which was all that revealed itself of the vale on
---
that the
 difference was perceptible to the tread and to the smell
---
It was the
 heavy clay land of Blackmoor Vale, and a part of the Vale to which
 turnpike- roads had never penetrated. 
---
Superstitions linger longest on
 these heavy soils. 
---
Having once been forest, at this shadowy time it
 seemed and. 
---
the near
 being blended, and every tree and tall hedge making the most of its
 presence
---
that had been hunted here
---
that had
 been pricked and
---
as you passed;--the place teemed with beliefs in them still
---
they formed an impish multitude now.


---
as a hint of pink nebulosity appeared on
 Hambledon Hill
---
It came from the
 bedroom window, and
---
a branch waved in front of it and. 
---
which topped the chimney
---
as to disturb nobody; the lower room
 was vacant, but
---
the neighbour came
 to the top of the stairs, and. 
---
In the morning,, they had all a
 curiously elongated look
---
;, their growth was astounding; and
---
what
 it was
---
They spend lots o' money in keeping up old
 ruins, and
---
finding the bones o' things, and such like; and living
 remains must be more interesting to'em still,. 
---
if they only knowed
 of me
---
that somebody would go round and and
---
there
 is
---
what living among'em
---
who discovered me
---
If Pa'son
 Tringham,, had lived
---
When indoor necessities had been eased
---
It was now the season for
 planting and sowing
---
; many gardens and allotments of the villagers
 had already received their spring tillage; but
---
the garden and the
 allotment of the Durbeyfields were behindhand. 
---
that this was owing to their having eaten all the seed
 potatoes,--that last lapse of the improvident
---
The plot of ground was in a high,
 dry, open enclosure, where there were forty or fifty such pieces,
 and where labour was at its briskest when the hired labour of the
 day had ended. 
---
Digging began usually at six o'clock and extended
 indefinitely into the dusk or moonlight. 
---
Just now heaps of dead
 weeds and refuse were burning on many of the plots,.


---
the dry weather
 favouring their combustion
---
that
 divided the plots
---
as twilight succeeded
---
as wafted by the wind
---
When a fire glowed, banks
 of smoke, blown level along the ground
---
, would themselves become
 illuminated to an opaque lustre,; and
---
which was a wall
 by day and a light by night
---
the meaning of the" pillar of a cloud",, could be understood.


---
As evening thickened
---
the greater number remained. 
---
their planting
 done
---
irradiated by the
 brassy glare from the heap
---
that could be seen of them in the gloom
---
they caught a flash from the flames
---
which formed the
 boundary of the field
---
Westward, the wiry boughs of the bare thorn hedge rose against the pale opalescence of the lower
 sky. 
---
Above, Jupiter hung like a full- blown jonquil, so bright
 as almost to throw a shade. 
---
A few small nondescript stars were

---
In the distance a dog barked, and wheels
 occasionally rattled along the dry road.


---
Still the prongs continued;
 and
---
for it was not late
---
though the air was fresh and keen
---
there was a whisper of spring
 in it that cheered the workers on. 
---
Something in the place, the
 hours, the crackling fires, the fantastic mysteries of light and
 shade, made.
---
others as well as Tess enjoy
---
which in the frost of winter comes as a fiend and
---
Nightfall,
 in the warmth of
 summer as a lover, came as a tranquillizer on this March day.


---
The eyes of all were on the
 soil. 
---
as its turned surface was revealed by the fires
---
Sometimes the smoke divided them
---
; then it
 swerved, and
---
the two were visible to each other but divided from all
 the rest.


---
when it was broad daylight
---
The fire flared up,
 and
---
What do you say
---
" A jester might say. 
---
this is just like Paradise
---
You are Eve, and
---
the old Other One come
---
Some of it goes--


   "' Empress,
---
the way is ready, and not long,
   
---
If thou accept
    My conduct
---
Lead then,' said Eve.



---
because you think
 so badly of me
---
you were Satan, or
---
My thoughts of you are quite cold, except when you
 affront me. 
---
My dear Tess, I am only putting this to you as a thing
 that you might have supposed or said quite untruly,."

" I never said.  I do n't think of you in
 that way at all.  What, did you come?"


---
The smockfrock, hanging for sale, was an afterthought,. 
---
which I
 saw as I came along that I
 might n't be noticed I come."

 But I like"

" Your engagement at the other place is ended?"


---
" Where are you going to next? 
---
" It is quite true-- in the sense. 
---
you mean
---
But you have a friend, and

---
that you shall be comfortable in spite of yourself
---
When you get down to your house
---
O-- I do n't know!" you will see."


---
you would n't give me anything at all
---
it is not right
---
" It IS right!. 
---
", somebody ought
---
"

" How damned foolish this is!"
---
we are the same family; and
---
" O, Tessy-- what do you think! '
---
Liza- Lu is a- crying, and
---
there's a
 lot of folk in the house, and
---
they
 think
---
The child realized the grandeur of the news; but not as yet its
 sadness, and
---
n't we talk to father never no more?
---
" exclaimed Tess distractedly.

'
---
Liza- Lu came up.

"
---
the doctor said."


---
Yes; the Durbeyfield couple had changed places
---
; the dying one was
 out of danger, and
---
the indisposed one was dead. 
---
The news meant even
 more than it sounded. 
---
It
 was the last of the three lives for. 
---
whose duration the house and
 premises were held under a lease; and accommodation
---
Moreover," liviers" were disapproved of in villages
 almost as much as little freeholders, because of their independence
 of manner, and.


---
when a lease determined
---
it was never renewed
---
Thus the Durbeyfields, once d'Urbervilles, saw. 
---
when they were among the Olympians of
 the county
---
which, no doubt,, they had caused, and
---
severely
 enough, upon the heads of such landless ones as they themselves were
 now
---
-- the rhythm of change-- alternate and
 persist in everything under the sky.




---
At length it was the eve of Old Lady- Day, and
---
the agricultural world
 was in a fever of mobility. 
---
It is a day of fulfilment. 
---
; agreements for outdoor
 service during the ensuing year, entered into at Candlemas,
---
as they used
---
till the other word was introduced from
 without
---
-- who wish
---
The labourers-- or" work- folk", to
 call themselves immemorially to remain no longer in old places are removing to
 the new farms.


---
These annual migrations from farm to farm were on the increase here.

---
the majority of the field- folk about
 Marlott had remained all their lives on one farm, which had been the
 home also of their fathers and grandfathers; but. 
---
With the younger
 families it was a pleasant excitement which might possibly be an
 advantage. 
---
The Egypt of one family was the Land of Promise to the
 family who saw it from a distance, till by residence there it became
 it turn their Egypt also; and so they changed and changed.


---
However, all the mutations so increasingly discernible in village
 life did not originate entirely in the agricultural unrest. 
---
A
 depopulation was also going on. 
---
side by side with the argicultural labourers, an interesting and
 better- informed class, ranking distinctly above the former
---
as the long holdings fell
 in
---
But, they were seldom, and
---
who were
---
Cottagers not directly employed on the land. 
---
the banishment of some starved the trade of
 others, who were thus obliged to follow
---
who had
 formed the backbone of the village life in the past
---
who were the
 depositaries of the village traditions
---
These families,,, had
---
to seek refuge in the
 large centres; the process, humorously designated by statisticians as
" the tendency of the rural population towards the large towns",.


---
when forced by machinery
---
The cottage accommodation at Marlott having been in this manner

---
considerably curtailed by demolitions
---
which remained

---
( whose descent was not credited)

---
Ever
 since the occurrence of the event, the Durbeyfield family had been tacitly looked on as one which would have to go when their
 lease ended, if only in the interests of morality. 
---
It was, indeed,
 quite true. 
---
that the household had not been shining examples either of
 temperance, soberness, or chastity
---
the younger children seldom had gone to
 church, and
---
the eldest daughter had made queer unions. 
---
By some means
 the village had. 
---
So on this, the first Lady- Day
 on which the Durbeyfields were expellable,,

---
the house, being roomy
---
On the evening preceding their removal it was getting dark betimes by
 reason of a drizzling rain which blurred the sky. 
---
As it was the last
 night they would spend in the village which had been their home and
 birthplace, Mrs Durbeyfield,' Liza- Lu, and
---
Abraham had gone out to
 bid some friends goodbye, and
---
till they should
 return
---
which had been mistakenly placed in a corner where no flies
 ever came, and shivered in the slight draught through the casement
---
this means

---
By they had found
---
It was not. 
---
The rain had and
---
Did n't you see me
---
it was a carriage and horses
---
you heard the d'Urberville Coach, perhaps. 
---
You know the legend
---
My-- somebody was going, but."


---
, so it does n't matter
---
It is
 rather dismal. 
---
It is
---
that this sound of a non- existent coach can
 only be heard by one of d'Urberville blood, and
---
it is held. 
---
who hears it
---
It has,
."


---
committed by one of the family, centuries ago
---
Now you have begun it
---
One of the family is said
---
who tried
---
Such is one version of the tale... 
---
that
 your tubs and buckets are packed
---
I forget which.  I see.  Going away, are n't you?"


---
you were
---
could hardly believe it; it seems so sudden.

---
" I heard, but Why is it?"


---
when that dropped
---
we
 had no further right to stay. 
---
Though we might
---
if it had not been for me
---
May their dirty souls
 be burnt to cinders!
---
" That's
---
why you are going
---
, is it? 
---
" We are not turned out exactly; but
---
as they said
---
we should have
---
, it was best to go now."


---
everybody was moving,
---
because there are
 better chances
---
" Where are you going to?
---
We have taken rooms there. 
---
there's the house,, and the garden. 
---
as you know it
---
It
 can be whitewashed in a day, and
---
I will put the children to a good school.  Really
 I ought!"

" But we have already taken the rooms at Kingsbere!"
---
" And we can wait there--"


---
even
 if you wo n't believe it
---
We'll get
 up a regular colony of fowls, and
---
Now look here,
 Tess, I know, and,, I am quite positive Now, though I have been your enemy, I am your friend,.  the children can go to school."


---
that you would do all this
---
Your views may
 change-- and then
---
-- we should be
---
the house swept out
 and
---
whitened to- morrow morning, and fires lit
---
it will be dry by
 the evening,. 
---
so that you can come straight there
---
you know
---
" And you
 cured me, too, of that craze;
---
rather you had kept the craze,
---
so that you had kept the
 practice which went with it
---
" Damnation-- you are very cruel!.

---
you did n't do it on purpose
---
IF you ask for it
---
But; you'll never
 ask for it-- you'll!"


---
You go to the devil
---
these hard judgements had

---
O why have you treated me so monstrously, Angel
---
You know? 
---
why have you so wronged
    me
---
You are cruel, cruel indeed! 
---
It is all injustice I have received at your
    hands!
                                  
---
It was just as well. 
---
The facts had not changed
---
It grew darker, the fire- light shining over the room. 
---
; the
 four smallest, their ages ranging from three- and- a- half years to
 eleven, all in black frocks, were gathered round. 
---
the hearth babbling
 their own little subjects
---
This is the last night that we shall sleep here, dears, in the house
 where we were born
---
We ought"


---
,
 ought n't we?
---
They all became silent
---
" to think of it; with the impressibility of their age they
 were ready to burst into tears at the picture of finality. 
---
though all the day hitherto they had been rejoicing in
 the idea of a new place
---
" What shall we sing?
---
you know
---
There was a momentary pause
---
; it was broken
---
, first, in one little
 tentative note; then a second voice strengthened it, and a third
 and a fourth chimed in unison, with words they had learnt at the
 Sunday- school--


      Here we suffer grief and pain,
      Here we meet to part again
---
;
        In Heaven we part no more.



---
The four sang on with the phlegmatic passivity of persons who had
 long ago
---
there being no mistake about it
---
that further thought was not required
---
With features strained
 hard
---
to enunciate the syllables they continued, the notes of the youngest straying over into
 the pauses of the rest.


---
Darkness had

---
It was really. 
---
what the children were singing
---
If only believe;,
 how different all would now be
---
But trailing clouds of glory do we come.



---
, whose gratuitousness nothing in the result seemed, and
---
" Hev
 somebody called?"


---
Who was the gentleman?
---
Then who was it?"


---
" Oh, you need n't ask. 
---
when we are settled in our lodging at Kingsbere
 to- morrow-- every word
---
while it was still dark
---
During the small hours of the next morning,,
 dwellers near the highways were conscious of a disturbance of their
 night's rest by rumbling noises,-- noises as certain to recur in this particular first week of
 the month as the voice of the cuckoo in the third week of the same.

---
They were the preliminaries of the general removal, the passing of
 the empty waggons and teams
---
That this might be accomplished within the day.


---
the explanation
 of the reverberation occurring so soon after midnight, the aim of
 the carters being to reach the door of the outgoing households by
 six o'clock, when the loading of their movables at once began
---
they were not regular labourers
---
they were
---
;;
 not particularly required anywhere; hence they had, and.


---
nothing sent gratuitously
---
though the weather was windy and louring
---
, it
 did not rain, and. 
---
that the waggon had come
---
A wet Lady- Day was a
 spectre which removing families never forgot; damp furniture, damp
 bedding, damp clothing accompanied it, and left a train of ills.


---
the younger
 children were let sleep on. 
---
The four breakfasted by the thin light,
 and
---
the" house- ridding" was taken in hand.


---
It proceeded with some cheerfulness, a friendly neighbour or two
. 
---
When the large articles of furniture had been packed in
 position
---
After loading there was a long delay but
---
before the horses were

---
these having been unharnessed during the ridding
---
at
 length, about two o'clock, the whole was under way,. 
---
till they were out of the village
---
They had called on a few neighbours that morning and the previous
 evening, and
---
some came,,
 though, in their secret hearts,. 
---
as the Durbeyfields were to all except
 themselves
---
Soon the equipage began,
 and
---
the wind grew keener with the change of level and soil.


---
The day being the sixth of April, the Durbeyfield waggon met many
 other waggons with families on the summit of the load, probably, to
 the rural labourer as the hexagon to the bee. 
---
which was

---
The groundwork of the
 arrangement was the family dresser, which, with its shining handles,
 and finger- marks, and domestic evidences thick upon it, stood
 importantly in front, over the tails of the shaft- horses, in its
 erect and natural position, like some Ark of the Covenant that they
 were bound to carry reverently.


---
Some of the households were lively, some mournful
---
; some were stopping
 at the doors of wayside inns;
---
where, in due time, the Durbeyfield
 menagerie also drew up.


---
for it was
---
they, sitting
 with the moving family at whose house they had lodged
---
Are you

---
" house- ridding to- day, like everybody else?"

 They were, they said. 
---
It had been too rough a life for them at
 Flintcomb- Ash, and
---
they had come away, almost without notice,
. 
---
" Do you know? 
---
who follows
---
that
 the gentleman' ee-- you'll guess--
---
after you had gone
---
who I mean We did n't tell'n,."


---
where you
 was
---
you would n't wish
---
where you be going
---
the two waggons resumed their journey in
 opposite directions
---
with whom they had thrown in their lot,
---
drawn by three powerful horses with shining
 brass ornaments on their harness
---
while the waggon was a creaking erection that would
 scarcely bear the weight of the superincumbent load
---
which had

---
being
 brightly painted, and;; one known no paint.

---
since it was made, and
---
drawn by two horses only
---
The contrast well marked the difference between being fetched by a
 thriving farmer and conveying oneself
---
whither no hirer waited.


---
one's
 coming
---
The distance was great-- too great for a day's journey-- and
---
it was
 with the utmost difficulty that the horses performed it. 
---
Though they
 had started so early
---
, it was quite late in the afternoon. 
---
when they
 turned the flank of an eminence which formed part of the upland
 called Greenhill
---
While the horses stood
---
where lay those ancestors of whom: Kingsbere, the spot of all spots in the world which
 could be considered the d'Urbervilles' home
---
since they had resided
 there for full five hundred years
---
you wanted
---
that the rooms be let
---
We did n't
 know. 
---
that you was coming
---
till we got your letter this morning-- when
' twas too late
---
you can get other lodgings somewhere
---
What
 shall we do now, Tess?
---
" Here's a welcome to
 your ancestors' lands! 
---
's try further
---
They moved on into the town, and
---
the goods must be
 unloaded,, and
---
as the horses were half- dead
---
The waggon had drawn up under the churchyard wall, in a spot screened
 from view, and
---
the driver, nothing loth, soon hauled down the poor
 heap of household goods. 
---
It
 was a dry night, and
---
that they would come to no harm
---
The cold sunlight
 of this spring evening peered invidiously upon the crocks and
 kettles, upon the bunches of dried herbs shivering in the breeze,
 upon the brass handles of the dresser, upon the wicker- cradle they
 had all been rocked in, and
---
upon the well- rubbed clock- case, all of
 which gave out the reproachful gleam of indoor articles abandoned to
 the vicissitudes of a roofless exposure. 
---
for which they were never

---
Round about were deparked hills and slopes-- now cut up
 into little paddocks-- and the green foundations that showed where
 the d'Urberville mansion once had stood
---
that had always belonged to the estate
---
Hard by,
 the aisle of the church called the d'Urberville Aisle looked on
 imperturbably.


---
your family vault your own freehold
---
that's
---
where we will camp,
---
Now, Tess and' Liza and Abraham,
 you help me. 
---
We'll make a nest for these children, and
---
then we'll
 have another look round."


---
in a quarter of an hour the old
 four- post bedstead was dissociated from the heap of goods, and

---
the part of the building
 known as the d'Urberville Aisle, beneath which the huge vaults lay.

---
Over the tester of the bedstead was a beautiful traceried window, of
 many lights,. 
---
its date being the fifteenth century
---
It was called
 the d'Urberville Window, and.


---
If it comes to the
 worst we can sleep there too, for one night
---
us
 try further on
---
if it leaves
 us like this
---
Accompanied by' Liza- Lu and the boy
---
as they got
 into the street
---
" This is
 indeed a family gathering on the historic spot!"


---
they should be still unsuccessful in
 their search for shelter
---
When they had
 gone
---
that no more could
 be done
---
to be embrowned by the shades of nightfall
---
The door of the church was unfastened, and
---
under which the bedstead stood
---
Within the window were the tombs of
 the family, covering in their dates several centuries. 
---
They were
 canopied. 
---
, altar- shaped, and plain; their carvings being defaced
 and; their brasses torn from the matrices, the rivet- holes
 remaining like martin- holes in a sandcliff
---
Of all the reminders
 there was none so forcible as this spoliation.


---
the
 oldest of them all, on which was a recumbent figure. 
---
for an odd fancy that the effigy moved
---
that the figure was a living
 person
---
you come in
---
A family gathering, is it not, with
 these old fellows under us here? 
---
" That shook them a bit
---
" And you
 thought. 
---
Mind this; you'll be civil yet
---
where they were going
---
what's hovering round
---
" Could we let?"


---
They thought of this all the way to their destination; but
---
the bustle
 of re- establishment in their new place took up all their attention
 then. 
---
when they were settled
---
sore put to by an Enemy in the shape
    of a Friend. 
---
continual dropping will wear away a Stone-- ay,
    more-- a Diamond.

   
---
; after which they
 continued in a mood of emotional exaltation at their own generosity,
.



---
which made
---
them sing in hysterical snatches and
---
It was evening at Emminster Vicarage. 
---
The two customary candles were
 burning under their green shades in the Vicar's study, but
---
which sufficed for the increasing mildness of the spring
---
It faced westward, and
---
though gloom prevailed inside
---
, there was still
 light enough without. 
---
who had
 been sitting in the drawing- room
---
" Plenty of time yet," said the Vicar. 
---
if the train should be punctual, and ten miles of
 country- road,
---
" even five of them in Crimmercrock Lane, are not jogged over
 in a hurry by our old horse."


---
Thus they passed the minutes,.


---
each well knowing
---
that this was only
 waste of breath,
---
At length there was a slight noise in the lane, and
---
the old
 pony- chaise appeared indeed outside the railings. 
---
They saw alight
 therefrom a form which they affected to recognize, but.


---
when a particular person
 was due
---
who was just about to enter
---
The new arrival,, saw their anxious faces
 in the doorway and the gleam of the west in their spectacles; but
---
because
 they confronted the last rays of day
---
as they reached the room
 where the candles were lighted
---
was. 
---
that figure
 from its former contours by worry and the bad season experienced, in the climate
---
you know
---
It was
 only a slight attack of faintness, resulting from the tedious day's
 journey, and the excitement of arrival.


---
Has any letter come for me lately?
---
, we supposed?"


---
" It was.
---
"

 Only one other had recently come. 
---
O why have you treated me so monstrously, Angel!
---
You know? 
---
why have you so wronged
    me
---
You are cruel, cruel indeed! 
---
It is all injustice I have received at your
    hands!
                                  
---
" It is quite true!"
---
Well, we all are children of the soil. 
---
so in the sense you mean
---
me now explain to you
---
The circumstances were such. 
---
it was not so easy
 as it had seemed
---
Supposing, a sudden meeting might lead to bitter words.


---
before the week was out there
---
for it bore
 no address,
---
it was not written from Marlott
---
SIR,

    J write these few lines
---
that my Daughter is away
    from me at present, and
---
J will let.
   
---
J do not feel at liberty. 
---
J should say
---
The strength showed signs of coming back,
 but
---
if you do not come
    soon, or
---
If
    you would come
---
that if so be you had forgiven
    me
---
if you will send me one little line, and
---
how it do hurt my heart
---
Ah, your
    dear heart ache one little minute of each day as mine
    does every day and all day long
---
, it might lead you.... 
---
what
    threatens me
---
their Christianity was.


---
reprobates being their especial care,
---
as it disappeared into the street
---
The pale and
 blasted nettle- stems of the preceding year even now lingered nakedly
 in the banks, young green nettles of the present spring growing from
 their roots.


---
shown not much less by this abstention than by the hardships.


---
it therefore became necessary
---
the only course was
---
who had been so churlish with
---
It was as yet too early in the year
---
for much colour to appear in the
 gardens and foliage
---
; the so- called spring was but
---
winter overlaid
 with a thin coat of greenness, and
---
The new
 residents were in the garden,. 
---
as if the homestead had never passed its primal time in
 conjunction with the histories of others,
---
beside which the histories
 of these were but as a tale told by an idiot
---
They walked about the
 garden paths with thoughts of their own concerns entirely uppermost,
. 
---
as though the time there were not one whit intenser in story than now
---
Even the spring
 birds sang over their heads.


---
as if they thought
---
there was nobody
 missing in particular
---
On inquiry of these precious innocents, to whom even the name of
 their predecessors was a failing memory
---
that they were going, but
---
they mentioned
---
It was as bad as the house-- even worse. 
---
The inscription ran thus:


  
---
ARE THE MIGHTY FALLEN
---
who put it up
---
that the
 statement was true
---
The distance was too long for a walk, but
---
It was plain
---
" You said
."

"
---
you would write to me again, but
---
you have not done so
---
Because she've not come home
---
" Do you know?"


---
But you ought.


---
had by
 this time
---
asked--

" Do you think? 
---
me to try and
---
" Are you sure?"


---
That's very likely, sir
---
Sandbourne has become a large place
---
, they say."


---
It was apparent, and
---
Are you in want of anything
---
We are
---
There was a station
 three miles ahead, and
---
It was too
 late to call on or inquire for any one, and
---
An outlying eastern tract of the enormous Egdon Waste was close at
 hand, yet on the very verge of that tawny piece of antiquity such a
 glittering novelty as this pleasure city had chosen to spring up.

---
Within the space of a mile from its outskirts every irregularity
 of the soil was prehistoric, every channel an undisturbed British
 trackway
---
; not a sod having been turned there since the days of the
 Caesars. 
---
Yet the exotic had grown here, suddenly as the prophet's
 gourd; and.


---
the place was
---
It
 was a city of detached mansions; a Mediterranean lounging- place on
 the English Channel; and as seen now by night it seemed even more
 imposing than it was.


---
The sea was near at hand, but not intrusive
---
; it murmured, and
---
it was the pines
---
; the pines murmured in precisely the same
 tones, and
---
they were the sea
---
Were there any cows to milk here? 
---
There certainly were
 no fields.
---
which of them might be hers
---
Conjecture was useless, and
---
This also was strange to the postman.


---
There's visitors coming and going every day, as you know, sir
---
the name was
.


---
," said the second.


---
" That's it!"
---
The Herons, though an ordinary
 villa, stood in its own grounds, and
---
in which one would have expected
---
so private was
 its appearance. 
---
The hour being early, the landlady herself opened the door. 
---
" It is rather early. 
---
It is my Christian name. 
---
the door opened
---
can you forgive me for going away
---
Ca n't
 you-- come to me? 
---
How do you get-- like this?"


---
It is too late
---
as you were
---
whose tortures cause
---
every instant to seem an hour
---
No-- you must not. 
---
" But do n't you love me, my dear wife,? 
---
You are not so fickle
---
it is too late
---
who tries
---
" Do n't you know all
---
-- don't you know it? 
---
Yet how
 do you come here?"


---
if you do not know
---
" But you did not come! 
---
you did not come!
---
you would never come
 any more, and
---
that you
 would not come again
---
you HAVE come! 
---
These clothes are
---
But-- will you go
 away,
---
They stood fixed, their baffled hearts looking out of their eyes with
 a joylessness pitiful to see. 
---
Both seemed.


---
" Ah-- it is my fault!
---
Speech was as inexpressive as silence. 
---
it to drift,
---
A few instants passed, and

 of all the handsome furniture

LVI


 Mrs Brooks, the lady, was not a person of an unusually
 curious turn of mind.
---
which had been stifled
 down as useless
---
Mrs Brooks,, could
 hear fragments of the conversation-- between those two wretched souls. 
---
if conversation it could be

---
Then the door of the room
 above was shut, and
---
Mrs Brooks knew. 
---
As the young lady was
---
not fully dressed, Mrs Brooks knew
.


---
which was a bedroom)
---
This first floor, containing Mrs Brooks's best apartments,
 had been taken by the week by the d'Urbervilles. 
---
The back room was
 now in silence; but
---
from the drawing- room there came sounds.


---
as if it came from a
 soul bound to some Ixionian wheel--

" O-- O-- O
---
The landlady looked through the keyhole. 
---
Only a small space of the
 room inside was visible, but
---
within that space came a corner of the
 breakfast table, which was already spread for the meal, and also a
 chair beside. 
---
from which the slippers had fallen,
---
that came the murmur of unspeakable despair
---
which was a soliloquy
 rather than an exclamation
---
Mrs Brooks could only catch a portion:

"
---
And you had used your cruel persuasion upon me...
---
you
 did not stop-- no--
---
using it you did not stop!
---
Mrs Brooks could see the pain upon it,
 and. 
---
O, you
 have torn my life all to pieces
---
me be
---
me be again
---
that the speaker
 was coming
---
Mrs Brooks, thinking to rush out of the door, hastily retreated down the
 stairs.


---
But Mrs Brooks felt it unsafe to watch on the
 landing again, and.


---
the floorboards slightly creak,
---
as if some one were

---
They might have
 quarrelled, or
---
Mrs Brooks pondered on
 the delay, and on what probable relation the visitor who had called
 so early bore to the couple upstairs. 
---
It was about the size of a wafer
, but
---
that it was red
---
The oblong
 white ceiling, with this scarlet blot in the midst, had the
 appearance of a gigantic ace of hearts.


---
Mrs Brooks had strange qualms of misgiving. 
---
It was damp,
 and
---
that it was a blood stain
---
which was the bedchamber at
 the back of the drawing- room
---
The dead silence within was broken only by a regular beat.


---
Mrs Brooks hastened downstairs,. 
---
The workman assented, and.


---
The room was empty
---
that the carving- knife was missing
---
" My good God, the gentleman in bed is
 dead! 
---
a lot of blood had run
 down upon the floor!"


---
The alarm was soon given, and
---
which had lately been so
 quiet
---
the house resounded with the tramp of many footsteps, a surgeon among the
 rest. 
---
The wound was small, but
---
the point of the blade had touched
 the heart of the victim,. 
---
who was a temporary
 visitor to the town
---
In a
 quarter of an hour the news, spread through every
 street and villa of the popular watering- place.




---
been accepted by Mercy Chant
---
that there would be no train leaving for an
 hour and more
---
which had been the scene of such an experience
---
The highway was open, and. 
---
across which it could be seen
---
something seemed. 
---
It was a human figure running. 
---
It was not.

Angel as if waiting for this," do you know

You know it,

---
do n't you? 
---
You believe it? 
---
You did n't come back to me, and. 
---
Why did you go away--
---
why did you--? 
---
why you did it
---
;
 only, Angel, will you forgive me my sin against you
---
that you would be sure to
 forgive me now I have done that
---
It came to me as a shining light
 that I should get you back that way. 
---
-- you do n't know! 
---
your
 not loving me
---
you do now, dear, dear husband
---
you do
---
"-- it is!"
---
But how do you
 mean
---
me crying about you
---
called you by a foul name;
---
My heart could not
 bear it. 
---
what obscure strain in the d'Urberville blood had led to
 this aberration
---
if it were an aberration
---
that the family tradition of the coach and murder
 might have arisen
---
because the d'Urbervilles had been known
---
It was very terrible if true; if a temporary hallucination, sad. 
---
whatever you may have done or
---
They then walked on under the trees,. 
---
as of old, all that was perfection, personally and
 mentally. 
---
they promenaded over the dry bed
 of fir- needles
---
that there was a corpse
---
Are we going anywhere in particular
---
" Well, we might walk a few miles further, and. 
---
when it is evening find
 lodgings somewhere or other-- in a lonely cottage, perhaps
---
Can you
 walk well, Tessy?"


---
your arm round me
---
Upon the whole it seemed a good thing to do. 
---
Thereupon they
 quickened their pace,. 
---
But there was an unpractical
 vagueness in their movements throughout the day
---
; neither one of them
 seemed. 
---
Their every idea was temporary and unforefending,
 like the plans of two children.


---
At mid- day they drew near to a roadside inn, and but
---
; even the ivory- handled parasol was of a shape unknown in the retired spot to which they
 had now wandered; and
---
the cut of such articles would have attracted
 attention in the settle of a tavern. 
---
They sat down upon some dead boughs and. 
---
Between
 one and two o'clock they packed up the remainder and.


---
we may as well steer in a general way towards the interior
 of the country, where we can hide for a time, and are less likely to
 be looked for than anywhere near the coast
---
when they have forgotten us
---
" Later
 on,, we can make for some port."


---
they went. 
---
Though the season was an English May
---
,
 the weather was serenely bright, and
---
during the afternoon it was
 quite warm. 
---
their footpath
 had taken them into the depths of the New Forest, and
---
Through the latter miles of their walk towards
 evening, turning the corner of a lane, they perceived behind a brook
 and bridge a large board on which was painted in white letters
---
This
 desirable Mansion to be Let Furnished"
---
,"; particulars following, with
 directions to apply to some London agents. 
---
Passing through the gate
 they could see the house, an old brick building of regular design and
 large accommodation.


---
" It is Bramshurst Court. 
---
You can see."


---
that
 it is shut up, and
---
grass is growing on the drive
---
Some of the windows are open
---
All these rooms empty, and we without a roof to our heads!"

" You are getting tired, my Tess
---
" We'll stop soon." 
---
for they had wandered a dozen or
 fifteen miles
---
it became necessary. 
---
what they should
 do for rest
---
They looked from afar at isolated cottages and little
 inns, and
---
when their
 hearts failed them
---
they sheered off. 
---
At length their gait
 dragged, and
---
they stood still.

"
---
Could we sleep under the trees?
---
we passed
---
us go back towards it again
---
They retraced their steps, but
---
it was half an hour. 
---
before they stood
 without the entrance- gate as earlier
---
who was within
---
Now, we can get in through one of the lower
 windows, and
---
, whose
 shuttered windows, like sightless eyeballs, excluded the possibility
 of watchers. 
---
The door was reached a few steps further, and.
---
one of
 the windows beside it was open
---
Except the hall, the rooms were all in darkness, and
---
they ascended
 the staircase. 
---
Up here also the shutters were for this day at least,
 by opening the hall- window in front and an upper window behind.

---
the ventilation being perfunctorily done
---
A shaft of dazzling sunlight glanced into the room,, and
---
an enormous
 four- post bedstead, along the head of which were carved.


---
They remained in great quietness. 
---
till the caretaker should have come
: as a precaution,
---
they
 were in
---
They heard. 
---
they shared another meal,.




---
till by- and- by they
 were enveloped in the shades of night
---
which they had no candle to
 disperse
---
The night was strangely solemn and still. 
---
" Why did n't you tell me next day?"
---
" It might have prevented
 much misunderstanding and woe."


---
what's past
---
should we! 
---
Who knows what to- morrow has in
 store?"


---
But it apparently had no sorrow. 
---
The morning was wet and foggy, and

---
that the caretaker only opened the windows
 on fine days,
---
There was no food on the premises, but

---
there was water, and
---
that they might get
---
They were indisposed, and
---
the day passed, and
---
their
 being aware
---
; till, almost without, five days had slipped by in absolute seclusion, not a
 sight or sound of a human being disturbing their peacefulness, such
 as it was. 
---
The changes of the weather were their only events, the
 birds of the New Forest their only company. 
---
they
 hardly once spoke of any incident of the past subsequent to their
 wedding- day. 
---
The gloomy intervening time seemed,
. 
---
as if it never had

---
that they should leave their shelter,
 and
---
" Why should we put an end to all that's sweet and lovely!
---
What must come
---
" will come." 
---
And, looking through the
 shutter- chink:" All is trouble outside there; inside here content."


---
It was quite true
---
what you think of me now
---
that
 may not last
---
when the time comes
---
for you to despise me
---
so that it may
 never be known to me
---
that you despised me
---
what my life has been
---
me cry
---
They remained yet another day. 
---
In the night the dull sky cleared,
 and
---
the result was.

---
that the old caretaker at the cottage awoke early
---
Thus it occurred
---
wherein they lay
---
The lock was out of order, but
---
a piece of
 furniture had been moved forward on the inside,. 
---
which prevented
---
A stream of morning light
 through the shutter- chink fell upon the faces of the pair, wrapped in
 profound slumber
---
The caretaker was so struck with their innocent
 appearance, and. 
---
as it
 seemed
---
Both had a sense that something had disturbed
 them,; and
---
though they could not say what
---
which
 it engendered
---
the uneasy feeling grew stronger. 
---
we will leave at once
---
" It is a fine day.
---
putting the room in order, they took up
 the few articles that belonged to them, and.

---
" My life can only be a
 question of a few weeks. 
---
Why should we not have stayed there?"


---
We shall soon get out of this district
 altogether. 
---
We'll continue our course, and. 
---
as we've begun it
---
Nobody will think of looking for us there. 
---
We shall
 be looked for at the Wessex ports. 
---
if we are sought at all
---
When we
 are in the north
---
we will get to a port and away."


---
they kept a
 bee- line northward. 
---
Their long repose at the manor- house lent them
. 
---
they found
---
that they were

---
which lay directly in
 their way
---
their night march began
---
, the boundary
 between Upper and Mid- Wessex being crossed about eight o'clock.


---
The
 intercepting city, ancient Melchester, they were obliged. 
---
that obstructed them
---
It was about midnight.

---
when they
 went along the deserted streets,
---
lighted fitfully by the few lamps,

---
that it might not echo their footsteps
---
The graceful pile of cathedral architecture rose dimly on their left
 hand, but
---
it was lost upon them now. 
---
Once out of the town they
 followed the turnpike- road, which after a few miles plunged across an
 open plain.


---
Though the sky was dense with cloud
---
, a diffused light from some
 fragment of a moon had hitherto helped them a little. 
---
But the moon
 had now sunk
---
, the clouds seemed
---
the night grew as dark as a cave. 
---
However, they found their way
 along,. 
---
which it was easy to do
---
there being no hedge or fence
 of any kind
---
All around was open loneliness and black solitude,
---
over
 which a stiff breeze blew.


---
They had almost struck
 themselves against it.


---
" What monstrous place is this?
---
It hums
---
The wind, playing upon the edifice, produced a booming
 tune, like the note of some gigantic one- stringed harp. 
---
No other
 sound came from it, and
---
It seemed. 
---
that was a colossal
 rectangular pillar;
---
At an indefinite height overhead something
 made the black sky blacker, which had the semblance of a vast
 architrave uniting the pillars horizontally. 
---
They carefully entered
 beneath and between
---
; the surfaces echoed their soft rustle; but
---
they
 seemed. 
---
The place was roofless. 
---
What can it be
---
Feeling sideways they encountered another tower- like pillar, square
 and uncompromising as the first; beyond it another and another. 
---
The
 place was all doors and pillars, some connected above by continuous
 architraves.


---
The next pillar was isolated
---
; others composed a trilithon
---
; others
 were prostrate,; and
---
their flanks forming a causeway wide enough for a
 carriage
---
it was soon obvious. 
---
that they made up a forest of
 monoliths grouped upon the grassy expanse of the plain
---
The couple
 advanced further into this pavilion of the night.


---
till they stood in
 its midst
---
" It is Stonehenge!
---
" The heathen temple, you mean?"


---
what shall we do
---
We may find shelter further on."


---
was sheltered from the wind by a
 pillar
---
Owing to the action of the sun during the preceding day, the
 stone was warm and dry, in comforting contrast to the rough and.


---
" Ca n't we bide here?"


---
This spot is visible for miles by day,
---
although it does

---
And you used. 
---
" Sleepy are you, dear? 
---
you are lying on an altar
---
" It is so solemn and
 lonely-- after my great happiness-- with nothing but the sky above my
 face. 
---
It seems we two;
 and
---
as if there were no folk in the world but
---
there were not-- except' Liza- Lu
---
till it should get a little
 lighter
---
if anything happens to me
---
" Angel,, will you watch over' Liza- Lu for
 my sake?
---
when they had listened a long time to the wind
 among the pillars
---
if you lose me
---
as you will do shortly
---
, if you would!"


---
" That's nothing, dearest. 
---
People marry sister- laws continually about
 Marlott; and
---
' Liza- Lu is so gentle and sweet, and
---
when we are
 spirits
---
to become yours it would almost seem... 
---
as if
 death had not divided us
---
The uniform
 concavity of black cloud was lifting bodily like the lid of a pot,

---
against which the
 towering monoliths and trilithons began.

"
---
Well, I have said it.  I wo n't mention
 it again."

 Did they sacrifice to God here?"
---
set away by itself
---
That lofty stone is in the
 direction of the sun,."


---
which will presently rise behind it
---
This reminds me, dear
---
" You remember before we were married? 
---
you never would
 interfere with any belief of mine
---
as you thought
---
because you thought so
---
do you think
---
we shall meet again
---
after we are dead
---
that means no
---
who love each other
---
and they were again silent. 
---
The band of silver paleness along the east
 horizon made
---
even the distant parts of the Great Plain appear dark
 and near; and
---
the whole enormous landscape bore that impress of
 reserve, taciturnity, and hesitation.

---
which is usual just before day
---
The eastward pillars and their architraves stood up blackly against
 the light, and the great flame- shaped Sun- stone beyond them; and the
 Stone of Sacrifice midway. 
---
Presently the night wind died out, and

---
the quivering little pools in the cup- like hollows of the stones lay
 still. 
---
At the same time something seemed. 
---
they had gone
 onward,
---
The figure
 came straight towards the circle of pillars in which they were.


---
;,
 another was at hand on the right, under a trilithon, and another on
 the left. 
---
They all closed in with evident purpose. 
---
" It is no use,
---
" There are sixteen of us on the Plain,
 and the whole country is reared."


---
as
 they gathered round
---
When they saw,
---
which they had not done till then
---
, they
 showed no objection, and. 
---
All waited in the growing light, their
 faces and hands as if they were silvered, the remainder of their
 figures dark,. 
---
the stones glistening green- gray, the Plain still a
 mass of shade
---
Soon the light was strong, and
---
What is it, Angel
---
" Have they come for me?"


---
" They have come."


---
" It is
---
as it should be
---
This happiness could not have lasted. 
---
It was too much. 
---
for you to despise me
---
that fine old city, aforetime capital
 of Wessex, lay amidst its convex and concave downlands in all the
 brightness and warmth of a July morning
---
The gabled brick, tile, and
 freestone houses had almost dried off for the season in the sloping
 High Street, from the West Gateway to the mediæval cross, and
---
their integument
 of lichen, the streams in the meadows were low, and
---
from
 the mediæval cross to the bridge, that leisurely dusting and sweeping
 was in progress.


---
which usually ushers in an old- fashioned market- day
---
as every Wintoncestrian
 knows,
---
Up this road
 from the precincts of the city two persons were walking rapidly,
 as if unconscious of the trying ascent-- unconscious through
 preoccupation and not through buoyancy. 
---
They had emerged upon this
 road through a narrow, barred wicket in a high wall a little lower
 down. 
---
They seemed anxious to get out of the sight of the houses and
 of their kind, and
---
this road appeared. 
---
Though they were young
---
, they walked with bowed heads,
 which gait of grief
---
the sun's rays smiled on pitilessly.


---
Their pale faces seemed. 
---
They moved on hand in hand, and".


---
the drooping of their heads being that of Giotto's
" Two Apostles
---
When they had nearly reached the top of the great West Hill
---
the
 clocks in the town struck eight. 
---
Each gave a start at the notes,
 and,
---
walking onward yet a few steps, they reached the first
 milestone, standing whitely on the green margin of the grass, and
 backed by the down, which here was open to the road. 
---
They entered
 upon the turf, and,,.


---
impelled by a force that seemed to overrule their
 will
---
The prospect from this summit was almost unlimited. 
---
they had just left
---
its more prominent buildings
 showing as in an isometric drawing-- among them the broad cathedral
 tower, with its Norman windows and immense length of aisle and nave,

---
till the horizon was lost
 in the radiance of the sun hanging above it
---
Against these far stretches of country rose, in front of the other
 city edifices, a large red- brick building, with level gray roofs,
 and rows of short barred windows bespeaking captivity, the whole
 contrasting greatly by its formalism with the quaint irregularities
 of the Gothic erections. 
---
It was somewhat disguised from the road in
 passing it by yews and evergreen oaks, but
---
it was visible enough up
 here. 
---
from which the pair had lately emerged
---
The wicket was in the
 wall of this structure. 
---
From the middle of the building an ugly
 flat- topped octagonal tower ascended against the east horizon, and

---
viewed from this spot, on its shady side and against the light, it
 seemed the one blot on the city's beauty. 
---
Yet it was with this blot,
 and not with the beauty,.


---
that the two gazers were
---
Their eyes
 were riveted on it. 
---
A few minutes after the hour had struck
 something. 
---
It was a black flag.


---
" Justice" was done, and
---
And the d'Urberville knights
 and dames slept on in their tombs. 
---
The two speechless
 gazers bent themselves down to the earth,
---
as if in prayer, and
 remained thus a long time, absolutely motionless
---
: the flag continued
. 
---
as they had strength
---
As soon, they arose,.
---
