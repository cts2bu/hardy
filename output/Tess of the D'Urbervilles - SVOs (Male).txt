that carried him

---
there was a bias in his gait which inclined him
 somewhat to the left of a straight line. 
---
He occasionally gave a
 smart nod, as if in confirmation of some opinion, though he was not
 thinking of anything in particular. 
---
An empty egg- basket was slung
 upon his arm
---
, the nap of his hat was ruffled,.

---
where his thumb came in taking it off
---
Presently he was met by an elderly parson astride on a gray mare,
 who, as he rode, hummed a wandering tune.

The Maiden


 I


 On an evening in the latter part of May a middle- aged man was walking
 homeward from Shaston to the village of Marlott, in the adjoining
 Vale of Blakemore, or Blackmoor. " Good night t'ee," said the man with the basket.


---
I said' Good night,' and you made reply'_ Good
 night, Sir John_,' as now."


---
when I be plain Jack Durbeyfield, the haggler," he said;
---
I made some little time ago,. 
---
whilst I
 was hunting up pedigrees for the new county history
---
I am Parson
 Tringham, the antiquary, of Stagfoot Lane. 
---
Durbeyfield, that you are the lineal representative of the ancient
 and knightly family of the d'Urbervilles, who derive their descent
 from Sir Pagan d'Urberville, that renowned knight who came from
 Normandy with William the Conqueror,?"


---
so that I may catch

---
Your ancestor was one of the twelve
 knights who assisted the Lord of Estremavilla in Normandy in his
 conquest of Glamorganshire. 
---
In the reign of King John one of them was rich
 enough to give a manor to the Knights Hospitallers; and
---
You declined a little in Oliver
 Cromwell's time, but to no serious extent, and in Charles the
 Second's reign you were made Knights of the Royal Oak for your
 loyalty. 
---
when men were knighted from father
 to son
---
, you would be Sir John now.
---
" Daze my eyes, and is n't there?" said Durbeyfield. 
---
I
 been knocking about, year after year, from pillar,
---
as if I
 was no more than the commonest feller in the parish
---
as he was aware
---
His own investigations had begun on a day in the preceding spring

---
when, having been engaged in tracing the vicissitudes of the
 d'Urberville family, he had observed Durbeyfield's name on his
 waggon, and.


---
till he had no doubt on the subject
---
" At first I resolved
---
not to disturb you with such a useless piece of
 information," said he. 
---
I thought.
---
" Well, I have heard once or twice,' tis true,. 
---
But I took no notice o't,
. 
---
I've got a wold silver spoon, and a wold graven seal
 at home, too;
---
that I and these noble d'Urbervilles were one flesh all the time
---
where he came from
---
Concluding thus, the parson rode on his way, with doubts
 as to his discretion in retailing this curious bit of lore.


---
When he was gone
---
, Durbeyfield walked a few steps in a profound
 reverie, and. 
---
which had been
 pursued by Durbeyfield
---
The latter, on seeing him, held up his hand,
 and
---
the lad quickened his pace and.


---
as he made the announcement
---
And, Durbeyfield, declining from
 his sitting position, luxuriously stretched himself out upon the bank
 among the daisies.


---
The lad stood before Durbeyfield, and.


---
There's not a man in the county
---
' South- Wessex got grander and nobler skillentons in his family than I."

" Oh?
---
, Durbeyfield put his hand in
 his pocket, and.


---
that
 he possessed
---
This made a difference in the young man's estimate of the position.


---
The boy took up the basket, and
---
as he set out the notes of a brass
 band
---
till I come hwome, as I've news to tell
 her I can do for' ee, Sir
 John that I should like for supper" said Durbeyfield. 
---
maybe I'll drive round and."


---
Durbeyfield lay. 
---
which he has passed through
---
Behind him the
 hills are open
---
In men's clubs such celebrations were,
; but
---
if there is n't thy father
 riding hwome in a carriage
---
Durbeyfield was seen
. 
---
with his eyes closed luxuriously
---
I have no pleasure
 in them," than of her juvenile comrades Durbeyfield, leaning back, and, was
 waving his hand above his head, and!"


---
that her father was making himself
 foolish in their eyes
---
He's tired
---
he has got a lift
 home,."


---
" He's got his
 market- nitch. 
---
if you say any jokes
 about him
---
if he had any
---
Tess Durbeyfield at this time of her life was a mere vessel of
 emotion untinctured by experience. 
---
heard further of Durbeyfield in his triumphal
 chariot under the conduct of the ostleress, dancing began. 
---
As there were no men in
 the company
---
; the appearance of the third and
 youngest would hardly have been sufficient to characterize him
---
; there
 was an uncribbed, uncabined aspect in his eyes and attire,. 
---
that he had hardly
---
That he was a desultory tentative student of something
---
and
 everything might only have been predicted of him.


---
He
 unstrapped his knapsack,.


---
The two elder reluctantly left him and
---
_ before we turn in, now I
 have taken the trouble."

" All right-- I'll overtake you and Cuthbert in five minutes; do n't
 stop; I give my word that I will, Felix."

"," he said gallantly, to two or three of
 the girls nearest him, as soon as there was a pause in the dance.

---
The young man, thus invited,; but,
---
as the group were all so new to him
---
he could

---
He took almost the first that came to
 hand, which was not the speaker, as she had expected; nor. 
---
that the village young men, to enter
 the gate, now dropped in quickly,

---
that he must
 leave
---
-- he had been forgetting himself
---
-- he had.

---
As he fell out of the dance his eyes lighted on Tess Durbeyfield
---
He, too, was sorry then
---
that,
 owing to her backwardness, he had not observed her; and
---
with that in
 his mind he left the pasture.


---
On account of his long delay he started in a flying- run down the lane
 westward, and.

---
He had not yet overtaken his brothers, but
---
he paused. 
---
He could see the white figures of the girls in the
 green enclosure whirling about. 
---
when he was among
 them
---
From her position he knew. 
---
he
 yet instinctively felt
---
He wished

---
that he had asked her
---
; he wished. 
---
that he had inquired her name
---
that he felt
---
he had acted stupidly
---
, he dismissed the subject from his mind.




---
as the strange young man had done
---
I saw her lie do'-own in yon'-der green gro'-ove
---
and I'll tell' you where!'



---
As usual, Mrs Durbeyfield was balanced on one foot beside the tub,
. 
---
Mrs Durbeyfield regarding her daughter the while
---
Even now,
 when burdened with a young family, Joan Durbeyfield was a passionate
 lover of tune. 
---
" I'll rock the cradle for' ee, mother
---
( Mrs Durbeyfield
 habitually spoke the dialect
---
father's making such a mommet of himself
 in thik carriage this afternoon
---
Knights o' the
 Royal Oak, our real name being d'Urberville
---
that your father rode home
 in the vlee
---
' Twas on this account; not because he'd been drinking,."


---
Your father learnt it on his way hwome
 from Shaston, and
---
he has been telling me the whole pedigree of the
 matter."


---
" Where is father now?
---
It is fat round his heart,'. 
---
Joan Durbeyfield,, curved a sodden thumb
 and forefinger to the shape of the letter C, and. 
---
"' At the present moment,' he says to your
 father,' all round
 there
---
' As soon meet, so,'"--Mrs Durbeyfield closed her fingers into a circle
 complete--"'off
---
Her father possibly to go behind the eternal
 cloud so soon, notwithstanding this sudden greatness!


---
" But where IS father?"
---
-- he felt--
---
The poor man so rafted after his uplifting by the
 pa'son's news that he went up to Rolliver's half an hour ago. 
---
He do

---
He'll have to
 start shortly after twelve to- night, as the distance is so long."


---
And you as well agreed as he, mother!"


---
Mrs Durbeyfield's jacket and bonnet were already hanging
 slily upon a chair by her side, in readiness for this contemplated
 jaunt, the reason for which the matron deplored more than its
 necessity.


---
to hunt up her shiftless husband at the inn was one of
 Mrs Durbeyfield's still extant enjoyments in the muck and muddle of
 rearing children. 
---
who had just completed his first
 year
---
to sail into difficulty, disaster, starvation, disease, degradation,
 death, thither were these half- dozen little captives under hatches
 compelled to sail with them-- six helpless creatures, who had never
 been asked if they wished for life on any terms, much less if they
 wished for it on such hard conditions as were involved in being of
 the shiftless house of Durbeyfield. 
---
as his song is breezy and pure
---
neither father nor mother reappeared. 
---
what has
 gone wi' father and mother
---
The boy jumped promptly from his seat, and
---
the
 night swallowed him up. 
---
Half an hour passed yet again; neither man,
 woman, nor child returned. 
---
Abraham, like his parents, seemed.


---
;
 a couple more men had elevated themselves on a chest of drawers;
 another rested on the oak- carved" cwoffer"; two on the wash- stand;
 another on the stool; and thus all were, somehow, seated at their
 ease. 
---
Mrs Durbeyfield, having quickly walked hitherward after parting from
 Tess,. 
---
Mrs Durbeyfield was welcomed with glances and nods by the remainder
 of the conclave, and. 
---
where her husband sat
---
He was humming
 absently to himself, in a low tone
---
He was humming
 absently to himself, in a low tone:" I be as good as some folks here
 and there!  I've got a great family vault at Kingsbere- sub- Greenhill,
 and finer skillentons than any man in Wessex!"

" I've something to tell' ee that's come into my head about that-- a
 grand projick!"" Here, John, do n't' ee
 see me?" 
---
while he, looking through her as through a
 window- pane
---
" He's told' ee,
---
" He's told' ee what's happened to us, I suppose?" Ah, that's the secret
---
," said Joan Durbeyfield sagely. 
---
" I've been thinking, on the edge o' The Chase, of the name of
 d'Urberville."


---
" said Sir John.


---
," said Durbeyfield.

---
I do n't
 see why two branches
---
till father and mother be ready
---
as I said to myself to- day when I zeed
 her vamping round parish with the rest" But Joan Durbeyfield must mind." 
---
her father
 and mother rise from their seats
---
He had, in truth, drunk very little-- not a
 fourth of the quantity which a systematic tippler could carry to
 church on a Sunday afternoon without a hitch in his eastings or
 genuflections; but
---
the weakness of Sir John's constitution made
 mountains of his petty sins in this kind. 
---
On reaching the fresh
 air he was sufficiently unsteady to incline the row of three at one
 moment as if they were marching to London, and
---
so they approached by degrees their own door, the
 head of the family bursting suddenly into his former refrain as he
 drew near, as if to fortify his soul at sight of the smallness of
 his present residence--


---
," said Durbeyfield.



---
At half- past one Mrs
 Durbeyfield came into the large bedroom where Tess and all her
 little brothers and sisters slept.


---
The poor man ca n't go
---
Mrs Durbeyfield looked unequal to the emergency. 
---
Little Abraham was
 aroused from his deep sleep in a corner of the same apartment, and

---
as if he could not believe
---
that at
 that hour, when to be in shelter and
 at rest, he was called upon
---
Abraham, as he more fully awoke( for he had moved in a
 sort of trance so far),; of this tree that looked
 like a raging tiger springing from a lair; of that which resembled a
 giant's head.


---
he said in a preparatory tone, after a silence.


---
His sister became abruptly still, and. 
---
so that his sister's abstraction was of no
 account
---
He asked. 
---
But ever and anon
 his childish prattle recurred to what impressed his imagination
 even more deeply than the wonders of creation. 
---
" I do n't know; but
---
I think so. 
---
" Well, father would n't have coughed and,
 and; and And
---
as he does
---
if he wished
---
that he could
 not fall, and
---
The groan had proceeded from her father's poor horse Prince. 
---
his
 life's blood was spouting in a stream, and
---
Prince
 also stood firm and motionless as long as he could;.


---
till he suddenly
 sank down in a heap
---
By this time the mail- cart man had joined her, and. 
---
But he was already dead, and,

---
, the mail- cart man
 returned to his own animal, which was uninjured.


---
," he said. 
---
" I am bound,. 
---
I'll send somebody. 
---
as I can
---
He mounted and;. 
---
; his eyes half open, the hole in his chest
 looking scarcely large enough to have let out all that had animated
 him.


---
, the furrows of fifty years were
 extemporized on his young face.


---
" Why, I danced and!"
---
that I was such a fool
---
that the
 driver of the mail- car had been as good as his word
---
A farmer's
 man from near Stourcastle came up,. 
---
He was
 and
---
All was now hoisted into the
 waggon he had formerly hauled, and with his hoofs in the air, and his
 shoes shining in the setting sunlight
---
, he retraced the eight or nine
 miles to Marlott.


---
that the knacker and tanner would give only a
 very few shillings for Prince's carcase because of his decrepitude
---
,
 Durbeyfield rose to the occasion.


---
" No," said he stoically,". 
---
I wo n't sell his old body
---
He've served me well
 in his lifetime, and
---
I wo n't part from him now."


---
He worked harder the next day in digging a grave for Prince in the
 garden than he had worked for months to grow a crop for his family.

---
, Durbeyfield and his wife tied a rope round
 the horse and. 
---
" Is he gone to heaven?"
---
Then Durbeyfield began, and
---
Durbeyfield was
---
; he had good strength to work at times; but
---
,
 having been unaccustomed to the regular toil of the day- labourer,
 he was not particularly persistent.


---
that there is a very
 rich Mrs d'Urberville living on the outskirts
---
that this Mrs d'Urberville was a lady of unequalled virtues and
 charity
---
where he
 sat in the background
---
His reasons for staying away were worse to Tess than her own
 objections to going. 
---
Tess Durbeyfield's route on this memorable morning lay amid the
 north- eastern undulations of the Vale in which she had been born, and
 in which her life had unfolded. 
---
: Joan Durbeyfield was simply an additional one, and that not
 the eldest, to her own long family of waiters on Providence.


---
when her father had owned cows
---
It was not a manorial home in the
 ordinary sense, with fields, and pastures, and a grumbling farmer,
 out of whom the owner had to squeeze an income for himself and his
 family by hook or by crook. 
---
, not planted by the hand of man
---
Simple Tess Durbeyfield stood at gaze, in a half- alarmed attitude,
 on the edge of the gravel sweep. 
---
when he said
---
that our shambling John Durbeyfield was
 the only really lineal representative of the old d'Urberville family
 existing in the county, or near it
---
; he might have added,,
---
what he knew
 very well
---
then he was himself. 
---
When old Mr Simon Stoke, latterly deceased, had made his fortune as
 an honest merchant( some said money- lender) in the North
---
, he decided

---
in doing this he felt the necessity of
 recommencing with a name that would not too readily identify him with
 the smart tradesman of the past, and. 
---
families appertaining to the quarter of England
 in which he proposed to settle
---
ruined, he considered
---
that_ d'Urberville_
 looked and: and
---
d'Urberville
 accordingly was annexed to his own name for himself and his heirs
 eternally. 
---
Yet he was not an extravagant- minded man in this, and
---
It was that of a
 tall young man, smoking.


---
He had an almost swarthy complexion, with full lips, badly moulded,
 though red and smooth, above which was a well- groomed black moustache
 with curled points,. 
---
though his age could not be more than three- or
 four- and- twenty
---
Despite the touches of barbarism in his contours,
 there was a singular force in the gentleman's face, and in his bold
 rolling eye.


---
" Well, my Beauty, what can I do for you?"
---
he, coming forward
---
I am
 Mr d'Urberville. 
---
This embodiment of a d'Urberville and a namesake differed even more
 from what Tess had expected than the house and grounds had differed.

---
" I came."


---
" I am afraid you can not see her
---
Why, sir, Tess's sense of a certain ludicrousness in her errand was now
 so strong that, notwithstanding her awe of him, and her general
 discomfort at being here, her rosy lips curved towards a smile,
 much to the attraction of the swarthy Alexander.


---
I fear" Never mind; I like foolish things.  Try again, my dear," said he
 kindly.


---
" Our names are worn away to Durbeyfield; but
---
we
 have an old seal, marked with a ramping lion on a shield, and a
 castle over him. 
---
," said he blandly. 
---
Alec looked at Tess, in a way that made her
 blush a little. 
---
as he spoke
---
responding to further inquiries
 told him.


---
a long while before he returns past Trantridge Cross
---
the young
 man was pressing, and
---
He conducted
 her about the lawns, and flower- beds, and conservatories; and thence
 to the fruit- garden and greenhouses, where he asked her if she liked
 strawberries.


---
D'Urberville began,; and,

---
as he stooped
---
, he stood up and.


---
he insisted; and
---
he gathered blossoms and.
---
no
 more he himself tucked a bud or two into her hat, and
---
At last,
 looking at his watch, he said,". 
---
I'll see what grub I
."


---
Stoke d'Urberville took her back to the lawn and into the tent, where
 he left her, soon reappearing with a basket of light luncheon, which
 he put before her himself. 
---
" he asked.


---
He watched her pretty and unconscious munching through the skeins of
 smoke that pervaded the tent, and Tess Durbeyfield did not divine,
 as she innocently looked down at the roses in her bosom, that there
 behind the blue narcotic haze was potentially the" tragic mischief"
 of her drama-- one who stood fair to be the blood- red ray in the
 spectrum of her young life. 
---
he asked, the drive till they were out of sight of the house.


---
as he accompanied her along

---
" I-- killed him!"
---
For a moment-- only for a moment--, between the tall rhododendrons and conifers,, he inclined his face towards her as if-- but
---
, no: he
 thought better of it, and.


---
coveted that day
 by the wrong man, and not by some other man, the right and desired
 one in all respects--
---
In the ill- judged execution of the well- judged plan of things the
 call seldom produces the comer, the man to love rarely coincides with
 the hour for loving. 
---
When d'Urberville got back to the tent he sat down astride on a
 chair, reflecting, with a pleased gleam in his face. 
---
Then he broke
 into a loud laugh.


---
" Mrs d'Urberville says--. 
---
" And did he own' ee?"


---
" Well-- he called me Coz."


---
Jacky-- he called her Coz!"
---
" Well, he spoke to his mother, of course, and
---
" Mrs d'Urberville wrote it. 
---
Mrs d'Urberville's son had called on horseback,. 
---
He had wished

---
finally, in the name of his mother, to manage the old lady's fowl- farm or not; the lad hitherto superintended. 
---
d'Urberville says
---
; he knows. 
---
He is very
 much interested in' ee-- truth to tell."


---
" It is very good of him;" and
---
" He is a mighty handsome man!"


---
when he put his hand up to his
 mistarshers
---
Mother, why did our grand relation keep on putting his
 hand up to his mistarshers?"


---
cried Mrs Durbeyfield, with parenthetic
 admiration.


---
I seed it!" Perhaps to show his diamond ring," murmured Sir John, dreamily, from
 his chair.


---
" He's
 struck wi' her
---
He called her Coz! 
---
He'll marry
 her, most likely, and; and
---
John Durbeyfield had more conceit than energy or health, and
---
this
 supposition was pleasant to him.


---
what young Mr d'Urberville means
---
," he admitted;
"
---
sure enough he mid have serious thoughts about improving his
 blood by linking on to the old line. 
---
Her father coughed in his chair.


---
d'Urberville being there
---
Mrs Durbeyfield did not promise. 
---
that Mrs d'Urberville was glad of her decision, and
---
Mrs d'Urberville's handwriting seemed rather
 masculine.


---
who sings with a clear- voiced
 conviction that he at least knows the correct time of day, the rest
 preserving silence as if equally convinced that he is mistaken
---
" Well, yes," said Mrs Durbeyfield; and
---
But I think
---
" Very well; I suppose
---
Mrs Durbeyfield was only too delighted at this tractability.

---
Her mother's pride in the girl's appearance led her,
 like a painter from his easel, and.


---
, Mrs Durbeyfield hung, and. 
---
" he'll
 never have the heart. 
---
However, as the moment for drew nigh,, a slight misgiving
 found place in Joan Durbeyfield's mind. 
---
" Going to work, my dears, for our rich relation, and help get enough
 money for a new horse," said Mrs Durbeyfield pacifically.


---
" Goodbye, my maid," said Sir John,. 
---
as he suspended his nap
---
my young friend will like such
 a comely sample of his own blood
---
cried Lady Durbeyfield.


---
He'll adorn it better than a poor lammicken
 feller like myself. 
---
he shall hae it for a hundred. 
---
tell'n he shall hae it for fifty-- for
 twenty pound! 
---
Well, I'll take less, when
 I come.  But
 I wo n't stand upon trifles-- I wo n't take a penny less!"

," said Mrs
 Durbeyfield. 
---
" Yes, I see it yonder!"


---
The driver was a young man
 of three- or four- and- twenty, with a cigar between his teeth;
---
wearing
 a dandy cap, drab jacket, breeches of the same hue, white neckcloth,
 stick- up collar, and brown driving- gloves-- in short, he was the
 handsome, horsey young buck who had visited Joan a week or two before
 to get her answer about Tess.


---
Mrs Durbeyfield clapped her hands like a child. 
---
The young
 man dismounted, and. 
---
; he
 mounted beside her, and. 
---
There were tears also in Joan Durbeyfield's eyes. 
---
her husband asked her.


---
Oh, I do n't know exactly
---
whether the gentleman
 is really a good- hearted young man and choice over her as his
 kinswoman
---
to ha' done that," snored Sir John.


---
Joan Durbeyfield always managed:". 
---
if he do n't marry her afore he
 will after. 
---
For that he's all afire wi' love for her any eye.
---
Having mounted beside her, Alec d'Urberville drove rapidly along
 the crest of the first hill, chatting compliments to Tess as they
 went, the cart with her box being left far behind. 
---
Ever since the accident with her father's horse Tess Durbeyfield,
 courageous, had been exceedingly timid on
 wheels; the least irregularity of motion startled her. 
---
D'Urberville looked round upon her,.


---
his lips to smile slowly of
 themselves
---
," he answered, after another whiff or two,
---
Why, I always go down at
 full gallop. 
---
," he said,
---
" Ah shaking his head," there are two to be reckoned with.

---
If any living man can manage this horse
---
any living man can do it
---
" Well, I do n't.  I can: I
 wo n't say-- but if such has the power, I am
 he."

" Why do you have such a horse?"


---
that the
 horse, whether of her own will or of his( the latter being the more
 likely), knew so well the reckless performance expected of her that
 she hardly required a hint from behind
---
said d'Urberville.

"' Tis truth.
---
whether he were man
 or woman, stick or stone, in her involuntary hold on him
---
" Now then, again!" said d'Urberville.

"
---
," he retorted.


---
He loosened rein, and
---
D'Urberville
 turned his face to her, and
---
at which he urged the horse anew, and
---
her
 large eyes staring at him like those of a wild animal
---
" Nothing, dear Tess," he replied.


---
Oh, I do n't know-- very well
---
"; I do n't mind!"
---
He drew rein, and
---
he was on the point of imprinting
 the desired salute,. 
---
His arms being occupied with the reins
---
He was inexorable, and
---
d'Urberville gave her the
 kiss of mastery. 
---
No sooner had he done so,. 
---
that had been touched by his lips
---
His ardour was nettled at the
 sight,.


---
said the young man.


---
he resumed,. 
---
his injured tone
 still remaining,
---
as he flourished the whip anew
---
D'Urberville
 pulled up, and but
---
he would get it for her
---
",," he
 said,. 
---
" No, sir revealing the red and ivory of her mouth;" not again, if I know it!"


---
Her strategic silence confirmed his suspicion.


---
Then d'Urberville cursed and
---
swore at her, and called her everything
 he could think of for the trick. 
---
he tried
. 
---
But he could not do this short of injuring her.


---
D'Urberville's bad temper cleared up at sight of hers; and
---
he laughed
 heartily.


---
," he said. 
---
I'll never do it any more against your will. 
---
d'Urberville exhibited a sort of fierce distress at
 the sight of the tramping he had driven her to undertake by his
 misdemeanour. 
---
he
 had forfeited her confidence for the time, and
---
that each succeeding householder had
 carefully shaped with his spade
---
" Mrs d'Urberville wants the fowls as usual but."


---
But he is hardly so

---
lively to- day, is he? 
---
He is
---
" I hope.  He is alarmed at being handled by a stranger,
 I suppose. But they will soon get used to you."


---
At the end of the ceremony Mrs d'Urberville abruptly asked Tess,
 wrinkling and twitching her face into undulations,""


---
I had a lad who did it
 very well, but
---
he has left. 
---
I want;
 as I can not see them, I like to hear them, and we teach'em airs
 that way. 
---
" Mr d'Urberville whistled to'em this morning, ma'am
---
The girl's surprise at
 Mrs d'Urberville's manner was not great; for since seeing the size of
 the house she had expected no more. 
---
Mrs d'Urberville
 was not the first mother compelled to love her offspring resentfully,
 and.



---
It was Alec
 d'Urberville, whom she had not set eyes on since he had conducted
 her the day before to the door of the gardener's cottage where she
 had lodgings.


---
" Upon my honour!" cried he,". 
---
He suited the action to the word, and." 
---
" Now try," said d'Urberville.


---
But he persisted in his demand, and
---
He encouraged her with" Try again!"


---
Now I have started you
---
There-- I said I would not come near you; and, in spite of such
 temptation as never before fell to mortal man, I'll keep my
 word...  Tess" I do n't know much of her yet, sir."

" You'll find her so
---
that Tess Durbeyfield had
 undertaken
---
which that young man
 and by jestingly
 calling her his cousin-- removed much of her
 original shyness of him, without, however, implanting any feeling
 which could engender shyness of a new and tenderer kind
---
d'Urberville's room was no such onerous business
---
Mrs d'Urberville slept in a large four- post bedstead hung with heavy
 damask curtains, and
---
Thereupon her whistling became so disjointed that the
 listener, if such there were, must have discovered her suspicion of
 his presence. 
---
Alec d'Urberville had evidently
 thought better of his freak.




---
under pressure from matrons not much older than herself-- for a
 field- man's wages being as high at twenty- one as at forty, marriage

---
He lived in an out- of- the- way nook of the townlet, and
---
in
 trying to find her course thither her eyes fell upon Mr d'Urberville
.


---
I am rather out of her books just now, but" he said.


---
" I'll see you again
---
," said he over her shoulder.


---
he explained. 
---
which be their
 fancy- men
---
Alec d'Urberville was standing there alone.

---
He beckoned to her, and
---
I really think."


---
I
 will wait no longer
---
I have only a saddle- horse here to- day; but and
---
I'll hire a trap, and."


---
He had not put himself forward into the light, but
---
some of them
 had perceived him, and
---
his presence led to a slight pause and a
 consideration of how the time was flying. 
---
as he had
---
; some of the more careless women also were wandering in their
 gait-- to wit, a dark virago, Car Darch, dubbed Queen of Spades, till
 lately a favourite of d'Urberville's; Nancy, her sister, nicknamed
 the Queen of Diamonds; and the young married woman who had already
 tumbled down. 
---
The rather too inclusive speech brought down a torrent of
 vituperation from other quarters upon fair Tess's unlucky head,
 particularly from the Queen of Diamonds, who having stood in the
 relations to d'Urberville that Car had also been suspected of, united
 with the latter against the common enemy. 
---
Alec d'Urberville looked round
 upon them.


---
if I had know you was of that sort, I would n't have!"

" he asked.


---
, in truth, he did
 not require any. 
---
Having heard their voices while yet some way off he
 had ridden creepingly forward, and.


---
He bent over
 towards her. 
---
" Jump up behind me," he whispered," and
---
Each pedestrian could see
 no halo but his or her own, which never deserted the head- shadow,
; but
---
XI


 The twain cantered along for some time without speech, Tess as she
 clung to him still panting in her triumph, yet in other respects
 dubious. 
---
he sometimes rose, and
---
though her seat
 was precarious enough despite her tight hold of him
---
which Alec accordingly did
---
" Neatly done,?" he said by and by.


---
Nevertheless, Alec did not object to
 that confession. 
---
He knew.

---
In that moment of oblivion her head sank gently against
 him.


---
D'Urberville stopped the horse,.


---
In his ticklish position he nearly lost his
 balance and.


---
he rode
---
he said. 
---
" I mean no harm-- only to keep
 you from falling."


---
" I beg your pardon,
 sir
---
" I wo n't pardon you. 
---
" he burst out,"? 
---
what am I,
---
I wo n't stand it!"


---
" I'll leave you to- morrow, sir."


---
, I ask once more,
? 
---
that I love you
---
May n't I treat you as a lover?"


---
I do n't know
---
writhing uneasily on
 her seat, looked far ahead, and murmured,"-- I wish--
---
how
 can I say yes or no when--"


---
He settled the matter by clasping his arm and
---
as he desired
---
till he had stolen a cursory kiss
---
He sprang down on the other side.


---
" replied Alec,. 
---
" He's had enough of it for to- night."


---
He turned the horse's head into the bushes,.


---
," he said. 
---
He took a few steps away from her, but,. 
---
By the bye,
 Tess, your father has a new cob to- day
---
Somebody gave it to him."


---
D'Urberville nodded.


---
I did n't know
---
" I almost wish--!"


---
yes, I almost wish it
---
I'm grateful
---
" But I fear
---
I do not--"

---
till I
 come
---
" he asked.


---
He touched her with his fingers, which sank into her as into down.

---
when I started
---
I
 did n't know, and."


---
I was going
---
He pulled off a
 light overcoat that he had worn, and.

---
," he continued. 
---
" Now, my pretty,
 rest there; I shall soon be back again."


---
he plunged into the
 webs of vapour which by this time formed veils between the trees
---
as he ascended the
 adjoining slope
---
till his movements were no louder than the hopping
 of a bird, and
---
In the meantime Alec d'Urberville had pushed on up the slope. 
---
He
 had, in fact, ridden quite at random for over an hour, moonlit person than to any
 wayside object. 
---
,
 he did not hasten his search for landmarks. 
---
A clamber over the
 hill into the adjoining vale brought him to the fence of a highway
 whose contours he recognized, which settled the question of their
 whereabouts. 
---
D'Urberville thereupon turned back; but
---
He was obliged, and. 
---
from which he had started
---
Roaming
 up and down, round and round, he at length heard a slight movement of
 the horse close at hand; and
---
the sleeve of his overcoat unexpectedly
 caught his foot.


---
The obscurity was now so great that he could
 see absolutely nothing but a pale nebulousness at his feet, which
 represented the white muslin figure he had left upon the dead leaves.

---
D'Urberville stooped; and. 
---
till her breath
 warmed his face, and
---
in a moment his cheek was in contact with hers
---
Perhaps, like
 that other god, he was talking,
 or
---
he was pursuing, or
---
he was in a journey, or
---
he was sleeping and
.


---
the wrong man the
 woman, the wrong woman the man, many thousand years of analytical
 philosophy have failed
---
Doubtless some of Tess d'Urberville's mailed ancestors
 rollicking home from a fray had dealt the same measure even more
 ruthlessly towards peasant girls of their time. 
---
It was a Sunday morning in late October, about four months after Tess
 Durbeyfield's arrival at Trantridge, and some few weeks subsequent to
 the night ride in The Chase. 
---
in a few minutes man and horse stopped beside her.


---
said d'Urberville, with
 upbraiding breathlessness;" on a Sunday morning, too, when people
 were all in bed! 
---
I only discovered it by accident, and
---
I have been
. 
---
I have followed like a
 madman,,."


---
I sha n't come back
---
D'Urberville mechanically lit a cigar, and
---
He had quite forgotten his struggle to kiss her when,
 in the early summer, they had driven in the opposite direction along
 the same road. 
---
" I thought you wouldn't-- I said so! " he coldly asked.


---
" I was only thinking,
---
that I was born over there
---
" I wish-- there or anywhere else!"


---
I had never been born
---
that I'll swear
---
If I had gone for love
---
if I had ever
 sincerely loved you, if I loved you still, I should not so loathe and
 hate myself for my weakness as I do now!
---
He shrugged his shoulders. 
---
" I did n't understand your meaning."


---
I could knock you out of
 the gig! 
---
," he said,;
---
" Very well laughing" I am sorry to wound you. 
---
I did

---
-- I admit it." 
---
He dropped into some little bitterness:". 
---
as he
 continued
---
I am ready to pay to the uttermost farthing. 
---
him to drive her further
---
D'Urberville alighted, and

---
her eye just
 lingering in his; and
---
Alec d'Urberville removed his cigar, bent towards her, and said--

" You are not going to turn away like that, dear! 
---
while he imprinted a kiss upon her cheek-- half
 perfunctorily,
---
he kissed the other side,
 his lips touching cheeks that were damp and smoothly chill as the
 skin of the mushrooms in the fields around
---
He emitted a laboured breath,.


---
as if the scene were getting rather
 oppressive to his heart, or to his conscience, or to his gentility
---
He leapt up lightly,.


---
though the sun's lower limb was just free of
 the hill, his rays, ungenial and peering
---
, however, some footsteps approached behind her, the
 footsteps of a man; and owing to the briskness of his advance. 
---
he was
 close at her heels and
---
He appeared, and. 
---
He asked
 in a business- like manner.


---
if he should take her basket,
---
" I have said so, often.  I have never really and truly
 loved you, and I think I never can."  If I did love you, I may have the best o' causes for letting you know
 it.  But I do n't."

 I have no
 reason for flattering you now, and I can say plainly
.  You can hold your own for
 beauty against any woman of these parts, gentle or
 simple; I say it to you as a practical man and
 well- wisher.  Upon my soul, I do n't
 I made up my mind as soon as I saw-- what I ought to
; and I wo n't come."

" It is early!"
---
he said cheerfully.


---
The man turned,, to an
 opening at the roadside leading into a pasture. 
---
as he spoke
---
," he added,"
---
As he had her basket
---
He set down her basket and the tin pot, and
---
as if this
 man had known her recent history
---
; yet he was a total stranger.


---
Having finished his text he picked up her basket, and
---
He shook his head.


---
," he said. 
---
" I have
 walked hundreds of miles this past summer,.

---
I leave their application to the hearts of the people who read' em."


---
" I think
---
he replied in a trade voice.

---
I must put one there-- one that it
 will be good for dangerous young females like yerself to heed. 
---
It was with a sudden flush that she read and realized
 what was to be the inscription he was now halfway through--


      
---
to ask for edification on these things of moment,
 there's a very earnest good man going to preach
---
he's a good man, and
---
he'll expound as
 well as any parson I know. 
---
he began the work in me."


---
A plume of smoke soared up suddenly from her father's chimney,. 
---
it being Sunday
 morning, when he felt justified in lying an additional half- hour.


---
" He's not my cousin, and
---
he's not going."


---
him to marry' ee
---
continued Mrs Durbeyfield, ready to burst into tears of
 vexation. 
---
your poor weak
 father with his heart clogged like a dripping- pan. 
---
what
 he has given us--
---
because we were his kin
---
if
 he's not
---
But, it must have been done because of his love for' ee. 
---
him to marry
---
He marry HER! 
---
On
 matrimony he had never once said a word. 
---
And what if he had? 
---
he took of her helplessness
---
winced before him succumbed to adroit advantages
 then, temporarily blinded by his ardent
 manners,
---
he was dust and ashes to her, and.


---
The event of Tess Durbeyfield's return from the manor of her bogus
 kinsfolk was rumoured abroad,. 
---
that it was a gift from him
---
where only old men and women came, and
---
His present aspect, coupled with the lack of all human forms in the
 scene, explained the old- time heliolatries in a moment. 
---
that
 was brimming with interest for him
---
His light, a little later, broke though chinks of cottage shutters,
 throwing stripes like red- hot pokers upon cupboards, chests of
 drawers, and other furniture within; and awakening harvesters who
 were not already astir.


---
Two groups, one of men and lads, the other of women, had come down
 the lane just at the hour,. 
---
mainly women, but some
 of them men in print shirts trousers supported round their
 waists by leather straps,.


---
as if they were a pair of eyes in the small of his back
---
A field- man is a
 personality afield
---
It is Tess Durbeyfield
---
, the men plying a stone jar freely, and.


---
Tess Durbeyfield had been one of the last.

---
The men considerately turned their faces towards the
 other end of the field,;
---
The harvest- men rose from the shock of corn, and. 
---
at which
 her father's sense of the antique nobility of his family was highest,
 and
---
his sensitiveness to the smudge most pronounced,
---
for he had just returned from his weekly
 booze at Rolliver's Inn
---
No parson should come inside his door
---
, he
 declared,. 
---
He locked the door
 and.


---
What's his name going?"


---
so forth--"and do sign him with the sign
 of the Cross
---
In the blue of the morning that fragile
 soldier and servant breathed his last, and
---
he was a
 new- comer, and. 
---
him coming homeward
---
He expressed his willingness to listen, and
---
-- will it be just the same for
 him?"


---
as if you had baptized him
---
he
 should have been called in for
---
that a job had been unskilfully botched by his
 customers among themselves
---
Having the natural feelings of a tradesman at finding, he was disposed. 
---
Yet the
 dignity of the girl, the strange tenderness in her voice, combined
 to affect his nobler impulses-- or rather those that he had left in
 him after ten years of endeavour to graft technical belief on actual
 scepticism. 
---
The man and the ecclesiastic fought within him, and
---
the
 victory fell to the man.


---
," he said,
---
himself cornered
---
Hearing of the baby's illness, he
 had conscientiously gone to the house, and, unaware that the refusal to admit him had come from Tess's
 father and not from Tess
---
, he could not allow the plea of necessity
 for its irregular administration.


---
," he said.


---
Well-- I would willingly do so. 
---
" Really I must not."


---
He withdrew it,.


---
" Then I do n't like you!"
---
I'll never come to your
 church no more!"


---
" Perhaps it will be just the same to him?... 
---
How the Vicar reconciled his answer with the strict notions he
 supposed himself to hold on these subjects it is beyond a layman's
 power to tell, though not to excuse. 
---
, he said in
 this case also--

."


---
buried by lantern- light,
 at the cost of a shilling and a pint of beer to the sexton, in that
 shabby corner of God's allotment where He lets the nettles grow,
 and where all unbaptized infants, notorious drunkards, suicides,
 and others of the conjecturally damned are laid
---
Durbeyfield's experience was of this incapacitating kind. 
---
which d'Urberville had given
 her
---
It is the----th, the day that poor Tess Durbeyfield died"
---
( for they were not Blakemore men,)
---
not only that d'Urberville, like Babylon, had fallen,
 but
---
While waiting, however,
 there came along a farmer in his spring cart,. 
---
Though he was a stranger
 to her
---
He was going to
 Weatherbury, and by accompanying him thither she could walk the
 remainder of the distance instead of travelling in the van by way of
 Casterbridge.


---
Children of Men... bless ye the Lord,!"


---
while her father did nothing of the kind
---
Tess Durbeyfield, then, in good heart, and full of zest for life,
 descended the Egdon slopes lower and lower towards the dairy of her
 pilgrimage.


---
One of these was a sturdy middle- aged man-- whose long white" pinner"
 was somewhat finer and cleaner than the wraps of the others, and
 whose jacket underneath had a presentable marketing aspect-- the
 master- dairyman, of whom she was in quest, his double character as
 a working milker and butter maker here during six days, and on the
 seventh as a man in shining broad- cloth in his family pew at church,
 being so marked as to have inspired a rhyme:


              Dairyman Dick
              All the week:--
     
---
he went across to her.


---
he received her warmly;.


---
for in reality he had not been aware of Mrs Durbeyfield's existence

---
" Oh-- ay, as a lad I knowed your part o' the country very well," he
 said terminatively. 
---
" Though I've never been there since. 
---
But, Lord, I took no notice of the old
 woman's ramblings, not I."


---
he surveyed her up and down.

---
," he said indifferently,. 
---
what I hain't

---
," he pursued,. 
---
The milkers formed quite a little battalion of men and maids, the
 men operating on the hard- teated animals, the maids on the kindlier
 natures. 
---
of the herd the
 master- dairyman milked six or eight with his own hands, unless away
 from home. 
---
his
 journey- milkmen being
---
for more or less casually hired, he would not
 entrust this half- dozen to their treatment, lest, from indifference,

---
he had just finished off,
---
because he saw certain brimstone
 flames around him, one of the male milkers said--


---
Once there was an old aged man over at
 Mellstock-- William Dewy by name-- one of the family that used to do
 a good deal of business as tranters over there-- Jonathan, do ye

---
Well, this man was a coming home along from a
 wedding, where he had been playing his fiddle, one fine moonlight
 night, and
---
for shortness' sake he took a cut across Forty- acres, a
 field lying that way, where a bull was out to grass. 
---
Though
 I do think I knowed the man by sight as well as I know my own brother, in
 a manner of speaking.  though William
 runned his best, and had n't MUCH drink in him( considering' twas a
 wedding, and the folks well off)
---
, he found. 
---
he'd never reach the fence
 and
---
Well, as a last thought, he
 pulled out his fiddle, and. 
---
as he runned
---
But no sooner
 did William stop his playing and. 
---
Well, William had; and
---
that nobody would come that way for hours, and he so leery and tired

---
When he had scraped till about four
 o'clock
---
he felt, and
---
that he verily would have
---
he
 said to himself,'!
---
I'm a done man.' 
---
Well, then he called to

---
how he'd seen
---
it came into his head to
. 
---
So he broke into the' Tivity Hymm, just
 as at Christmas carol- singing; when, lo and behold, down went the
 bull on his bended knees, in his ignorance, just as if' twere the
 true' Tivity night and hour. 
---
as his horned friend were down
---
As soon,
 William turned,. 
---
before the praying bull had got on his feet again
---
William used.... 
---
that he'd seen, but never such a fool as that bull looked when
 he found his pious feelings had been played upon, and' twas not
 Christmas Eve
---
a man look a fool
 a good many times
---
that was the man's name
---
I can tell you to a foot where's he a- lying in Mellstock Churchyard
 at this very moment-- just between the second yew- tree and the north
 aisle."


---
, no notice
 was taken, except that the narrator seemed to think it might imply
 scepticism as to his tale.


---
I knowed the man well."


---
" Oh yes; I have no doubt of it
---
his burying his
 head so persistently in the flank of the milcher
---
why he should be addressed as" sir" even by the dairyman
 himself
---
; he remained under the
 cow long enough to have milked three, uttering a private ejaculation
 now and.


---
then, as if he could not get on
---
He wore the ordinary white
 pinner and leather leggings of a dairy- farmer when milking, and
---
his
 boots were clogged with the mulch of the yard; but
---
this was all his
 local livery. 
---
But the details of his aspect were temporarily thrust aside by
 the discovery that he was one whom she had seen before. 
---
that he was the pedestrian who had joined in the
 club- dance at Marlott-- the passing stranger who had come
---
recognizing her also, he should by some means discover her story.

---
that since their first and only encounter his mobile
 face had grown more thoughtful, and
---
where it began upon his cheeks, and
---
Under his linen milking- pinner he wore a dark
 velveteen jacket, cord breeches and gaiters, and a starched white
 shirt. 
---
what
 he was
---
He might with equal probability have been an eccentric
 landowner or a gentlemanly ploughman. 
---
That he was but a novice at
 dairy work she had realized in a moment, from the time he had spent
 upon the milking of one cow.


---
Mr Angel Clare-- he, and never says much to us. 
---
He is a pa'son's son, and. 
---
He is
 the dairyman's pupil--. 
---
He
 has learnt sheep- farming at another place, and
---
he's now mastering
 dairy- work.... 
---
Yes, he is quite the gentleman- born. 
---
His father is
 the Reverent Mr Clare at Emminster-- a good many miles from here."


---
" Oh-- I have heard of him," said her companion, now awake. 
---
" A very
 earnest clergyman, is he not?"


---
" Yes-- that he is-- the earnestest man in all Wessex
---
All his sons, except our Mr Clare, be made
 pa'sons too."


---
why the present Mr
 Clare was not made a parson like his brethren, and
---
XVIII


 Angel Clare rises out of the past not altogether as a distinct
 figure, but as an appreciative voice, a long regard of fixed,
 abstracted eyes, and a mobility of mouth somewhat too small and
 delicately lined for a man's, though with an unexpectedly firm close
 of the lower lip now and then; enough to do away with any inference
 of indecision. 
---
Nevertheless, something nebulous, preoccupied, vague,
 in his bearing and regard, marked him as one who probably had no very
 definite aim or concern about his material future. 
---
Yet as a lad
 people had said of him.


---
that he was one who might do anything if he
 tried
---
He was the youngest son of his father, a poor parson at the other end
 of the county, and.


---
his object being
,
 with a view either to the Colonies or the tenure of a home- farm,
---
His entry into the ranks of the agriculturists and breeders was a
 step in the young man's career which had been anticipated neither
 by himself nor by others.


---
though he was the single one of them
---
when he had left school and
---
Some two or three years before Angel's appearance at the Marlott
 dance, on a day was pursuing his studies
 at home, a parcel came to the Vicarage from the local bookseller's,
. 
---
found, read a few pages; whereupon he jumped up
 from his seat and.


---
he asked peremptorily,.


---
" Not by me, or any one belonging to me, I am happy to say.
---
The shopkeeper looked into his order- book.


---
," he said. 
---
" It was ordered by Mr
 Angel Clare, and."


---
Mr Clare winced. 
---
as if he had been struck
---
He went home pale and
 dejected, and.


---
" Look into this book, my boy," he said. 
---
" I ordered it
---
," said Angel simply.


---
" How can I? 
---
" Yes-- moral enough; I do n't deny that. 
---
"," said the son, with
 anxious thought upon his face,". 
---
that one of his own flesh and blood could come to this
---
He was

---
if Angel were not going to

---
what was the use of sending him to Cambridge? 
---
The
 University as a step to anything but ordination seemed, to this man
 of fixed ideas, a preface without a volume. 
---
He was a man not merely
 religious, but devout
---
; a firm believer-- elusively construed by theological thimble- riggers in the Church and
 out of it, but in the old and ardent sense of the Evangelical school:
 one who could


               Indeed opine
         That the Eternal and Divine
         Did, eighteen centuries ago
         In very truth...


 Angel's father tried argument, persuasion, entreaty.


---
I should like once for
 all, that I should prefer I fear I could not
 conscientiously do so.  I love the Church.
 I shall always have the warmest affection for her.  I
 can not honestly be ordained her minister,,."

 No, father; I can not underwrite Article Four( leave alone the rest),
 taking it' in the literal and grammatical sense'; and, therefore, I ca n't be a parson in the present state
 of affairs," said Angel. 
---
His father grieved so deeply that it made Angel quite ill to see him.


---
his father repeated.


---
" Why, that it may be used for the honour and glory of man, father."


---
if Angel had persevered
---
Perhaps he might have gone to Cambridge like
 his brothers. 
---
so
 rooted was the idea in his mind that perseverance began to appear to
 the sensitive son akin to an intent to misappropriate a trust, and
 wrong the pious heads of the household, who had been and were, as his
 father had hinted,.


---
I will do without Cambridge
---
"," said Angel at last. 
---
" I feel."


---
that I
 have no right to go there in the circumstances
---
He spent years and years in desultory studies,
 undertakings, and meditations
---
; he began. 
---
he increasingly despised. 
---
Even the
" good old family"( to use a favourite phrase of a late local worthy)
 had no aroma for him. 
---
when he went to
 live in London to see what the world was like, and
---
with a view to
 practising a profession or business there, he was carried off his
 head, and
---
nearly entrapped by a woman much older than himself
---
As a balance to these austerities,, though
 luckily he escaped not greatly the worse for the experience.


---
Early association with country solitudes had bred in him an
 unconquerable, and almost unreasonable, aversion to modern town life,
 and shut him out from such success as he might have aspired to by
 following a mundane calling in the impracticability of the spiritual
 one. 
---
to be done; he had wasted many valuable
 years; and. 
---
having an acquaintance, it occurred to Angel
---
Farming, either in the Colonies, America, or
 at home-- farming, at any rate, after becoming well qualified for the
 business by a careful apprenticeship-- that was a vocation which would
 probably afford an independence without the sacrifice of what he
 valued even more than a competency-- intellectual liberty.


---
So we find Angel Clare at six- and- twenty here at Talbothays as a
 student of kine, and, as there were no houses near at hand in which
 he could get a comfortable lodging, a boarder at the dairyman's.


---
His room was an immense attic which ran the whole length of the
 dairy- house. 
---
till he arrived

---
Here Clare had plenty of space, and

---
A portion was divided off at one end by
 a curtain, behind which was his bed, the outer part being furnished
 as a homely sitting- room.


---
At first he lived up above entirely,. 
---
which he had bought at a sale
---
that he might have
---
But he soon preferred
---
to read human nature by
 taking his meals downstairs in the general dining- kitchen, with the
 dairyman and his wife, and the maids and men,;, several joined the family at meals. 
---
The longer Clare resided

---
here the less objection had he to his company, and the more did he
 like to share quarters with them in common.


---
Much to his surprise he took, indeed, a real delight in their
 companionship. 
---
The conventional farm- folk of his imagination--
-- were obliterated after a few days' residence. 
---
when Clare's
 intelligence was fresh from a contrasting society
---
whom he now hobnobbed
---
His host and his host's
 household, his men and his maids, intimately known to
 Clare, began.

---
The thought of Pascal's was brought home to him:"_ A mesure qu'on a
 plus d'esprit, on trouve qu'il y a plus d'hommes originaux. 
---
He had been
 disintegrated into a number of varied fellow- creatures-- beings of
 many minds, beings infinite in difference; some happy, many serene, a
 few depressed, one here and there bright even to genius, some stupid,
 others wanton, others austere; some mutely Miltonic, some potentially
 Cromwellian-- into men who had private views of each other, as he had
 of his friends; who could applaud or condemn each other, amuse or
 sadden themselves by the contemplation of each other's foibles or
 vices; men every one of whom walked in his own individual way the
 road to dusty death.


---
Unexpectedly he began,
 and for what it brought, apart from its bearing on his own proposed
 career. 
---
Considering his position he became wonderfully free from the
 chronic melancholy. 
---
For the first time of
 late years he could read.


---
as his musings inclined him, without any eye
 to cramming for a profession, since the few farming handbooks which
 he deemed it desirable to master occupied him but little time
---
He grew away from old associations, and. 
---
Secondarily, he made close acquaintance with phenomena
 which he had before known but darkly-- the seasons in their moods,
 morning and evening, night and noon, winds in their different
 tempers, trees, waters and mists, shades and silences, and the voices
 of inanimate things.



---
that he was too genteel to mess at
 their table
---
by
 Mrs Crick's orders,, it was Angel Clare's custom to sit in the yawning
 chimney- corner during the meal, his cup- and- saucer and plate being
 placed on a hinged flap at his elbow. 
---
at which his companions sat,
---
the moving power being discernible through the
 window in the form of a spiritless horse walking in a circle and
 driven by a boy
---
For several days after Tess's arrival Clare, sitting abstractedly
 reading from some book, periodical, or piece of music just come by
 post,. 
---
that the babble did not
 strike him as possessing a new note, and
---
he was ever in the habit
 of neglecting the particulars of an outward scene for the general
 impression. 
---
when he had been conning one of his
 music- scores, and by force of imagination
---
One day, however, was hearing the tune in
 his head, he lapsed into listlessness, and
---
He looked at the fire of logs, with its one flame
 pirouetting on the top in a dying dance after the breakfast- cooking
 and boiling, and
---
till he thought:"
---
I suppose."


---
Clare looked round upon her,.


---
Indeed, owing to his long silence,
 his presence in the room was almost forgotten.


---
I do n't know about ghosts
---
I do know."


---
The dairyman turned to her with his mouth full
---
, his eyes charged
 with serious inquiry, and
---
his great knife and fork planted erect on the table, like the beginning of
 a gallows.


---
" he said.


---
The dairyman removed his hard gaze from Tess, and.


---
To think o' the miles
 I've vamped o' starlight nights these last thirty year, or for doctor, or for nurse, and yet never had the least
 notion o' that till now, or feeled my soul rise so much as an inch
 above my shirt- collar."


---
Clare continued. 
---
Clare was
---
he
 said to himself.


---
And then he seemed. 
---
which carried him back into a joyous and unforeseeing past
---
He
 concluded. 
---
that he had beheld her before;
---
where he could not tell
---
he was not greatly curious about it. 
---
But the circumstance was
 sufficient to lead him to select Tess in preference to the other
 pretty milkmaids when he wished to contemplate contiguous womankind.




---
since otherwise,
 in the event of a milkman or maid going away from the dairy, he was
 placed in a difficulty
---
," said he. 
---
I HOPE! 
---
I shall
---
But I do n't KNOW."


---
as if his presence
 were somehow a factor in her wish
---
that he might not guess her presence
---
He concluded his
 plaintive melody, a very simple performance, demanding no great
 skill; and
---
But, tired
 of playing, he had desultorily come round the fence, and. 
---
Angel, however, saw her light summer gown, and
---
he spoke; his low
 tones reaching her, though he was some distance off.


---
"?" said he. 
---
" I could n't quite say."


---
" Ah-- so have I, very often. 
---
" All the same, I should n't have expected. 
---
that he meant, and

---
He was surprised to find this young woman-- who though but a milkmaid
 had just that touch of rarity about her which might make her the
 envied of her housemates--. 
---
The perception arrested him less

---
when he reflected
---
which men and
 women have vaguely grasped for centuries
---
Not guessing the cause, there was nothing to remind him that
 experience is as to intensity, and not as to duration. 
---
why a man of clerical family
 and good education, and above physical want, should look upon it as a
 mishap
---
how could this admirable and poetic man ever have

---
that he was at present out of his class
---
he was studying. 
---
he wanted
---
He did not milk cows, but
---
because
 he was obliged
---
because he was learning. 
---
He would become an American or Australian Abraham,
. 
---
that a decidedly
 bookish, musical, thinking young man should have chosen deliberately

---
He observed her dejection one day, when he had casually mentioned
 something to her about pastoral life in ancient Greece. 
---
while he
 spoke
---
" he asked.


---
," he said with
 some enthusiasm,"
---
Why I should be only too glad, my dear Tess,"

"
---
" I meant."


---
" Sometimes I feel
---
I do n't want
---
that I shall only act her part
---
" I should n't mind
---
Of course he spoke with a
 conventional sense of duty only, for that sort of wondering. 
---
as he looked at the
 unpracticed mouth and lips
---
And, he thought. 
---
When he was gone
---
How stupid he must think her! 
---
Mr Clare, as a gentleman and a student of history, would respect
 her sufficiently to forget her childish conduct with the lords and
 ladies
---
if he knew
---
" Mr Clare," said; and if there's one thing that he do hate more than another
' tis the notion of what's called a' old family. 
---
the dairyman emphatically," is one of the most
 rebellest rozums you ever knowed-- not a bit like the rest of his
 family
---
He says. 
---
o' the lands out by
 King's Hintock the Earl o' Wessex, afore even he or
 his
---
Well, Mr Clare found this out, and. 
---
he says to her,'! 
---
A boy came here t'other day, and
---
his name was Matt
---
when we asked him his surname

---
he said, and. '
---
he'd never heard
---
why, he said
---
he supposed
---
his folks had n't been' stablished long
 enough
---
you're the very boy I want!'
---
says Mr Clare,
---
I've great hopes of you;' and. 
---
he ca n't stomach old families!"


---
The insight afforded into Clare's character suggested to her
.




---
that it was largely owing to her supposed untraditional newness that
 she had won interest in his eyes
---
So he allowed.


---
his mind to be

---
By the time Clare was
 downstairs and out in the humid air. 
---
where he was generally awaiting her
---
possibly because he knew; very
 few in all England
---
him think of the
 Resurrection hour
---
He little thought. 
---
that the Magdalen might be
 at his side
---
Whilst all the landscape was in neutral shade his
 companion's face, which was the focus of his eyes,
---
though he did not think of
 it
---
In reality
 her face, without appearing to do so, had caught the cold gleam of
 day from the north- east; his own face,, wore the same aspect to her.


---
He called her Artemis,
 Demeter, and other fanciful names half teasingly, which she did not
 like because she did not understand them.


---
he did.


---
Dairyman Crick and his wife, the milkmaids Tess, Marian, Retty
 Priddle, Izz Huett, and the married ones from the cottages; also
 Mr Clare, Jonathan Kail, old Deborah, and the rest, stood
---
" And he was nothing to what his father
 had been. 
---
if he's alive
---
Even Mr Clare began.


---
I have said fifty times, if I have said once, that I DON'T
 believe in en; though' a do cast folks' waters very true.  But I
 shall have yes, I shall have'" Conjuror Fall, t'other side of Casterbridge, to call
' Wide- O', was a very good man
---
when I was a boy," said Jonathan Kail.

---
He turned to Clare.


---
as he had deceived many afore
---
But he had another sort o'
---
And with that he scrambled into the churn through the trap- door, and

---
where is he
---
me only catch him
---
that he was inside that there churn
---
says he,. 
---
( He was a cowardly
 chap in his heart,). '
---
as such men mostly be
---
he said. 
---
He went forward and
---
( he frequently, with unconscious irony, gave her this
 pet name)," the prettiest milker I've got in my dairy;
---
for you to be in love with him
---
" His thoughts
 be of other cheeks than thine!"


---
" There he is again!"
---
Why-- he was standing over the whey- tub, and
---
the
 shade of his face came upon the wall behind, close to Izz, who was
 standing there filling a vat
---
though he did n't
---
Ah, there he is again! 
---
" We ca n't all marry him
---
" There he is again!"


---
Because he likes Tess Durbeyfield best
---
" Of course
 he wo n't marry any one of us, or Tess either-- a gentleman's son,
 who's going to be a great landowner and farmer abroad! 
---
But
 the unconscious Mr Clare had gone indoors, and
---
they saw him no more;
 and
---
him ascend the ladder to his own room
---
that only the
 slightest ordinary care was necessary for holding her own in Angel

---
there
 was, or a chance of one or the other inspiring him with a
 passing fancy for her, and enjoying the pleasure of his attentions
 while he stayed here. 
---
that Mr Clare had, and corn to reap
---
what would be the use of his marrying a fine lady,
 and
---
whether Mr Clare had spoken
 seriously or not
---
any man to marry her now, and
---
while he remained at Talbothays
---
He had

---
" said the dairyman, who held in his left hand
 a wooden slice on which a lump of butter was stuck.
---
Several of them gathered round him; and
---
Mr Clare tasted.

---
who had thrown himself into abstraction to better

---
and I thought!"

," he resumed;
---
However, they formed themselves into line, all
,; the dairyman at
 the upper end with Mr Clare, who had volunteered to help; then
 Tess, Marian, Izz Huett, and Retty; then Bill Lewell, Jonathan, and
 the married dairywomen-- Beck Knibbs, with her wooly black hair and
 rolling eyes; and flaxen Frances, consumptive from the winter damps
 of the water- meads-- who lived in their respective cottages.


---
who communistically stuck to his rule of taking part
 with the rest in everything
---
Angel Clare,, glanced up now and then. 
---
that he walked next to Tess
---
" he murmured.


---
the hem of her petticoat just touching his gaiter,
 and
---
his elbow sometimes brushing hers
---
he exclaimed,. 
---
Mr Clare also
 stepped out of line, and. 
---
Clare remained observing them-- not without their observing him.


---
that Clare
 remained behind
---
His aspect was probably as un- Sabbatarian a one as a dogmatic
 parson's son often presented; his attire being his dairy clothes,
 long wading boots, a cabbage- leaf inside his hat to keep his head
 cool, with a thistle- spud to finish him off. 
---
He's not going to
 church
---
he was
---
This morning, moreover,
 he had gone out. 
---
On his walk he observed the girls from a long
 distance, though they had been so occupied with their difficulties of
 passage as not to notice him. 
---
He knew. 
---
So he had
 hastened on, with a dim idea of how he could help them-- one of them
 in particular.


---
that he stopped a moment
---
He came beneath them in the water, which did not rise over his long
 boots; and.


---
he said to Marian, who was in
 front,, but.


---
"

" I'll carry you through the pool-- every Jill of you."


---
" I think
---
I'd carry you all four together. 
---
," he continued,"
---
Angel strode off with her, his slim figure,,
.

---
only his sousing
 footsteps and the top ribbon of Marian's bonnet told.

---
In a few minutes he reappeared. 
---
Here he comes
---
" And I have round his neck and look
 into his face as Marian did."


---
Angel Clare,, now approached Izz. 
---
Angel methodically
 marched off with her. 
---
When he was heard
---
He went
 up to the red- haired girl, and
---
while he was seizing her he glanced at
 Tess. 
---
His lips could not have pronounced more plainly,"
---
Poor little Retty, though by far the lightest weight, was the most
 troublesome of Clare's burdens. 
---
However, he got through with the disquieted creature,. 
---
as he had placed them on the next rising ground
---
" Three Leahs to get one Rachel," he whispered.


---
" Not to me," said Angel.


---
He saw; and
---
" I hope?"
---
I am not too heavy
---
him to refer to
---
Clare stood still and.


---
he exclaimed.


---
It reminded Angel; and
---
that he was somewhat

---
he went no
 further with it. 
---
However,
 he walked slowly,; but
---
he set her down.


---
" He likes' ee best-- the very best! 
---
as he brought
' ee
---
He would have kissed' ee,,
 ever so little."


---
if you had encouraged him
---
There was no concealing from herself the fact
 that she loved Angel Clare, perhaps all the more passionately from
 knowing that the others had also lost their hearts to him. 
---
marrying is in
 his mind at all
---
if he were ever
---
he will choose either of you
---
But he did not. 
---
which a practical and
 sordid expectation of winning him as a husband would have destroyed
---
" To confess, then," murmured Izz," I made sure to- day that he was
 going to kiss me as he held me; and I lay still against his breast,
, and.  I do n't
 like biding here at Talbothays any longer!  I shall go hwome."

" B', Tess?" whispered one, half- an- hour later.


---
Some lady looked out for him
---
chosen by his
 family
---
"; a young lady of his own rank,; a Doctor of Divinity's daughter near his father's parish of
 Emminster; he do n't much care for her
---
But he is sure to
 marry her."


---
They
 pictured all the details of his being won round to consent, of the
 wedding preparations, of the bride's happiness, of her dress and
 veil, of her blissful home with him,. 
---
when oblivion would have fallen
 upon themselves as far as he and their love were concerned
---
whom he ignored
---
as Clare was oppressed by the outward
 heats
---
And, so was he burdened inwardly by waxing fervour of passion for
 the soft and silent Tess.


---
as he sped home from market
---
; Dairyman Crick kept his shirt- sleeves
---
then Angel felt inclined to go round the corner also, to finish off a
 hard- yielding milcher who had strayed there
---
, he being now as capable
 of this as the dairyman himself.


---
All the men, and some of the women, when milking, dug their foreheads
 into the cows and. 
---
This was Tess Durbeyfield's
 habit, her temple pressing the milcher's flank, her eyes fixed on
 the far end of the meadow with the quiet of one lost in meditation.

---
that Clare had followed her round
---
that he sat
 under his cow. 
---
he had seen before, and cheeks perhaps as fair
---
he had seen

---
which forced upon his mind with such
 persistent iteration the old Elizabethan simile of roses filled with
 snow
---
Perfect, he, as a lover, might have called them off- hand. 
---
Clare had studied the curves of those lips so many times
---
that he
 could reproduce them mentally with ease: and
---
as they again
 confronted him
---
that had passed into Clare like an excitation from the
 sky
---
He jumped up from his seat,
 and,.


---
He had been on the point of kissing that too tempting mouth, but
---
he
 checked himself, for tender conscience' sake.


---
" Forgive me, Tess dear!" he whispered. 
---
his arm still
 encircling her
---
" he said.


---
" O-- I do n't know!"
---
" Well, I have betrayed my feeling, Tess, at last
---
," said he, with a
 curious sigh of desperation,. 
---
that his heart
 had outrun his judgement
---
" That I-- love you dearly and truly
---
I need

---
-- I am
 as surprised as you are
---
I have presumed upon
 your defencelessness
---
He had allowed; and
---
which changed the pivot of the universe for
 their two natures; something which, had he known its quality, the
 dairyman would have despised, as a practical man; yet which was based
 upon a more stubborn and resistless tendency than a whole heap of
 so- called practicalities
---
The Consequence



 XXV


 Clare, restless, went out into the dusk, she who
 had won him having retired to her chamber.


---
He sat on the east gate of the dairy- yard, and. 
---
while the novelty, unpremeditation, mastery of circumstance
 disquieted him--
---
that he was
---
He
 could hardly realize their true relations to each other as yet, and

---
Angel had come as pupil to this dairy in the idea that his temporary
 existence here was to be the merest episode in his life,
---
soon passed
 through and early forgotten; he had come as to a place from which
 as from a screened alcove he could calmly view the absorbing world
 without, and,. 
---
as it had never, for him, started up
 elsewhere
---
, Clare could hear across the
 yard each trivial sound of the retiring household. 
---
that he had never hitherto deemed it of sufficient importance

---
how great a matter the life of the
 obscure dairy had become to him
---
Many besides
 Angel have learnt, but as to their subjective experiences. 
---
Looking at it thus, he found.


---
Despite his heterodoxy, faults, and weaknesses, Clare was a man with
 a conscience. 
---
upon which he had intruded
---
How then should he
 look upon her as of less consequence than himself
---
which he knew
---
that he had awakened in her-- so
 fervid and so impressionable as she was under her reserve-- in order
 that it might not agonize and wreck her
---
,
 he decided. 
---
He was driven towards her by every heave of his pulse.


---
He thought. 
---
he would go and
---
In less than five months his term here
 would have ended, and
---
after a few additional months spent upon other
 farms he would be fully equipped in agricultural knowledge and in
 a position to start on his own account. 
---
returned to him by the silence
---
Notwithstanding the pleasing answer
, he resolved.


---
" Mr Clare has gone hwome to Emminster
."


---
He's
 getting on towards the end of his time wi' me
---
he
 is beginning
---
so I suppose."

" How much longer is he?
---
He'll bide. 
---
He'll
 hang on till the end of the year I should say.
---
Four months or so of torturing ecstasy in his society-- of" pleasure
 girdled about with pain". 
---
At this moment of the morning Angel Clare was riding along a narrow
 lane ten miles distant from the breakfasters, in the direction of
 his father's Vicarage at Emminster, carrying, as well as he could,
 a little basket which contained some black- puddings and a bottle of
 mead, sent by Mrs Crick, with her kind respects, to his parents. 
---
The
 white lane stretched before him, and
---
his eyes were upon it; but
---
He loved her
---
;
 ought he? 
---
he to marry her
---
his brothers say? 
---
What would he himself say a couple of years
 after the event? 
---
His father's hill- surrounded little town, the Tudor church- tower of
 red stone, the clump of trees near the Vicarage, came at last into
 view beneath him, and
---
he rode down towards the well- known gate.

---
Casting a glance in the direction of the church before entering his
 home, he beheld,.


---
Clare knew her well. 
---
He could not be sure that she observed him
---
; he
 hoped,. 
---
that he should go
 and
---
him decide
---
The young lady was Miss Mercy Chant, the only daughter of his
 father's neighbour and friend, whom it was his parents' quiet hope

---
that he might
---
Clare's
 mind flew to the impassioned, summer- steeped heathens in the Var
 Vale
---
It was on the impulse of the moment that he had resolved to trot
 over to Emminster, and. 
---
He was
 a little late, and
---
as he
 entered
---
They were his father and mother, his brother the Reverend
 Felix---- and his other brother, the Reverend Cuthbert, the
 classical scholar, and Fellow and Dean of his College, down from
 Cambridge for the long vacation. 
---
his father looked. 
---
what in fact he was-- an
 earnest, God- fearing man, somewhat gaunt,
---
in years about sixty- five,
 his pale face lined with thought and purpose
---
Over their heads hung
 the picture of Angel's sister, the eldest of the family, sixteen
 years his senior, who had married a missionary and gone out to
 Africa.


---
Old Mr Clare was a clergyman of a type which, within the last twenty
 years, has well nigh dropped out of contemporary life. 
---
A spiritual
 descendant in the direct line from Wycliff, Huss, Luther, Calvin; an
 Evangelical of the Evangelicals, a Conversionist, a man of Apostolic
 simplicity in life and thought, he had in his raw youth
---
He was regarded even by
 those of his own date and school of thinking as extreme;. 
---
while, on
 the other hand, those totally opposed to him were unwillingly won
 to admiration for his thoroughness, and for the remarkable power he
 showed in dismissing all question as to principles in his energy for
 applying them
---
He loved Paul of Tarsus,. 
---
as he dared
---
The New Testament was less a Christiad then a
 Pauliad to his intelligence-- less an argument than an intoxication.

---
His creed of determinism was such that it almost amounted to a
 vice, and quite amounted, on its negative side, to a renunciative
 philosophy which had cousinship with that of Schopenhauer and
 Leopardi. 
---
He despised the Canons and Rubric, and. 
---
which in a
 way he might have been
---
he certainly was-- sincere.


---
which his son Angel had lately been experiencing in Var
 Vale
---
To the aesthetic, sensuous, pagan pleasure in natural life and lush
 womanhood, his temper would have been antipathetic in a high degree,. 
---
he either by inquiry or imagination been able to apprehend it
---
Once
 upon a time Angel had been so unlucky as to say to his father, in
 a moment of irritation
---
his father's grief was of that
 blank description which could not realize that there might lurk a
 thousandth part of a truth, much less a half truth or a whole truth,
 in such a proposition. 
---
He had simply preached austerely at Angel for
 some time after. 
---
But the kindness of his heart was such that he
 never resented anything for long, and welcomed his son to- day with a
 smile which was as candidly sweet as a child's.


---
Angel sat down, and; yet
---
he did not so much
. 
---
that he returned hither
---
Every
 time he was conscious of this divergence,
 and
---
since he had last shared in the Vicarage life it had grown even
 more distinctly foreign to his own than usual. 
---
Its transcendental
 aspirations-- still unconsciously based on the geocentric view of
 things, a zenithal paradise, a nadiral hell-- were as foreign to his
 own as if they had been the dreams of people on another planet.

---
Latterly he had seen only Life
---
On their part they saw a great difference in him, a growing
 divergence from the Angel Clare of former times. 
---
It was chiefly a
 difference in his manner that they noticed just now, particularly
 his brothers. 
---
He was getting
---
to behave like a farmer; he flung his
 legs about
---
; the muscles of his face had grown more expressive
---
; his
 eyes looked as much information, and more. 
---
as his tongue spoke
---
The
 manner of the scholar had nearly disappeared; still more the manner
 of the drawing- room young man. 
---
that he had
 lost culture, and a prude that he had become coarse
---
After breakfast he walked with his two brothers, non- evangelical,
 well- educated, hall- marked young men, correct to their remotest
 fibre, such unimpeachable models as are turned out yearly by
 the lathe of a systematic tuition. 
---
him to grow dusty on
 their shelves
---
when he was decried in favour
 of Velasquez
---
If these two noticed Angel's growing social ineptness
---
, he noticed
 their growing mental limitations. 
---
Felix seemed to him all Church;
 Cuthbert all College. 
---
His Diocesan Synod and Visitations were the
 mainsprings of the world to the one; Cambridge to the other. 
---
Felix, though an offshoot from a far more
 recent point in the devolution of theology than his father, was. 
---
More tolerant than his father of
 a contradictory opinion, in its aspect as a danger to its holder, he
 was less ready than his father to pardon it as a slight to his own
 teaching. 
---
Cuthbert was, upon the whole,.


---
the more liberal- minded,
 though, with greater subtlety, he had not so much heart
---
As they walked along the hillside Angel's former feeling revived
 in him
---
-- that whatever their advantages by comparison with himself,
 neither saw or. 
---
Perhaps, as
 with many men, their opportunities of observation were not so good
 as their opportunities of expression. 
---
Felix was saying, among other things, to his youngest brother,. 
---
as
 he looked through his spectacles at the distant fields with sad
 austerity
---
But I do
"," said Angel. 
---
if I may trespass upon your domain a little
---
that I am likely to drop my high thinking and my
 moral ideals
---
" Well, I fancied, from the tone of your letters and our
 conversation--. 
---
" Now, Felix," said Angel drily,"; but
---
, I think."


---
They returned down the hill to dinner, which was fixed at any time at
 which their father's and mother's morning work in the parish usually
 concluded. 
---
The walk had made them hungry, Angel in particular, who was now
 an outdoor man, accustomed to the profuse_ dapes inemptae_ of the
 dairyman's somewhat coarsely- laden table. 
---
Angel looked round for Mrs Crick's
 black- puddings, which he had directed to be nicely grilled as they
 did them at the dairy, and
---
of which he wished.


---
his father and mother
 to appreciate the marvellous herbal savours as highly as he did
 himself
---
" But I am sure you will not mind doing without them
 as I am sure your father and I shall not, when you know the reason.

---
I suggested to him; and
---
that we should take Mrs Crick's kind present to
 the children of the man who can earn nothing just now because of his
 attacks of delirium tremens
---
he agreed
---
" Of course," said Angel cheerfully,.


---
" I found the mead so extremely alcoholic,
---
" continued his mother,
" as valuable
 as rum or brandy in an emergency; so I have put it in my
 medicine- closet."


---
," added his
 father.


---
" But what shall I tell the dairyman's wife?"
---
said Angel.


---
" The truth, of course," said his father.


---
" I rather wanted. ",," Mr Clare answered lucidly.


---
" A what?" said Cuthbert and Felix both.


---
He felt.




---
that his parents were right in their practice if
 wrong in their want of sentiment, and
---
that Angel found
 opportunity of broaching to his father one or two subjects near his
 heart
---
He had strung himself up to the purpose,. 
---
Mr Clare and himself were left alone.


---
The young man first discussed with the elder his plans for the
 attainment of his position as a farmer on an extensive scale-- either
 in England or in the Colonies. 
---
His father then told him.


---
as he
 had not been put to the expense of sending Angel up to Cambridge
---
that,, he
 had felt it his duty to set by a sum of money every year towards the
 purchase or lease of land for him some day,
---
that he might not feel

---
himself unduly slighted
---
" As far," continued his father,
---
This considerateness on old Mr Clare's part led Angel onward to the
 other and dearer subject. 
---
He observed to his father
---
that he was
 then six- and- twenty, and
---
when he should start in the farming
 business
---
that he would require eyes in the back of his head
---
, therefore, for him to marry?


---
His father seemed; and
---
then Angel
 put the question--

"?"


---
Clare, the elder, had plainly never thought of these points before.

---
" I was going
---
," he said,". 
---
But her father, quite as opposed to
 such flummery as I, says. 
---
which, I am sure,
---
I know. 
---
His father persisted in his conviction; and
---
the
 impulsive Angel, wishing to honour his father's feelings and to
 advance the cause of his heart at the same time,.

---
He said. 
---
that fate or Providence had thrown in his way a woman who
 possessed every qualification to be the helpmate of an agriculturist,
 and was decidedly of a serious turn of mind
---
He would not say
; but
---
," said Angel,
 unflinchingly,". 
---
as I am proud to

---
" said Angel quickly.

---
as I
 have
---
while as to her reading, I can take that
 in hand
---
if I may use the
 expression
---
, I am sure
---
" Mother, I beg pardon. 
---
But is a good Christian girl, I am sure you
 will tolerate any social shortcomings for the sake of that quality,
 and feel that I may do worse than choose her." 
---
Angel waxed quite
 earnest on that rather automatic orthodoxy in his beloved Tess
---
that it might stand him in such good stead
---
which
( never dreaming) he had
 been prone to slight, because of its obvious unreality amid beliefs essentially
 naturalistic.


---
he claimed for the unknown young woman, Mr and
 Mrs Clare
---
Angel therefore refrained from declaring more particulars now.

---
He felt.

---
single- minded and self- sacrificing as his parents
 were
---
as he chose
---
, in the probability of her living far away from them,
 he wished for affection's sake.


---
He observed his own inconsistencies in dwelling upon accidents in
 Tess's life. 
---
It was for herself her soul, her heart, her substance-- not for her skill
 in the dairy, her aptness as his scholar, and certainly not for
 her simple formal faith- professions. 
---
that
 he loved Tess;
---
He held that education had as yet but little affected the
 beats of emotion and impulse on which domestic happiness depends. 
---
as he could see
---
confirmed by his experience of women, which, having latterly been
 extended from the cultivated middle- class into the rural community
---
,
 had taught him how much less was the intrinsic difference between the
 good and wise woman of one social stratum and the good and wise woman
 of another social stratum, than between the good and bad, the wise
 and the foolish, of the same stratum or class.


---
It was the morning of his departure. 
---
His brothers had already left
 the Vicarage. 
---
whence one
 was, and the other to his curacy
---
Angel
 might have accompanied them, but. 
---
He would have been an awkward member of the
 party;
---
for, though the most appreciative humanist, the most ideal
 religionist, even the best- versed Christologist of the three, there
 was alienation in the standing consciousness that his squareness
 would not fit the round hole that had been prepared for him. 
---
neither Felix nor Cuthbert had he ventured.


---
his father accompanied him,
 on his own mare, a little way along the road. 
---
Having fairly well
 advanced his own affairs, Angel listened in a willing silence,, because of his strict interpretations of
 the New Testament by the light of what they deemed a pernicious
 Calvinistic doctrine.


---
as
 they jogged on together through the shady lanes, to his father's
 account of his parish difficulties, and the coldness of brother
 clergymen whom he loved
---
" Pernicious!" said Mr Clare, with genial scorn; and
---
he proceeded to
 recount experiences which would show the absurdity of that idea.

---
He told of wondrous conversions of evil livers of which he had been
 the instrument, not only amongst the poor, but amongst the rich and
 well- to- do; and
---
he also candidly admitted many failures.


---
As an instance of the latter, he mentioned the case of a young
 upstart squire named d'Urberville,.


---
disappeared sixty
 or eighty years ago-- at least, I believe so. 
---
I hope
---
to be a
 new family; for the credit of the former
 knightly line, I'm sure. 
---
I thought"

"
---
;," said Angel with a
 little impatience. 
---
" Politically I am sceptical as to the virtue of
. 
---
lyrically,
 dramatically, and even historically, I am tenderly attached to them."


---
This distinction, though by no means a subtle one, was yet too
 subtle for Mr Clare the elder, and
---
he went on with the story he had
;. 
---
that after the death of the senior
 so- called d'Urberville, the young man developed the most culpable
 passions,
---
though he had a blind mother, whose condition should have
 made him know better
---
A knowledge of his career having come to
 the ears of Mr Clare,
---
when he was in that part of the country
 preaching missionary sermons
---
, he boldly took occasion. 
---
Though he was a stranger,

---
occupying another's pulpit, he had felt this, and
!" 
---
The young man much resented this
 directness of attack, and
---
in the war of words he did not scruple publicly without
 respect for his gray hairs.


---
Angel flushed with distress.


---
," he said sadly,"
---
" Dear father I wish!"


---
" Pain?" said his father, his rugged face shining in the ardour of
 self- abnegation. 
---
" The only pain to me was pain on his account, poor,
 foolish young man. 
---
his incensed words could give
 me any pain, or even his blows
---
He did not proceed to blows?
---
" No, he did not. 
---
Though I have borne blows from men in a mad state
 of intoxication."

 I have saved them from the guilt
 of murdering their own flesh and blood thereby; and" May this young man do the same!"
---
said Angel fervently. 
---
" But I fear
 otherwise, from what you say."


---
"," said Mr Clare. 
---
" And I continue, though on this side of the grave we shall probably never
 meet again. 
---
Now, as always, Clare's father was sanguine as a child; and
---
though
 the younger could not accept his parent's narrow dogma
---
, he revered
 his practice and. 
---
Perhaps he
 revered his father's practice even more now than ever,.

---
Angel's getting
 a living as a farmer would probably keep his brothers in the
 position of poor parsons for the term of their activities; yet Angel
 admired it none the less. 
---
Indeed, despite his own heterodoxy, Angel
 often felt.




---
that he was nearer to his father on the human side
---
mid- day atmosphere brought him in the afternoon to a detached knoll
 a mile or two west of Talbothays
---
, whence he again looked into that
 green trough of sappiness and humidity, the valley of the Var or
 Froom. 
---
Immediately he began
---
Clare was now so familiar with
 the spot that he knew the individual cows by their names when, a long
 distance off, he saw them dotted about the meads. 
---
It was with a
 sense of luxury, he could not
 help being aware that to come here, as now, after an experience of
 home- life, affected him like throwing off splints and bandages.


---
that he recognized his power of viewing life here
 from its inner side, in a way that had been quite foreign to him in
 his student- days; and,
---
much as he loved his parents
---
At the door the wood- hooped pails, sodden and, hung like hats on a stand upon the forked and peeled limb
 of an oak fixed there for that purpose
---
Angel entered, and. 
---
where he listened for a
 moment
---
Sustained snores came from the cart- house, where some of
 the men were lying down
---
He unbridled and, and
---
as he re
---
with
 the stroke, Clare heard the creaking of the floor- boards above, and
 then the touch of a descending foot on the stairs
---
It was Tess's,
 who in another moment came down before his eyes.


---
him enter
---
he saw the red interior of her mouth. 
---
that he could see its satin delicacy above
 the sunburn
---
-- I--"

 There had not at first been time for her to think of the changed
 relations which his declaration had introduced; but
---
he whispered,. 
---
I have hastened back so soon because of you!"


---
Tess's excitable heart beat against his by way of reply; and
---
the sun slanting in
 by the window upon his back,;
 upon her inclining face, upon the blue veins of her temple, upon her
 naked arm, and her neck, and into the depths of her hair
---
as he held her tightly to his breast
---
his plumbed the deepness of the ever- varying pupils, with
 their radiating fibrils of blue, and black, and gray, and violet,
 might have
.


---
" I've got
---
I have on'y old Deb to
. 
---
I have come back, Deborah
---
"," said Mr Clare, upwards. 
---
" So I can help

---
Every time to cool it for the
 work the ardour of his affection being so palpable
 that she seemed to flinch under it like a plant in too burning a sun.


---
Then he pressed her again to his side, and when she had done running
 her forefinger round the leads to cut off the cream- edge.


---
, he cleaned
 it in nature's way;
---
" I may as well say it now as later, dearest
---
," he resumed gently. 
---
" I
 wish. 
---
which I have

---
I shall
 soon want, and,
---
I shall require for
 my wife a woman who knows all about the management of farms
---
He put it that way that she might not think he had yielded to an
 impulse of which his head would disapprove.


---
O Mr Clare-- I can not be your wife
---
"-- I can not be!"


---
he said, amazed at her reply, and holding her still more
 greedily close. 
---
And I would rather be yours than anybody's in the
 world
---
" But I CANNOT marry you!"


---
," he said,,
---
" I do n't want! 
---
I have not thought of doing it. 
---
I can not!

---
I only want."


---
" Your father is a parson, and your mother wouldn' like you to marry
 such as me. 
---
" Nonsense-- I have spoken to them both. 
---
why I went
 home
---
" I feel--
---
I cannot
---
" Yes-- I did not expect it."


---
", Tessy, I will give you time
---
," he
 said. 
---
I'll not allude to it again for a while."


---
I ca n't skim
---
"-- I ca n't!
---
Not to agitate and hinder her longer, the considerate Clare began
. 
---
He
 himself knew. 
---
Confused or otherwise,
 to disturb them was his last desire:


       Leave thou thy sister, when she prays,
          Her early Heaven, her happy views;
          Nor thou with shadow'd hint confuse
      
---
He had occasionally thought the counsel less honest than musical; but

---
he gladly conformed to it now.


---
He spoke further of the incidents of his visit, of his father's mode
 of life, of his zeal for his principles
---
he followed her, and
---
" Yes-- well, my father had been talking a good deal to me of his
 troubles and difficulties, and
---
He is so zealous that he gets many snubs and buffetings from
 people of a different way of thinking from himself, and I do n't
 like to hear of such humiliations to a man of his age, the more
 particularly as I do n't think earnestness does any good when carried
 so far. 
---
He has been telling me of a very unpleasant scene in
 which he took part quite recently. 
---
He went as the deputy of some
 missionary society, and.

---
it his business to expostulate
 with a lax young cynic he met with somewhere about there-- son of some
 landowner up that way-- and
---
My father addressed himself to the gentleman point- blank, and
---
It was very foolish of my father. 
---
But whatever
 he thinks. 
---
that he'll do, in season or out of season;
 and,
---
of course, he makes many enemies, not only among the absolutely
 vicious, but among the easy- going, who hate being bothered
---
He says
."


---
he glories in what happened, and
---
he would not wear himself out now
---
he is getting old, and

---
Clare's revived thoughts of
 his father prevented his noticing her particularly; and
---
he said to her softly--

"
---
It seemed natural enough to him
 now that Tess was again in sight to choose a mate from unconstrained
 Nature, and not from the abodes of Art.




---
Her refusal, though unexpected, did not permanently daunt Clare.

---
His experience of women was great enough for him to be aware that
 the negative often meant nothing more than the preface to the
 affirmative; and
---
for him not to know
---
he read as an additional assurance,
---
he asked her in
 the course of a few days.


---
I told you why-- partly. 
---
I am not good enough-- not
 worthy enough.
---
I do n't care--" 
---
He clasped his fingers behind her back. 
---
I am sure you
 did not! 
---
that I can not read, or
---
I am in no hurry, Tess, but
---
I want--?"


---
Clare regarded her attentively,. 
---
" Then I ought not--
---
to hold you in this way ought I? 
---
I have no
 right to you--
---
Honestly, Tess, do you love any other man?"


---
" But you will not accept me as a husband?"


---
At such times as this, apprehending the grounds of her refusal to be
 her modest sense of incompetence in matters social and polite, he
 would say. 
---
which
 was certainly true, her natural quickness and her admiration for him

---
; her own heart was so strongly on the
 side of his-- two ardent hearts against one poor little conscience--
.

---
to know; nobody told him.


---
Mr Crick, as well as his wife, seemed latterly to have acquired a
 suspicion of mutual interest between these two;.
---
Durbeyfield's hands showed themselves of the pinkness of the rose.

---
who was filling the vats with his handful
---
Angel,, suddenly ceased,
 and. 
---
bending lower he kissed the inside vein of her soft
 arm.


---
Truth is truth between man and woman, as between man and
 man
---
they beamed devotedly into his,.


---
why I did that, Tess" he said.


---
he went on
---
"," I CANNOT think.

---
And yet,
 dearest," he quickly added,
---
," I
 know.

---
So how can I suppose you a flirt? 
---
Clare was so pained and.


---
that he
 ran after and
---
he said,!"


---
I will
---
", I will tell you!"
---
" And I will give you a
 complete answer,.
---
I will tell you my
 experiences-- all about myself-- all!"


---
He expressed
 assent in loving satire, looking into her face. 
---
" I will try-- not! 
---
And I'll give you my reasons to- morrow-- next
 week.
---
Reckless, inconsiderate acceptance of him; to close with him at the
 altar, revealing nothing, and chancing discovery; to snatch ripe
 pleasure before the iron teeth of pain could have time to shut upon
 her
---
Angel looked thoughtfully
 at her from a distance, but. 
---
I shall give way
---
"-- I shall say yes--
---
I shall let--
---
myself marry
 him
---
I can not help it!"
---
" I ca n't bear!

---
anybody have him but me
---
Yet it is a wrong to him, and! 
---
when he knows
---
I've heard news o' this morning
---
" said
 Dairyman Crick, as he sat down to breakfast next day, with a riddling
 gaze round upon the munching men and maids."
---
He's lately got married to a widow- woman."


---
The name entered quickly into Tess Durbeyfield's consciousness, for

---
it was the name of the lover who had wronged his sweetheart, and.


---
" And had he married the valiant matron's daughter,?"

---
as he promised
---
as he turned over the newspaper
---
he was

---
to which he was always banished by Mrs
 Crick, in her sense of his gentility
---
that was all he was after. 
---
that the ghost of
 her first man would trouble him
---
He glanced towards the row of girls.


---
when he
 could hardly have backed out
---
what he was after
---
if he'd said two words to me
 about not telling him beforehand anything whatsomdever about my first
 chap that I had n't chose to tell
---
, I'd ha' knocked him down wi' the
 rolling- pin-- a scram little feller like he! 
---
Men had been cutting the water- weeds higher up
 the river, and
---
Clare sprang across the gully,
 alighting beside her feet. 
---
" No, no; I can not. 
---
For your sake, O Mr Clare; for your sake, I say
 no!"


---
" Still I say no!
---
Not expecting this, he had put his arm the
 moment after speaking, beneath her hanging tail of hair. 
---
Yes" instead of" No" he
 would have kissed her
---
; it had evidently been his intention; but

---
her determined negative deterred his scrupulous heart. 
---
that he felt it unfair to
 her to exercise any pressure of blandishment which he might have
 honestly employed
---
He released
 her momentarily- imprisoned waist, and.


---
to refuse
 him this time was solely the tale of the widow told by the dairyman;
 and
---
But Angel said
 no more
---
his face was perplexed
---
;; he went away.


---
that he might ask her again
---
His plan of procedure was different now--. 
---
as though he had made up
 his mind that her negatives were, after all, only coyness and youth
 startled by the novelty of the proposal
---
So he played a more coaxing game; and
---
while never going beyond
 words, or attempting the renewal of caresses, he did his utmost
 orally.


---
In this way Clare persistently wooed her in undertones like that of
 the purling milk-- at the cow's side, at skimmings, at butter- makings,
 at cheese- makings, among broody poultry, and among farrowing pigs-- as
 no milkmaid was ever wooed before by such a man.


---
he was so godlike in her eyes; and being, though
 untrained, instinctively refined, her nature cried for his tutelary
 guidance. 
---
And thus, repeating to herself," I can
 never be his wife
---
Every sound of his voice beginning on the old
 subject stirred her with a terrifying bliss, and
---
His manner was--?-- so much that of one who would
 love and cherish and defend her under any conditions, changes,
 charges, or revelations, that her gloom lessened as she basked in it.

---
a fresh renewal
 of Clare's pleading occurred one morning between three and four.


---
At the same moment he came down his steps from above in his
 shirt- sleeves and.


---
" Now, Miss Flirt,," he said peremptorily.
---
since I spoke
---
I shall have. 
---
I saw you. 
---
For your own safety I must go. 
---
I am only just up, Mr Clare, and
---
I will
 really think seriously about it between now and then. 
---
that I agree,
---
if I MUST
---
Clare had resolved; but. 
---
until he had obtained her
 promise
---
,
 he broke his resolve, and
---
as he regarded the three figures tripping
 before him through the frigid pallor of opening day
---
, I think
---
Dairyman Crick,, his wrapper gleaming
 miraculously white against a leaden evening sky, suddenly looked
 at his heavy watch.


---
" Why,' tis later than I thought," he said. 
---
Mr Clare volunteered,,
. 
---
though it was none of his business
---
Clare gently urged her. 
---
Every now and then Angel would
 fling the lash of his whip round one of these
---
," said he. 
---
" But how glad I am!"


---
" I am so afraid you will get cold, with nothing upon your arms and
 shoulders
---
," he said. 
---
I should be sorrier still."


---
if I did not think

---
he wrapped round them both a
 large piece of sail- cloth, which was sometimes used to keep the sun
 off the milk- cans. 
---
Clare's hands being occupied.


---
that he could hear for a little while
---
He said no more then. 
---
," he observed,
---
I never pass one of their residences without thinking of them. 
---
The light of the engine flashed for a second upon Tess
 Durbeyfield's figure,. 
---
; father was not very
 industrious, and
---
he drank a little."


---
He pressed her more closely
 to his side.


---
I
 was--"

 Tess's breath quickened.

" I-- I-- am not a Durbeyfield, but a d'Urberville-- a descendant of the
 same family as those that owned the old house we passed.  And is that all the trouble, dear Tess?"


---
He laughed.


---
that many of the hills and fields once belonged to
 my father's people
---
Tess( he laughed), and. 
---
as he spoke
---
By the bye, there's
 one of that kidney who has taken the name-- where have I heard of
 him?--
---
Why, he is the
 very man who had that rumpus with my father I told you of. 
---
He clasped her close and.


---
he was surprised.


---
as he would
---
by the end of the week a response to her communication
 arrived in Joan Durbeyfield's wandering last- century hand.


   
---
that on no account do you say a word of your
    Bygone Trouble to him
---
J did not tell everything
    to your Father,
---
he being so Proud on account of his
    Respectability, which, perhaps, your Intended is
    the same. 
---
J have not named
    either that Question or your coming marriage to your
    Father, as he would blab it everywhere, poor Simple
    Man.

   
---
There was hardly a touch of earth in her love for Clare. 
---
he was all
---
The wisdom
 of her love for him, as love, sustained her dignity
---
The compassion of his love for her,,
 made her lift up her heart to him in devotion. 
---
He would sometimes
 catch her large, worshipful eyes, that had no bottom to them looking
 at him from their depths, as if she saw something immortal before
 her.


---
that men could be so disinterested, chivalrous,
 protective, in their love for women as he
---
Angel Clare was far from
 all that she thought him in this respect
---
but he was, in truth, more spiritual than animal
---
; absurdly far, indeed;
; he had himself
 well in hand, and. 
---
Though not
 cold- natured, he was rather bright than hot-- less Byronic than
 Shelleyan
---
which could jealously guard the loved one against his very self
---
which attracts men in general
---
though it seemed oddly anticipative to Clare
---
till he
 saw
---
The sun was so near the
 ground, and the sward so flat, that the shadows of Clare and Tess
 would stretch a quarter of a mile ahead of them, like two long
 fingers pointing afar to where the green alluvial reaches abutted
 against the sloping sides of the vale.


---
Men were at work here and there--.

---
Clare hardily kept his arm round her waist in sight of these
 watermen, with the air of a man who was accustomed to public
 dalliance, though actually as shy as she who, with lips parted and
 eyes askance on the labourers,.


---
where it
 rested like crystals, and on his brows and hair
---
Her affection for him was now the breath and life of Tess's being
---
how strange that he should have cited them now.


---
Angel began.


---
how careful he would
 have
---
he said. 
---
just what I feel
---
If I
 had only known! 
---
" I should have had four years more of your heart. 
---
than I can ever have
 now
---
Then I should not have wasted my time
---
as I have done
---
-- I should
 have had so much longer happiness!"


---
He sat on by the cheerful firelight thrown from a bundle of green
 ash- sticks laid across the dogs
---
he said, good- humouredly,. 
---
as he spread a cushion for her on the
 stool, and
---
" I wanted to
."


---
" Yes, perhaps I am capricious
---
I am not really so-- by nature," 
---
I mean!
---
The more particularly to
 assure him
---
her head to find a resting- place against Clare's
 shoulder
---
to ask me-- I am sure I will answer it,"

---
" I like."


---
" But I must think of starting in business on my own hook with the
 new year, or a little later. 
---
before I get involved in the
 multifarious details of my new position
---
And, I should like.
---
" But--"

 He drew her gently nearer to him.


---
" I said to myself,!
 But I was n't really sitting on his knee, though it might ha' seemed
!"


---
He continued to his wife, with the stolid
 mien of a man who understood nothing of the emotions relating to
 matrimony--"Now, Christianer,. 
---
O no, I
 should never ha' thought a word of, to be married soon," said Clare, with improvised
 phlegm.


---
Well, I am truly glad to hear it, sir. 
---
I've
 thought you mid. 
---
She's too good for a
 dairymaid-- I said so the very first day I zid her-- and a prize for
 any man; and what's more, a wonderful woman for a gentleman- farmer's
 wife; he wo n't be at the mercy of his baily wi' her at his side."


---
" He's going!"
---
" He ought,
---
" He ought!"
---
You would be better for him than--
---
especially since he had taught' ee so much
---
when you be his wife, Tess, and of how we told
' ee that we loved him, and how we tried not to hate you, and did not
 hate you, and could not hate you, because you were his choice, and
 we never hoped to be chose by him
---
him for whom she lived and
---
if he would
---
which might be deemed a treachery to him,
---
though he
 asked her at the most tempting times
---
In the presence of these things
 he would remind her.


---
Or he would ask her at night,. 
---
when he accompanied her on some mission
 invented by Mrs Crick
---
Clare was not particularly heeding.


---
" Did Crick speak to you to- day, dear, about his not wanting much
 assistance during the winter months?"


---
that he would no longer require you
---
But,
 knowing, he said in the most good- natured
 and respectful manner possible
---
that he supposed on my leaving at
 Christmas
---
I should take you with me, and
---
what he would
 do without you
---
on my asking he merely observed. 
---
that, as a matter of fact, it was a
 time of year when he could do with a very little female help
---
I am
 afraid I was sinner enough to feel rather glad that he was in this
 way forcing your hand."


---
" I do n't think. 
---
He put his finger
 upon her cheek. 
---
" Ah!" he said.


---
" I feel! 
---
Perhaps I saw that."


---
to go to some arable farm
 where no divine being like Angel Clare was. 
---
" So that, seriously, dearest Tess," he continued,"
---
" I wish. 
---
" I always shall."


---
" O, I know!
---
" Angel, I will fix the day when I will become yours for
 always!"


---
What should he do about his skimming? 
---
who was no
 common outdoor man
---
which might be accepted with
 a light heart by a rougher man
---
A post- nuptial explanation,, might not be received with the same
 feeling by him. 
---
But this communication brought no reply from Mrs
 Durbeyfield.


---
Despite Angel Clare's plausible representation to himself and to Tess
 of the practical need for their immediate marriage, there was in
 truth an element of precipitancy in the step,. 
---
He loved her dearly, though perhaps rather ideally and
 fancifully than with the impassioned thoroughness of her feeling for
 him. 
---
He had entertained no notion,,. 
---
as he had thought to
 an unintellectual bucolic life
---
as he beheld in this
 idyllic creature
---
he had not known. 
---
until he came here
---
Yet he was very far from seeing his future track
 clearly, and
---
before he would be able to
 consider himself fairly started in life
---
The secret lay in the tinge
 of recklessness imparted to his career and character by the sense
.


---
that he had been made
---
He wished.

---
His parents had naturally desired; and

---
once at least before he
 carried her off to a distant settlement, English or colonial
---
to see her to be allowed to change his intention,
 he judged
---
that a couple of months' life with him in lodgings
 whilst seeking for an advantageous opening would be of some social
 assistance to her at what she might feel to be a trying ordeal-- her
 presentation to his mother at the Vicarage.


---
Next, he wished. 
---
that he might combine the use of one with
 corn- growing
---
The proprietor of a large old water- mill at
 Wellbridge-- once the mill of an Abbey-- had offered him the inspection
 of his time- honoured mode of procedure, and a hand in the operations
 for a few days, whenever he should choose to come. 
---
Clare paid a
 visit to the place, some few miles distant, one day at this time,
.

---
And what had determined him? 
---
how Clare settled practical questions
---
," he said,"
---
by March or April we will
 pay a visit to my father and mother."


---
Questions of procedure such as these arose and, and the day,
 the incredible day, on which she was to become his, loomed large in
 the near future. 
---
Perhaps he had forgotten! 
---
Mrs Crick assumed a matron's privilege
 of speaking to Angel on the point.


---
," says Clare.


---
as he caught Tess alone
---
As soon he assured her:

". 
---
whether he would like her

---
The question was set at rest by his forethought,
.

---
He entered the house shortly after
 the arrival of the packages, and.


---
And to divert her from thinking too highly of him, he told her, and.


---
XXXIII


 Angel felt; a romantic day,
 in circumstances that would never be repeated; with that other and
 greater day beaming close ahead of them. 
---
that he would like
---
During the preceding week,
 therefore, he suggested and
---
Clare's life at the dairy had been that of a recluse in respect the
 world of his own class. 
---
For months he had never gone near a town,
 and,
---
if he rode or
---
while Angel went
---
Two men came out and. 
---
he was a Trantridge man
---
And he
 negatived the remainder of the definition forthwith.


---
Clare had just returned from the stable- yard, and,. 
---
The insult to her stung him to the quick, and
---
before he had

---
he struck the man on the chin with the
 full force of his fist,
---
The man recovered himself, and and
---
Clare,
 stepping outside the door, put himself in a posture of defence. 
---
But
 his opponent began. 
---
He looked anew at
 Tess, and. 
---
as he passed her
---
that he had been too hasty
---
that he was,
 moreover,
---
what he usually did in such cases
---
as Clare had taken the reins from the ostler
---
, the two men went in the other
 direction.


---
" he asked good- humouredly.


---
" No-- I only meant--."


---
he directed her. 
---
Clare ascended to
 his attic. 
---
in her
 anxiety lest Clare should be ill she ran up and knocked at his door,
 and.


---
," he said from within. 
---
" I am so sorry
---
I disturbed
 you! 
---
: I fell asleep and

---
that I was fighting that fellow again who insulted you,
 and the noise you heard was my pummelling away with my fists at
 my portmanteau, which I pulled out to- day for packing. 
---
I am
 occasionally liable to these freaks in my sleep.
---
; he descended, as
 usual. 
---
He met her at the bottom of the stairs and

---
He looked a little disturbed and worn
---
But he said not
 a word to her about her revelation,. 
---
Could
 he have had it? 
---
Unless he began the subject
---
that whatever
 he thought
---
he meant
---
Yet he was frank and
 affectionate as before. 
---
that he forgave her
---
; that he loved her for what she was,? 
---
Had he
 really received her note? 
---
that he forgave her
---
even if he had

---
Every morning and night he was the same, and
---
I was o't"
---
As for Angel's family, he had
. 
---
that he
 would be glad to see one at least of them there for the day
---
if he
 would like
---
His brothers had not replied at all,;
---
while his father and mother had written
 a rather sad letter, deploring his precipitancy in rushing into
 marriage, but
---
seeming
 to be indignant with him making the best of the matter by saying,
 their son had arrived at an age which he might be supposed to be the
 best judge.


---
This coolness in his relations distressed Clare less than it would
 have done
---
had he been without the grand card with which he meant to
. 
---
To produce Tess, fresh from the dairy, as
 a d'Urberville and a lady, he had felt
---
to be temerarious and risky;
 hence he had concealed her lineage till such time as,
---
familiarized
 with worldly ways by a few months' travel and reading with him, he
 could take her on a visit to his parents and.

---
Perhaps Tess's lineage
 had more value for himself than for anybody in the world beside.


---
that Angel's bearing towards her still remained in no
 whit altered by her own communication
---
if he could have received it
---
before he had

---
which had been Clare's den
---
him read it now
---
when he saw her again
---
that he felt quite anxious
---
The only minute to be alone with Clare was.


---
he cried. 
---
Those words of his seemed.

---
The postilion was a venerable" boy" of
 sixty-- a martyr to rheumatic gout, the result of excessive exposure
 in youth, counter- acted by strong liquors-- who had stood at inn- doors
 doing nothing for the whole five- and- twenty years that had elapsed
 since he had no longer been required to ride professionally, as if
 expecting the old times to come back again. 
---
He had a permanent
 running wound on the outside of his right leg,.


---
originated by the
 constant bruisings of aristocratic carriage- poles during the many
 years that he had been in regular employ at the King's Arms,
 Casterbridge
---
Angel would have liked one at least
 of his brothers, but
---
their silence after
 his gentle hint to that effect by letter had signified. 
---
that Angel was close to her
---
so that her shoulder
 touched his arm
---
that he was really
 there, and
---
that his fidelity would be proof
 against all things
---
Clare knew
---
he did not know at that time the full depth of her devotion, its
 single- mindedness, its meekness
---
" oppressed," said Clare.


---
A certain
 d'Urberville of the sixteenth or seventeenth century committed a
 dreadful crime in his family coach; and
---
He silenced her by a kiss.


---
it was her
 husband who really had her supplication. 
---
Her idolatry of this man
 was such that she herself almost feared it to be ill- omened. 
---
at which he meant
---
standing in the red- brick entry to see, the dairyman and
 his wife following to the door. 
---
Clare had not the least objection to such a farewell formality-- which
 was all that it was to him-- and as he passed them he kissed them in
 succession where they stood, saying" Goodbye" to each as he did so.

---
he
 shook hands with the dairyman and his wife, and. 
---
his notes thrilled their ears through,.


---
Two men were standing by the yard gate,.


---
" I do n't like!"" said the
 dairyman with some irritation, turning to the bird and driving him
 away. 
---
I've not heard his crow of an afternoon all the year
 afore." It only means a change in the weather
---
" Welcome to one of your ancestral mansions!" said Clare. 
---
as he handed
 her down
---
But he regretted the pleasantry
---
But he found. 
---
that the mouldy old habitation somewhat depressed his
 bride
---
" said he.


---
He looked up, and. 
---
The long pointed features, narrow eye, and smirk of the one, so
 suggestive of merciless treachery; the bill- hook nose, large
 teeth, and bold eye of the other suggesting arrogance to the point
 of ferocity, haunt the beholder afterwards in his dreams.


---
He said nothing of this, however, and,

---
that he had gone out of his way
---
Clare touched hers under the water.


---
he said,.

---
He had not been displeased with her
 thoughtfulness on such an occasion
---
that he found it interesting to use the
 same bread- and- butter plate as herself, and
---
He wondered a little that she did not enter into
 these frivolities with his own zest.


---
he thought to himself, as one deciding on the true construction of
 a difficult passage. 
---
to change," said Clare.


---
" I wonder. 
---
I do n't know
---
He knew, and
---
said he, sorry. 
---
", I know. 
---
I can not think. 
---
Ah, there he is!"


---
, Clare went out. 
---
He returned to the room with a small package in
 his hand.


---
," he said.


---
Clare
 brought it to the light. 
---
"," said he,. 
---
" I think
---
I would rather have
---
He undid the parcel. 
---
The note was for Clare, in the following words:


   
---
," said Clare;
---
I had quite forgotten."


---
"," said he.


---
He looked into the fire. 
---
He remembered. 
---
when he was a lad of
 fifteen, his godmother, the Squire's wife-- the only rich person
 with whom he had ever come in contact--
---
There had seemed
 nothing at all out of keeping with such a conjectured career in the
 storing up of these showy ornaments for his wife and the wives of
 her descendants. 
---
" Yet why?"
 he asked himself. 
---
Suddenly he said with enthusiasm--

" Tess,!" 
---
And he turned from the fire to
.


---
," said Clare. 
---
" Yes," said he.


---
He suggested to her; and

---
to do, he
 stepped back.


---
" My heavens," said Clare,"!"


---
He had never till now estimated the artistic
 excellence of Tess's limbs and features.


---
" to appear in a ball- room!" he said. 
---
no, dearest; I think."


---
I love you best in the wing- bonnet and
 cotton- frock-- yes, better than in this, well as you support these
 dignities
---
" I'll take them off.

---
they had
 poured out for his consumption
---
when he came
---
as if
 some giant had laid his hand on the chimney- top for a moment
---
Angel went out.


---
for it was he at last
---
lines of concern were ploughed upon his
 forehead in addition to the lines of years. 
---
In the water he
 found her. 
---
He and another man brought her home,; but
---
Angel, suddenly recollecting, went; but
---
till he had done
---
him express his thanks for the ale her husband took out to him,
 and for the gratuity he received
---
his cart creaked away.


---
Angel slid forward the massive oak bar which secured the door, and
. 
---
He expected, but
---
he sat down with her in the firelight,.


---
,"
 he said. 
---
This final determination, he holding her hand.


---
he asked abruptly,. 
---
I want."


---
This, from him, so unexpectedly apposite, had the effect upon her of
 a Providential interposition.


---
He seemed. 
---
Clare went
---
My brother's Fellowship was won at his college, mine at
 Talbothays Dairy. 
---
my poor father fears
---
He then told her of that time of his life to which allusion has been
 made when, tossed about by doubts and difficulties in London, like a
 cork on the waves
---
, he plunged into eight- and- forty hours' dissipation
 with a stranger.


---
," he
 continued. 
---
which fell on
 his face and hand, and on hers,
---
Clare performed the irrelevant act of stirring the fire
---
; the
 intelligence had not even yet got to the bottom of him. 
---
he rose to his feet
---
His face had withered. 
---
In the
 strenuousness of his concentration he treadled fitfully on the floor.

---
He could not, by any contrivance, think closely enough
---
; that was the
 meaning of his vague movement. 
---
When he spoke.


---
it was in the most
 inadequate, commonplace voice of the many varied tones she had heard
 from him
---
He looked vacantly at her,:

---
These and other of his words were nothing but the perfunctory babble
 of the surface. 
---
He turned away,
 and. 
---
where he was, and
---
as he did not answer
---
He paused,;
---
He did not answer; and
---
He shook his head.


---
He looked upon her as a species of
 imposter; a guilty woman in the guise of an innocent one. 
---
The horrible
 sense of his view of her so deadened her and
---
he
 stepped forward,.


---
" Sit down, sit down," he said gently. 
---
I do n't belong to you any more, then
---
"; do I, Angel?
---
" It is not me, but another woman like me that he loved,

---
he says.
---
Clare was relieved at this change, for the effect on her of what had
 happened. 
---
He waited patiently, apathetically,

---
" Angel, am I too wicked for
?"


---
that he was smothering his
 affection for her
---
that a tear descended slowly
 upon his cheek, a tear so large that it magnified the pores of the
 skin over which it rolled, like the object lens of a microscope
---
that her
 confession had wrought in his life, in his universe
---
Meanwhile reillumination as to the terrible and total change, returned to him,
 and
---
he tried desperately. 
---
in which
 he stood
---
," he said, as gently as he could speak,"
---
I will walk out a little way."


---
He quietly left the room, and
---
that he had
 poured out for their supper
---
the two glasses of wine-- one for her, one for him-- remained on
 the table untasted. 
---
The closing of the door behind him, gently as it had been pulled

---
He was gone
---
for Clare walked slowly and without
 purpose
---
His form beside her light gray figure looked black,
 sinister, and forbidding, and
---
Clare turned at
, but
---
his recognition of her presence seemed
, and
---
he went on over the five yawning
 arches of the great bridge in front of the house.


---
At last, however, her listless walk brought her up alongside him, and

---
still he said nothing. 
---
it was mighty in Clare now. 
---
The outdoor air
 had apparently taken away from him all tendency to act on impulse
---
that he saw her without irradiation-- in all her bareness
---
that Time was chanting his satiric psalm at her then--


    Behold, when thy face is made bare
---
, he that loved thee
      
---
He was still intently thinking, and
---
What a
 weak thing her presence must have become to him! 
---
What have I done
---
"-- what HAVE I done! 
---
I have not told of anything
 that interferes with or belies my love for you. 
---
I
 planned it
---
what you are angry at,
 Angel
---
I am not that
 deceitful woman you think me!"


---
I have sworn; and
---
that I will
 not
---
I will do everything."


---
I was a child-- a child when it happened! 
---
I knew
 nothing of men."


---
" more sinned against than sinning, that I admit.
---
" I do forgive you, but
---
To this question he did not answer.


---
as I do you
---
"

" I am only a peasant by position, not by nature!"


---
I think. 
---
if he had held his tongue
---
Here was I thinking you a
 new- sprung child of nature
---
I
 ca n't help it."


---
; he did not love her and
.


---
as he had loved her hitherto,
---
that he obtained of their faces
---
Returning later, he passed them again in the
 same field, and as regardless of the hour
 and of the cheerless night as before. 
---
It was only on account of his
 preoccupation with his own affairs, and the illness in his house,
 that he did not bear in mind the curious incident, which, however, he
 recalled a long while after.


---
to add murder to my other follies," he said.


---
" I will leave something. 
---
that I did it myself-- on account of
 my shame
---
"

" Do n't speak so absurdly-- I wish. 
---
Angel had put it there
---
In his zest and his gaiety he had hung it there. 
---
for that
 he would relent
---
Later on that night Clare also retraced his steps to the house.

---
he obtained a light
---
who had considered his course
---
with the
 manner of one he spread his rugs upon
 the old horse- hair sofa which stood there, and. 
---
Before lying down he crept shoeless upstairs, and

---
yet he was conscious of a pang of
 bitterness at the thought-- approximately true, though not wholly

---
He turned away
---
In the act he caught sight of one of the d'Urberville
 dames, whose portrait was immediately over the entrance to Tess's
 bedchamber. 
---
so it seemed to
 him then. 
---
when he tucked it in
---
again
 he experienced the distressing sensation of a resemblance between
 them.


---
He resumed his retreat and descended.


---
His air remained calm and cold, his small compressed mouth indexing
 his powers of self- control;.

---
his face wearing still that terrible
 sterile expression which had spread thereon since her disclosure
---
It was the face of a man who was no longer passion's slave, yet. 
---
who
 found no advantage in his enfranchisement
---
He was. 
---
while that he had adored her, up to an hour
 ago
---
He argued erroneously; but
---
when he said to himself
---
, he continued, that eyes

---
He reclined on his couch in the sitting- room, and. 
---
which had already swallowed up his
 happiness
---
XXXVI


 Clare arose in the light of a dawn that was ashy and furtive,. 
---
The fireplace confronted him with its
 extinct embers
---
; the spread supper- table, whereon stood the two full
 glasses of untasted wine, now flat and filmy; her vacated seat and
 his own; the other articles of furniture, with their eternal look of
 not being able to help it, their intolerable inquiry what was to be
 done? 
---
He remembered.


---
being already dressed, he opened the window
 and. 
---
he told her
---
he searched in the back
 quarters of the house for fuel, and. 
---
his experiences at the dairy having rendered

---
him facile in domestic preparations
---
Angel cast a final glance round, and
---
He opened the front door, and.

---
When, after a short space, he came back
---
before he went
---
The marked civility of Clare's tone in calling her seemed. 
---
He spoke gently to her, and
---
He looked at her imploringly,.
---
as if he would willingly have taken a
 lie from her lips, and, by some
 sort of sophistry, a valid denial
---
" Is he living?"
---
Angel then asked.


---
" He is alive."


---
A last despair passed over Clare's face.


---
" Is he in England?"


---
He took a few vague steps.


---
"," he said abruptly. 
---
" I thought that by giving up all ambition to win a wife with
 social standing, with fortune, with knowledge of the world, I should
 secure rustic innocence as surely as I should secure pink cheeks;
 but--."


---
-- any man would
 have thought--
---
However, I am no man to reproach you, and
---
I will not
---
that he had
 lost all round
---
I should not have let;
.


---
though I hoped
---
I mean
---
How can I divorce you?"


---
"-- now I have told you? 
---
I thought.
---
", I suppose! 
---
I
 do n't know. 
---
" Indeed I can not."


---
" I thought--. 
---
I thought,"
---
" O, now I see! 
---
how wicked I
 seem to you
---
, I never thought but
! 
---
I hoped; yet
---
I believed, without a
 doubt,!"


---
"," he said.


---
" O, then I ought! 
---
But I
 had n't the courage. 
---
he took her by the hand.


---
" he inquired.


---
How?" he asked sternly.


---
" I'll tell you,!"
---
But he still held her, and,

---
his glance fall from her face downwards
---
letting, he said, 
---
You will promise me as your husband."


---
" I am ready to promise. 
---
I saw."


---
that I thought
---
I should never have. 
---
It is you, my
 ruined husband, who ought to strike the blow. 
---
I think. 
---
I should love
 you more,,,
---
I feel! 
---
I am so
 utterly worthless
---
" Well,, I wo n't. 
---
I have no wish opposed to yours."


---
He knew this. 
---
Breakfast over, he rose, and.


---
at which he might
 be expected to dinner
---
which had been his
 only practical reason for coming here
---
When he was gone
---
He sank behind it,.

---
he showed himself. 
---
although he was a
 quarter of a mile off
---
served by the time he should enter
---
He went first to the room where
 they had washed their hands together the day before, and
---
as he
 entered the sitting- room the dish- covers rose from the dishes as if
 by his own motion.


---
" How punctual!" he said.


---
I saw
---
The meal was passed in commonplace talk of what he had been doing
 during the morning at the Abbey Mill, of the methods of bolting and
 the old- fashioned machinery, which he feared would not enlighten him
 greatly on modern improved methods
---
He left the house again
 in the course of an hour,. 
---
Clare's shape appeared at the door.
---
"," he
 said. 
---
" I may think myself
 that-- indeed?
---
Well, I do n't want."


---
" I do n't know
---
It would almost
 have won round any man but Angel Clare. 
---
as he was in general
---
Within the remote depths of
 his constitution, so gentle and affectionate,
 there lay. 
---
It had blocked his acceptance of the Church
---
; it blocked
 his acceptance of Tess. 
---
Moreover, his affection itself was less fire
 than radiance, and, with regard to the other sex, when he ceased
 to believe he ceased to follow: contrasting in this with many
 impressionable natures, who remain sensuously infatuated with what
 they intellectually despise. 
---
He waited.


---
," he
 said,
---
He spoke such things as these and more of a kindred sort to her,
. 
---
it is true, underneath, a back current of
 sympathy through which a woman of the world might have conquered him
---
The firmness of her devotion to him was
 indeed almost pitiful
---
that he could say
---
It was on the third occasion of his starting after a meal
. 
---
As he was leaving the table
---
he said
" Goodbye," and
---
He did not avail himself of
 the invitation,
---
as he turned hastily aside--


---
he tried--
---
Often enough had
 to reach those lips against her consent often had he said
. 
---
that he drew sustenance
 from them, and other follies of that sort
---
But he did not care for
 them now. 
---
He observed her sudden shrinking, and. 
---
gently--

", I have
---
He went out, and
---
that he had responded yet more kindly, and
---
that he was,,
---
as he had said
---
His consistency was, indeed, too cruel. 
---
that this,
 instead of benefiting him, might be the means of hampering and
 humiliating him yet more if it should become known
---
Meanwhile Clare was meditating, verily. 
---
His thought had been
 unsuspended; he was becoming ill with thinking
---
He walked about saying to himself,
" What's to be done-- what's to be done?" and by chance she overheard
 him. 
---
I suppose--
---
while that man lives
---
he
 being your husband in nature, and not I.  If he were dead... 
---
" I can not" he said," without despising myself, and I mean whatever I feel Do n't you think?"


---
His last representation had now been made, and
---
his
 lucid picture of possible offspring was one that
 brought deadly convictions to an honest heart which was humanitarian
 to its centre. 
---
But with the
 self- combating proclivity of the supersensitive, an answer thereto
 arose in Clare's own mind, and
---
he almost feared it. 
---
reproaches were not likely to be addressed to him or to his by
 strangers
---
, they might have reached his ears from his own fastidious
 brain.


---
Some might risk the odd
 paradox that with more animalism he would have been the nobler man.

---
Yet Clare's love was doubtless ethereal to a
 fault, imaginative to impracticability. 
---
Clare had not thought of that.


---
" he inquired.


---
that I was apt to win men against their better
 judgement if I am constantly before your eyes I may cause you
; and
."

" And you would like?"
---
he asked.


---
" I want, and."


---
" I feared,
---
" I do n't complain, Angel,
---
I think it best. 
---
He was pale, even tremulous;
 but, as before, she was appalled by the determination revealed in the
 depths of this gentle being she had married-- the will to subdue the
 grosser to the subtler emotion, the substance to the conception, the
 flesh to the spirit. 
---
Propensities, tendencies, habits, were as dead
 leaves upon the tyrannous wind of his imaginative ascendency.


---
He may have observed her look, for he explained--


---
I think of people more kindly"
---
when I am away from them
---
That day he began, and
---
He knew,
 and
---
the figure of her husband crossed the
 stream of moonlight with a curiously careful tread. 
---
He was in his
 shirt and trousers only, and
---
that his eyes were fixed in an unnatural stare on vacancy
---
When he reached the middle of the room he stood still and murmured in
 tones of indescribable sadness--

" Dead!
---
Under the influence of any strongly- disturbing force, Clare would
 occasionally walk in his sleep, and. 
---
such
 as he had done on the night of their return from market just before
 their marriage, when he re- enacted in his bedroom his combat with the
 man who had insulted her
---
that continued mental distress
 had wrought him into that somnambulistic state now
---
Her loyal confidence in him lay so deep down in her heart,. 
---
that,
 awake or asleep, he inspired her with no sort of personal fear
---
If
 he had entered with a pistol in his hand
---
he would scarcely have
.


---
Clare came close, and."
---
Dead, dead, dead!" he murmured.


---
After fixedly regarding her for some moments with the same gaze of
 unmeasurable woe, he bent lower. 
---
Then lifting her from the bed with
 as much respect, he carried her
 across the room,
---
The words of endearment, withheld so severely in his waking hours,
 were inexpressibly sweet to her forlorn and hungry heart. 
---
he was going
---
" he said.


---
He paused in his labours for a moment to lean with her against the
 banister. 
---
Was he going? 
---
that he had planned
---
However, he did not let, but. 
---
Then he clasped her with a renewed firmness of hold, and

---
The creak of the loose stair did not awaken
 him, and
---
Freeing one of his
 hands from his grasp of her for a moment, he slid back the door- bar
 and. 
---
But this he seemed not
---
to mind, and, having room for
 extension in the open air, he lifted her against his shoulder, so
. 
---
that he could carry her with ease, the absence of clothes taking much
 from his burden
---
Thus he bore her off the premises in the direction
 of the river a few yards distant.


---
if he had any
---
His ultimate intention,, she had not yet divined; and

---
he was
---
as he should choose
---
that he
 really recognized her now as his wife Tess, and
---
even if in that recognition he went so far as to arrogate to himself

---
what he was dreaming of
---
Clare did not cross the bridge with her,
 but
---
which he had brought her
---
Her husband had
 possibly observed the same performance
---
; anyhow, he now mounted the
 plank, and,.


---
Was he going? 
---
Probably he was. 
---
He might drown her
---
if he would
---
there would be no more
 reproach to her, or to him for marrying her. 
---
till he awoke
---
while,
 his day- time aversion would return
---
He reached the other side with her in safety.


---
he went onward a few steps. 
---
In this
 Clare carefully laid Tess. 
---
he
 breathed deeply,
---
Clare
 then lay down on the ground alongside,. 
---
when he immediately fell into
 the deep dead slumber of exhaustion, and
---
If he were left to
 himself he would in all probability stay there till the morning, and

---
him
 know,
---
what he had been doing
---
when it would mortify him
---
To her relief, he unresistingly acquiesced
---
; her words
 had apparently thrown him back into his dream, which thenceforward
.
---
wherein he fancied, and
---
Clare was in
 his woollen stockings, and.


---
But the exhaustion of his mind and body was such that he remained
 undisturbed.


---
that Angel knew

---
, though, as regarded himself, he may have been aware that
 he had not lain still. 
---
In truth, he had awakened that morning from
 a sleep deep as annihilation; and
---
a Samson shaking himself
---
during those first few moments
, he had some dim notion of an unusual nocturnal proceeding.

---
But the realities of his situation soon displaced
---
He waited in expectancy
---
to discern some mental pointing; he knew
---
if any intention of his, concluded over- night
---
He thus beheld in the pale morning
; not as a hot and indignant
 instinct, but denuded of the passionateness which had made it scorch
 and burn; standing in its bones; nothing but a skeleton, but none the
 less there. 
---
Clare no longer hesitated.


---
,
 he showed his weariness from the night's effort so unmistakeably that
 Tess was on the point of revealing all that had happened; but the
 reflection that it would anger him, grieve him, stultify him, to know
 that he had instinctively manifested a fondness for her of which his
 common- sense did not approve, that his inclination had compromised
 his dignity when reason slept, again deterred her. 
---
It was too much
 like laughing at a man when sober for his erratic deeds during
 intoxication.


---
that he might have a faint
 recollection of his tender vagary, and was disinclined to allude to
 it from a conviction that she would take amatory advantage of the
 opportunity it gave her of appealing to him anew not to go
---
He had ordered by letter a vehicle from the nearest town, and

---
the man drove
 them off, the miller and the old waiting- woman expressing some
 surprise at their precipitate departure, which Clare attributed to
 his discovery that the mill- work was not of the modern kind which he
 wished to investigate, a statement that was true so far as it went.

---
as Clare wished
---
they could see over the stumps the spot to which Clare had
 followed her when he pressed her to be his wife; to the left the
 enclosure in which she had been fascinated by his harp; and far away
 behind the cow- stalls the mead which had been the scene of their
 first embrace. 
---
In the tacit
 agreement of husband and wife to keep their estrangement a secret
 they behaved. 
---
The later had gone
 home to her father's, and
---
till they reached the Lane inn, where
 Clare dismissed the fly and man. 
---
cross- roads, Clare
 stopped the conveyance and. 
---
that he would leave her
---
he asked her to
;

---
" Now, let," he said gently. 
---
that which I can not endure at
 present
---
I will try. 
---
I will let. 
---
where I go to as soon as I know myself
---
if I can bring
 myself
---
And to bear it--, possible-- I will come to you.

---
until I come to you
---
; he could regard her in no other light than that
 of one who had practised gross deceit upon him. 
---
I must not try?
---
" May I write to you?"


---
I hope;.
---
that I write first to you
---
I agree to the conditions, Angel;
---
fainted, wept hysterically,, he would probably not have withstood her. 
---
But her mood
 of long- suffering made his way easy for him, and
---
He
 now handed her a packet containing a fairly good sum of money, which
 he had obtained from his bankers for the purpose. 
---
if he
 understood the wording of the will)
---
(, he advised her; and
---
him send
 to a bank for safety
---
, he walked with Tess back to the carriage,
 and. 
---
he had

---
-- he bade her goodbye; and
---
Clare watched. 
---
Thus he beheld her recede,
 and
---
that he loved her still
---
It was thrown open by a stranger, not by the old man who
 had kept it for many years, and to whom she had been known
---
he had

---
" Oh-- nothing, miss," he answered. 
---
John Durbeyfield, too, hev had a daughter
 married this week to a gentleman- farmer; not from John's own house,

---
that John's own folk was not considered
---
that John is a old and ancient nobleman
 himself by blood, with family skillentons in their own vaults to
 this day
---
However, Sir John,' n now, kept up the wedding- day as well
 as he could, and; and
---
that he had been called away on business, and
---
Then where's thy husband?
---
" Oh, he's gone away for a time."


---
he gone away?"


---
" Yes, he's gone."


---
he went away!"


---
He was so good-- and
---
o' that? ' Nation seize such husbands as you seem
 to get, say I!"

" I do n't know!  that I was not But I did tell him-- I could n't help it-- and that ever
 I should ha' lived, but I say it again, you little fool!"

 I know it-- I know-- I know!"" But,
 O my mother, I could not help it!  I felt
 the wickedness of trying to blind him as to what had happened!
 If-- if-- it were to be done again-- I should do the same.  I could
 not-- I dared not!"

" But you sinned enough!"


---
But I thought he could get
 rid o' me by law. 
---
if he were determined
---
And O, if
 you knew-- if you could only half know how I loved him-- how anxious I
 was-- and how wrung I was between caring so much for him
 and my wish to be fair to him!"

 I'm sure I do n't know why
 children o' my bringing forth should all be bigger simpletons than
 other people's-- not to know better than to blab such a thing as
 when he could n't ha' found it out till too late
---
What your father will say
---
";
" for he's been talking about the wedding up at Rolliver's and The
 Pure Drop every day since, and
---
his family getting back to their
 rightful position through you-- poor silly man!--and
---
As if to bring matters to a focus, Tess's father was heard
. 
---
He did
---
Mrs Durbeyfield said. 
---
Presently her father entered,. 
---
He was a foot- haggler now,
---
he travelled with his basket on his arm. 
---
that he was in his work
---
" Durbeyfield began, and
---
originated by the fact of his daughter having
 married into a clerical family
---
," he said," though nowadays their true style
---
, he had mentioned no
 particulars. 
---
He hoped. 
---
He
 proposed. 
---
He asked.


---
Then Mrs Durbeyfield informed him, but
---
When at length the collapse was explained to him
---
, a sullen
 mortification, not usual with Durbeyfield, overpowered the influence
 of the cheering glass. 
---
Yet the intrinsic quality of the event moved
 his touchy sensitiveness less than its conjectured effect upon the
 minds of others.


---
to be the end" said Sir John.

---
I feel
---
; I shall put an end to myself, title and all
---
-- I can bear
 it no longer!... 
---
him keep her her
---
if he's
---
he really have married her
---
if her
 father doubted her a little
---
which had arisen
 between the young husband and wife
---
It was three weeks after the marriage that Clare found himself
 descending the hill which led to the well- known parsonage of his
 father. 
---
With his downward course the tower of the church rose into
 the evening sky in a manner of inquiry as to why he had come; and
---
He was arriving like a ghost, and
---
the sound of his
 own footsteps was almost an encumbrance to be got rid of.


---
The picture of life had changed for him. 
---
he had

---
Before this time known it but speculatively; now he thought;. 
---
he knew it as a practical
 man
---
though perhaps he did not, even yet
---
Nevertheless humanity
 stood before him no longer in the pensive sweetness of Italian art,
 but in the staring and ghastly attitudes of a Wiertz Museum, and with
 the leer of a study by Van Beers.


---
His conduct during these first weeks had been desultory beyond
 description. 
---
as though nothing unusual had happened, in
 the manner recommended by the great and wise men of all ages
---
After mechanically attempting to pursue his
 agricultural plans, he
 concluded.

---
that very few of those great and wise men had ever gone so
 far outside themselves
---
That was just Clare's own opinion. 
---
But he was perturbed. 
---
Clare chimed in cordially; but
---
his heart was troubled all the same.

---
How he would have liked, and

---
His mood transmuted itself into a dogged indifference till at length

---
he fancied.


---
he was looking on his own existence with the passive
 interest of an outsider
---
He was embittered by the conviction that all this desolation had been
 brought about by the accident of her being a d'Urberville. 
---
When he
 found
---
as he had fondly dreamed
---
was not of
 the new tribes from below,, why had he not
 stoically abandoned her in fidelity to his principles? 
---
what
 he had got by apostasy
---
his punishment was deserved.


---
Then he became weary and anxious, and
---
his anxiety increased. 
---
He
 wondered. 
---
if he had treated her unfairly
---
He ate without knowing that
 he ate, and drank without tasting. 
---
as the
 motive of each act in the long series of bygone days presented itself
 to his view
---
, he perceived.


---
how intimately the notion of having Tess as
 a dear possession was mixed up with all his schemes and words and
 ways
---
In going hither and thither he observed in the outskirts of a small
 town a red- and- blue placard setting forth the great advantages of
 the Empire of Brazil as a field for the emigrating agriculturist.

---
Brazil
 somewhat attracted him as a new idea. 
---
In brief he was strongly
 inclined to try Brazil,.


---
With this view he was returning to Emminster. 
---
he could make of
 arriving without Tess,
---
As he reached the door the new moon shone upon his face
---
when he
 had carried his wife in his arms across the river to the graveyard
 of the monks
---
his face was thinner now.


---
Clare had given his parents no warning of his visit, and
---
his arrival
 stirred the atmosphere of the Vicarage as the dive of the kingfisher
. 
---
His father and mother were both in the
 drawing- room, but
---
neither of his brothers was now at home. 
---
Angel
 entered, and.


---
I have come home rather in a
 hurry.
---
because I've decided
---
I had n't thought of that."


---
his going to a Papistical
 land
---
announcing," said Mrs Clare," and
---
your father sent your godmother's gift
 to her,. 
---
Yet I wish. 
---
I could have seen her first, Angel, or have
 known a little more about her
---
He replied.


---
whilst he came there
---
" I do n't mind. 
---
," he said,"
---
that I always
 meant
---
till I should feel
---
If I do go
---
till I come back
---
" And I shall not see her?"


---
He was afraid they would not. 
---
His original plan had been,; and for other
 reasons he had adhered to it. 
---
as he had

---
He would have,; and
---
if he went out at once
---
before he started a second time-- with her
---
Clare made further
 exposition of his plans. 
---
His mother's disappointment at not seeing
 the bride still remained with her. 
---
Clare's late enthusiasm for Tess
 had infected her through her maternal sympathies,.
---
as he ate
---
I am sure she is very pretty, Angel.
---
" he said, with a zest which
 covered its bitterness.


---
" I can see her quite distinctly. 
---
And living in such seclusion scarce ever seen any young man from the world without.
---
His father was less inquisitive; but
---
since Angel has come
---
" I think,,?"

" Yes, certainly," said Mrs Clare. 
---
" My dear son,
 your father has decided. 
---
A lump rose in Clare's throat. 
---
Angel's father began
---
he praiseth her. 
---
When prayers were over, his mother said--


---
" I could not help. 
---
he praiseth her. 
---
Well, I wish. 
---
I
 could have seen her, Angel
---
Clare could bear this no longer. 
---
His eyes were full of tears, which
 seemed like drops of molten lead. 
---
He bade a quick good night to
 these sincere and simple souls whom he loved so well; who knew
 neither the world, the flesh, nor the devil in their own hearts, only
 as something vague and external to themselves. 
---
He went to his own
 chamber.


---
Clare opened it to
.


---
"," said he.


---
, I know
---
that-- I know
---
"," he said. 
---
" But we have had a
 difference--"

" Angel--
---
Mrs Clare had put her finger on the kind of
 trouble that would cause such a disquiet as seemed to agitate her
 son.


---
he replied; and
---
if it had sent him to
 eternal hell there
---
and then he would have told that lie.


---
Such terrible sarcasm of blind magnanimity brought home to Clare the
 secondary perception that he had utterly wrecked his career by this
 marriage, which had not been among his early thoughts after the
 disclosure. 
---
True, on his own account he cared very little about his
 career; but
---
he had wished. 
---
as he looked into
---
And now the
 candle its flame dumbly expressed to him.


---
When his agitation had cooled
---
he would be at moments incensed with
 his poor wife for causing a situation in which he was obliged to
 practise deception on his parents. 
---
He almost talked to her in his
 anger,. 
---
And then her cooing voice,
 plaintive in expostulation, disturbed the darkness, the velvet touch
 of her lips passed over his brow, and
---
he could distinguish in the air
 the warmth of her breath.


---
how
 great and good her husband was
---
which Angel Clare perceived,
---
With all his attempted independence of
 judgement this advanced and well- meaning young man, a sample product
 of the last five- and- twenty years, was yet the slave to custom and
 conventionality. 
---
No
 prophet had told him, and
---
he was not prophet enough to tell himself,
. 
---
In considering
, he overlooked, and.




---
After breakfast Clare went into the little town, and. 
---
as he was concerned with there
---
he possessed
---
On his way back he
 encountered Miss Mercy Chant by the church, from whose walls she
 seemed to be a sort of emanation. 
---
although, in the opinion of Angel, it was obtained
 by a curiously unnatural sacrifice of humanity to mysticism
---
that he was about to leave England
---
,"
 he replied. 
---
" Why, you wicked man, a cloister implies a monk, and a monk Roman
 Catholicism."


---
in which a man does
---
he could think of. 
---
His momentary laughter at the horror ceased.


---
when it merged in pain and anxiety
 for his welfare
---
," he said,
---
I think!"


---
I am going
 crazy
---
that he was
---
With the local banker he deposited the
 jewels till happier days
---
He also paid into the bank
 thirty pounds-- to be sent to Tess in a few months, as she might
 require; and. 
---
what he had done
---
he had

---
, with the sum already placed in her hands-- about fifty pounds-- he hoped
---
This amount would be
 amply sufficient for her wants just at present, particularly as in
 an emergency she had been directed to apply to his father.


---
He deemed it best; and,. 
---
being unaware of to estrange the two, neither his father nor his
 mother suggested
---
that he should do so
---
During the day he left the
 parsonage, for what he had to complete he wished to get done quickly.


---
for him to call at the Wellbridge farmhouse, in which he had spent
 with Tess the first three days of their marriage, the trifle of rent

---
that the deepest shadow ever thrown
 upon his life
---
when he had

---
which returned first upon him
---
The farmer and his wife were in the field at the moment of his visit,
 and
---
Clare was in the rooms alone for some time. 
---
that he had not quite reckoned with
---
Inwardly swollen
 with a renewal of sentiment, he
 went upstairs to her chamber, which had never been his. 
---
just as he had placed
 it
---
Angel took it down and. 
---
Standing there, he for the first time doubted
 whether his course in this conjecture had been a wise, much less
 a generous, one. 
---
But had he not been cruelly blinded? 
---
In the
 incoherent multitude of his emotions he knelt down at the bedside
 wet- eyed. 
---
, I would have

---
he mourned.


---
Hearing a footstep below, he rose and.

---
At the bottom of the flight he saw, and
---
Mr Clare I've called. 
---
who had not yet
 guessed his; an honest girl who loved him-- one who would have made as
 good, or nearly as good, a practical farmer's wife as Tess.


---
," he said;"
---
why he had come
---
, he asked," Izz?"


---
" I have no home at Talbothays Dairy now, sir
---
He soon found the farmer, and. 
---
," he said,
---
he inquired. 
---
Her black eyes flashed up to his face for one moment by way of
 answer.


---
" Izz!--how weak of you-- for such as I!" he said, and. "
---
Clare slowed the horse. 
---
He was incensed against his fate, bitterly
 disposed towards social ordinances; for they had cooped him up in a
 corner, out of which there was no legitimate pathway. 
---
," said he. 
---
" I have separated from
 my wife for personal, not voyaging, reasons. 
---
I may never live with
 her again. 
---
I may not be able to love you; but
---
" I do. 
---
I have been badly used enough. 
---
" Yes-- I will go
---
He drove past the cross- roads, one mile, two miles, without showing
 any signs of affection.


---
" he suddenly asked.


---
I do
---
Clare was silent
---
; his heart had risen at these straightforward words
 from such an unexpected unimpeachable quarter. 
---
His ears repeated,
---
I COULD DO NO MORE!"

," he said,
---
" I do n't know! 
---
what I've been saying
---
I will now drive
 you back to where your lane branches off."


---
O-- how can I bear it--
---
can I
---
Perhaps I did n't know! 
---
what I was saying, either,
 wh--
---
when I agreed
---
I wish--!"


---
Because I have a loving wife already
---
he cried. 
---
He felt.


---
how richly he deserved the reproach that the wounded cry
 conveyed, and, in a sorrow that was inexpressible, leapt down and
 took her hand
---
I've had
---
" I forgive' ee, sir!"
---
," he said,;"
---
he was far from feeling
---
" Now, Izz forcing
 himself to the mentor's part I want you to
. 
---
that there are
 more worthy men than I in the world
---
I send this message to them as a dying man to the dying;. 
---
for I shall
 never see them again
---
they are not so bad as men in
 these things! 
---
On that one account I can never forget you. 
---
He drove on; but
---
Clare
 was out of sight,; and
---
Clare, too, after bidding the girl farewell, was wrought to aching
 thoughts and quivering lips. 
---
But his sorrow was not for Izz. 
---
he was within a feather- weight's turn of abandoning his road
 to the nearest station, and driving across that elevated dorsal line
 of South Wessex which divided him from his Tess's home. 
---
It was
 neither a contempt for her nature, nor the probable state of her
 heart, which deterred him.


---
If he was right at first
---
,
 he was right now. 
---
on which he
 had embarked
---
unless diverted by
 a stronger, more sustained force than had played upon him this
 afternoon
---
He could soon come back to her. 
---
He took the train.




---
us press on to
 an October day, more than eight months subsequent to the parting
 of Clare and Tess
---
that were projected by her husband for her comfort through
 this probationary period
---
which had remained to her of Clare's
 allowance
---
Angel had put them into her hand,

---
had obtained them bright and new from his bank for her; his touch had
 consecrated them to souvenirs of himself
---
than such as was created by his and her own
 experiences
---
As
 her husband was a man of means, and
---
, a remark of Angel's to apply to his father, remained.


---
whatever it may be
 called, on Clare's account, which had led her to hide from her own
 parents the prolongation of the estrangement,
---
him
 know her state
---
Her reluctance to communicate with her husband's parents might,
 she thought, lessen with the lapse of time; but
---
On her leaving their house after the short visit
 subsequent to her marriage they were under the impression that she
 was ultimately going to join her husband; and
---
that his journey
 to Brazil would result in a short stay only, after which he would
 come to fetch her, or that he would write for her to join him
---
Where Clare had
 deposited them and
---
Meanwhile her husband's days had been by no means free from trial.

---
At this moment he was lying ill of fever in the clay lands near
 Curitiba in Brazil,
---
her return might bring reproach upon
 her idolized husband. 
---
With the shortening of the days all hope of obtaining her husband's
 forgiveness began; and
---
because, for one thing, it was
 nearer to the home of her husband's father; and
---
He stepped up alongside Tess and
 said--

"
---
The man turned and.


---
though your fancy- man was so up about it
---
Solomon had thought
 as far as that more than two thousand years ago
---
where several
 young men were troublesomely complimentary to her good looks
---
because Angel is not here, and
---
My husband is gone away, and; but
---
HE married you-- and
---
And he's none. 
---
My husband has gone abroad, and somehow I have overrun my
 allowance, so that I have to fall back upon my old work for a time.

---
because he's away
---
if he were here
---
even if he gie'd ye no money
---
even if he used you like a drudge
---
who
 represented him this evening
---
its cheapness made it profitable for tasks
 which women could perform as readily as men.


---
a letter should arrive at Marlott from her husband
---
Patience, that blending of moral courage with
 physical timidity, was now no longer a minor feature in Mrs Angel
 Clare; and
---
upheld by the dignity
 of being Angel's wife, in the letter at least
---
Then we could bring up Talbothays every day here
 afield, and talk of he, and of what nice times we had there, and o'
 the old things we used to know, and make it all come back a'most, in
 seeming!" 
---
; gaunt spectral creatures
 with tragical eyes-- eyes being had ever conceived, in curdling temperatures that no man could
 endure; beheld the crash of icebergs and the slide of
 snow- hills by the shooting light of the Aurora;
---
if he could only see his
 pretty wife now
---
" You must n't talk about him to me, Marian
---
They did all kinds of men's work by preference, including
 well- sinking, hedging, ditching, and excavating, without any sense of
 fatigue. 
---
When he had dismounted
---
he came close to
 Tess, and. 
---
his fixed attitude led her,
.


---
that her employer was the native of Trantridge
 from whom she had taken flight on the high- road because of his
 allusion to her history
---
He waited? 
---
when he said,"
---
if I did n't think
---
you had got the better
 of me the first time at the inn with your fancy- man,
---
now I think." 
---
I've got the
 better you
---
He concluded with a hard laugh.


---
to know by this time; it was rather the
 tyranny induced by his mortification at Clare's treatment of him.

---
I was in love with' ee
---
I suppose? 
---
" I think."


---
I have not. 
---
And I thought, and
---
I want.
---
" I am going."


---
He looked sullenly at her and. 
---
" Izz and Marian," said Mrs Angel Clare, with a dignity which was
 extremely touching,
---
I
 ca n't join in talk with you now,, about Mr Clare
---
as I used
---
that I can not
---
although he is gone away from me for
 the present
---
because,, he is my husband
---
He was a very splendid lover, no doubt
---
he is a too fond husband to go away from you
 so soon
---
" He had--
---
to go he was obliged!"
---
" He might have tided' ee over the winter."


---
" Perhaps
 there's a good deal to be said for him! 
---
He did not go away, like
 some husbands, without telling me; and
---
where
 he is
---
," he said to her.


---
I want
---
"," he said doggedly,.


---
as he crossed the barn and

---
Do n't' ee mind him
---
his having YOU
---
" Is it about my husband?"
---
what he wanted
---
He wanted."


---
Anyhow he changed his mind.
---
" Pooh-- then he did n't mean it! 
---
Yes he did
---
"; for he drove her a good- ways towards the station."


---
" He did n't take her!"


---
He said, but
---
I could not
 go to him
---
he did n't say.

---
I was not
---
as I liked
---
I wo n't dally like this any longer! 
---
I have been very wrong and
 neglectful in leaving everything to be done by him!"


---
so shortly after he had left her
---
It was through her husband's parents. 
---
But that sense of morally no claim upon him had always led Tess; and
---
her husband not written
 to her
---
He had distinctly implied; but
---
that he would at least let her
 know of the locality to which he had journeyed
---
he had not sent a
 line. 
---
Was he really indifferent? 
---
But was he
 ill? 
---
If Angel's father were the good
 man she had heard him represented to be
---
, he would be able to enter
 into her heart- starved situation. 
---
that
 the journey concerned her husband
---
when momentarily tempted by Clare
---
but a day, that Clare had married Tess, and
 only a few days less than a year.

---
that he had been absent from her
---
that at that moment the
 Vicar and his congregation were gathered
---
Such a good man might be prejudiced against a woman who
 had chosen Sunday,.

---
her husband saying
---
that his father always insisted upon
 the household
---
The pedestrians were his two brothers.

---
It was the woman who had been destined for
 Angel's life- companion by his and her parents, and whom he probably
 would have married but for her intrusive self. 
---
He never tells me anything nowadays. 
---
I never see that nice girl without more and more regretting his
 precipitancy in throwing himself away upon a dairymaid, or whatever
 she may be.  not I do n't know when I heard from him" I ca n't say.  His
 ill- considered marriage seems."


---
which was begun by his extraordinary opinions
---
During their discourse one of the clerical brothers probed the hedge
 carefully with his umbrella, and.


---
" Here's a pair of old boots," he said. 
---
" Thrown away, I suppose, by
 some tramp or other."


---
Cuthbert Clare,, picked them up for
 her with the crook of his stick; and
---
HE bought for me
---
that HE chose the colour
---
for they do n't care much for him,
---
Her present condition was
 precisely one which would have enlisted the sympathies of old Mr and
 Mrs Clare. 
---
His voice became so distinct in the still clear air that she could
 soon catch his sentences,. 
---
for he
 had plainly no skill as a dialectician
---
how he had come by

---
He had. 
---
, he said,
---
He had
 scoffed
---
; he had wantonly associated with the reckless and the lewd.

---
in a human sense, it had been
 brought about mainly by the influence of a certain clergyman, whom he
 had at first grossly insulted; but
---
whose parting words had sunk into
 his heart, and.


---
they
 had worked this change in him, and
---
what they saw him
---
so that the rays stretched far in over
 the threshing- floor to the preacher and his audience
---
The listeners were entirely
 villagers, among them being the man whom she had seen carrying the
 red paint- pot on a former memorable occasion. 
---
though he stood there openly and palpably a
 converted man, who was sorrowing for his past irregularities, a fear

---
now he wore neatly trimmed, old- fashioned whiskers, the
 sable moustache having disappeared; and
---
his dress was half- clerical,
 a modification which had changed his expression sufficiently to
 abstract the dandyism from his features, and to hinder for a second
 her belief in his identity.


---
his face had used
---
when his wishes were thwarted now
---
who would insist upon
 turning again to his wallowing in the mire
---
D'Urberville was not the first wicked man who had turned
 away from his wickedness to save his soul alive, and
---
He
 had obviously not discerned her yet in her position against the sun.


---
But the moment he recognized her. 
---
The effect
 upon her old lover was electric, far stronger than the effect of his
 presence upon her. 
---
His fire, the tumultuous ring of his eloquence,
 seemed. 
---
His lip struggled and; but
---
His eyes, after their first glance upon her face, hung
 confusedly in every other direction but hers, but
---
He was now on the
 side of the Spirit,. 
---
that her Cyprian image had suddenly appeared
 upon his altar, whereby the fire of the priest had been well nigh
 extinguished.


---
that he was excited, less by the speed of his
 walk than by the feelings within him
---
" Tess!" he said.


---
" Tess!" he repeated. 
---
he came up.


---
I see
---
," he added,
 with a slight laugh,
---
," he returned grimly,,
---
said he indifferently."
---
as I have
 been telling my hearers
---
what I have poured upon
 myself
---
I can tell you the means by which my
 conversion was brought about, and. 
---
I hope
---
with which I have thrown in my lot,
---
I only differ from him on the question of Church and
 State-- the interpretation of the text,'. 
---
He is one who, I firmly
 believe, has been the humble means of saving more souls in this
 country than any other man you can name. 
---
You have heard of him?"


---
I have
---
" He came to Trantridge two or three years ago; and
---
when, in his disinterestedness, he tried
---
He did not resent my conduct
---
, he simply said. 
---
that
 some day I should receive the first- fruits of the Spirit--
---
There was a strange
 magic in his words. 
---
by degrees I was brought.

---
I was trying
---
that I have preached hereabout
---
, Tess, the pleasure of having a
 good slap at yourself, I am sure--"

!"
---
" I
 ca n't believe in such sudden things! 
---
I feel indignant with you for
 talking to me like this, when you know-- when you know what harm
 you've done me! 
---
Out upon such-- I do n't believe in you
---
-- I hate it!"


---
," he insisted;
---
Who is this better man?"


---
" I can not tell you."


---
" Well," he declared, a resentment beneath his words seeming ready to
 spring out at a moment's notice,"-- and
---
that I should say
---
I am
 a good man
---
I do n't say any such thing
---
I am new to
 goodness, truly; but
---
; whereupon his eyes, falling casually upon
 the familiar countenance and form, remained. 
---
The
 inferior man was quiet in him now; but
---
he said abruptly.


---
stammering with
 a flush," I beg your pardon!" 
---
to dictate like this," he went on;" but

---
that I should not look too often on you
---
how far he was
 going with her, and
---
if he knew
---
He told her.


---
that the man was employed by himself and
 others who were working with him in that district,
---
," he remarked,. 
---
D'Urberville was struck mute. 
---
he next murmured. 
---
he broke the silence by adding:" Well-- you
 will see me again.
---
He stepped up to the
 pillar. 
---
," he continued;". 
---
He turned to a hunting- gate in the hedge and, without letting his
 eyes again rest upon her, leapt over and struck out across the down
 in the direction of Abbot's- Cernel. 
---
As he walked
---
his pace showed
 perturbation, and by- and- by,,

---
he drew from his pocket a small book, between the leaves of which
 re- reading.

---
D'Urberville opened the letter. 
---
was signed by Parson Clare
---
The letter began by expressing the writer's unfeigned joy at
 d'Urberville's conversion, and. 
---
It expressed Mr
 Clare's warm assurance of forgiveness for d'Urberville's former
 conduct and his interest in the young man's plans for the future.

---
He, Mr Clare, would much have liked, and
 but

---
whose ministry he had devoted so many years of his own life
---
him to enter a theological college to that end
---
since his correspondent had possibly not cared
---
to do this on account
 of the delay, he was not the man. 
---
Every man must work as he could best
 work, and in the method towards which he felt impelled by the Spirit.


---
D'Urberville read and re- read this letter, and. 
---
He also read some passages from memoranda apparently the image of Tess
---
as he walked

---
till his face assumed a calm, and
---
no
 longer troubled his mind.


---
It
 was put up in wuld times by the relations of a malefactor who was
 tortured there by nailing his hand to a post and afterwards hung.

---
he sold his soul to the devil,
 and
---
that he walks at times
---
the clear unconcerned voice of the young
 woman, in response to the warmer accents of the man, spread into the
 chilly air as the one soothing thing within the dusky horizon, full
 of a stagnant obscurity upon which nothing else intruded. 
---
the
 young man walking off in embarrassment
---
" He is Amby Seedling, the chap who used to sometimes come and help at
 Talbothays
---
" He actually inquired and
. 
---
He says. 
---
he's

---
But I've hardly answered him."



 Opposite its front was a long mound or" grave",. 
---
A man was turning the handle of the machine, and
---
The man at the slicer, having nothing else to do with
 his eyes, continually observed the comer, but
---
till her companion directed her attention to his
 approach
---
; it was one in a
 semi- clerical costume, who now represented what had once been the
 free- and- easy Alec d'Urberville. 
---
Not being hot at his preaching
 there was less enthusiasm about him now, and
---
D'Urberville came up and quietly--

."


---
" I want, Tess
---
He glanced round. 
---
if he were overheard
---
They were at some
 distance from the man who turned the slicer, and
---
the movement of the
 machine, too, sufficiently prevented Alec's words reaching other
 ears. 
---
D'Urberville placed himself.


---
"," he continued, with capricious compunction. 
---
he watched her inquiringly, as, with bent
 head. 
---
," he added, with a sigh of discontent,--"yours
---
to say," d'Urberville went on. 
---
He drew a piece of parchment from his pocket, with a slight fumbling
 of embarrassment.


---
as he asked the question a disappointment which was not entirely

---
And the disappointment of thwarted duty crossed d'Urberville's face. 
---
It
 was unmistakably a symptom that something of his old passion for her
 had been revived;
---
" Surely," he began again, in more impetuous tones, and.


---
When they reached the first newly- ploughed
 section he held out his hand to help her over it; but
---
he
 repeated, as soon as they were over the furrows.


---
" I can not."


---
" I have no affection for you."


---
" I love somebody else."


---
" he cried. 
---
" Anyhow, then, your love for this other man may be
---
" I can not tell you."


---
" Well then... I have married him."


---
" Ah!" he exclaimed; and
---
he stopped dead and.


---
" I did not wish--
---
I did not mean to!"
---
For a moment a flash of his old irony marked his face; but
---
he
 determinedly chastened it down.


---
" Is that man your husband?"
---
he asked mechanically,.


---
D'Urberville was disturbed.


---
he retorted hotly. 
---
' The
 unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and
---
" But I only asked for your sake!"" Angels of
 heaven!--God forgive me for such an expression-- I came here, I swear,
 as I thought for your good.  Tess-- don't look at me so-- I can not
 stand your looks!  There-- I wo n't lose my head; I dare not.
 I own.  But I thought
.  the unbelieving
 wife is sanctified by the husband,'
---
He moodily reflected with his eyes on the ground.


---
I said to myself.  I must bear the disappointment!"

," he added, quite
 calmly,
---
whoever he may be
---
Is he on this farm?"


---
" He is far away."


---
What sort of husband can he be?"


---
He found out--"

... 
---
" He does not leave me!"
---
" He do n't know it! 
---
" Then, does he write?"


---
that he does not
---
my
 fair Tess--"

 In an impulse he turned suddenly
---
he seized only the rough leather fingers which did not
 express the life or shape of those within.


---
" Yes, yes; I will," he said abruptly, and. 
---
he turned
---
Facing round, however, he said,"!"


---
what was their business in his
 field
---
said d'Urberville, his face
 blackening with something that was not Christianity.


---
" Go-- I do beg you!"
---
" He wo n't hurt me. 
---
HE'S not in love with me. 
---
Her defender, having
 reluctantly disappeared, the farmer continued his reprimand, which
 Tess took with the greatest coolness, that sort of attack being
 independent of sex. 
---
if he had dared
---
"," he growled. 
---
that he did not harass the other women of the
 farm
---
as he harassed her out of spite for the flooring he had once
 received
---
He is so unpleasant
 to me."


---
; he
 had asked Izz, and
---
perhaps he did not care for her at
 all. 
---
if it would ever
 reach Angel's hands
---
when d'Urberville's figure darkened the
 window of the cottage
---
D'Urberville's knock, his walk up
 to the door, had some indescribable quality of difference from his
 air. 
---
He came in,.


---
" Tess-- I could n't help it!"
---
he began desperately,. 
---
as he wiped his
 heated face, which had also a superimposed flush of excitement
---
" I
 felt. 
---
that I must call at least
---
I assure you
---
I
 had not been thinking of you at all
---
till I saw you that Sunday
---
; now I
 can not get rid of your image,
---
I may
---
The suppressed discontent of his manner was almost pitiable, and
---
" How can I pray for you?"


---
that the great Power would alter His plans on my
 account
---
What believe in these matters, Tess?" he asked. 
---
" But I have. 
---
Though I do n't believe in anything supernatural."


---
D'Urberville looked at her with misgiving.


---
I take
---
yet I've felt so sure about it
---
" H'm-- and," he said uneasily.


---
" I believe in the SPIRIT of the Sermon on the Mount, and
---
so did my
 dear husband... 
---
But I do n't
---
"," said d'Urberville drily,". 
---
whatever your dear husband
 believed, and, without the
 least inquiry or reasoning on your own part
---
whatever he rejected
---
Your mind is enslaved to his.
---
because he knew everything
---
A pretty fellow he must be!"


---
" He never forced my judgement! 
---
He would never argue on the subject
 with me! 
---
what he believed
---
" What used he? 
---
He must have said something?"


---
d'Urberville thoughtfully murmured the
 words after her.


---
" he presently asked.

"
---
He said at another time something like this"; and
---
" I wanted,;
 and
---
what he believed
---
though he did n't wish me to
---
I managed. 
---
I ca n't
 say; but
---
I quite understand that one
---
I know.
---
He fell into thought.


---
" And so I threw in my spiritual lot with his
---
" I
 did n't wish. 
---
What's good enough for him
---
" Does he know?"


---
that you are as big an infidel as he
---
" No-- I never told him--."


---
if I am an infidel
---
that I am, Tess, after all
---
I do believe
---
I ought

---
like the devils, I believe and."


---
I
 suddenly leave off, and
---
," he said aridly;
---
" Why" I have come all the way here to see you
 to- day! 
---
But I started from home and
---
where
 I have undertaken
---
He drew from his breast- pocket
---
a poster whereon was printed the day,
 hour, and place of meeting, at which he, d'Urberville, would preach
 the Gospel as aforesaid.


---
he said, with a soulless sneer in the word. 
---
I ask myself,
---
He laid his hand on
 her shoulder. 
---
" Tess, my girl, I was on the way to, at least, social
 salvation!"
---
till I saw you again
---
he said. 
---
I was firm
!" 
---
as a man could be
---
till I saw those eyes and
---
His voice sank,
 and
---
a hot archness shot from his own black eyes. 
---
";-- I could not resist you as
!"


---
soon as I met you again
---
" I could n't help!"
---
whilst he it seems!"


---
" Do n't speak against him-- he is absent!"
---
" Treat him honourably-- he has never wronged you! 
---
that may do to his
 honest name
---
"," he said, like a man awakening from a luring dream.

---
" I have broken my engagement
---
A month ago I should have been horrified at such a
 possibility. 
---
I'll go away--."

---
ah, can I!
---
Only for old friendship--"

" I am without defence.
---
A good man's honour is in my keeping--

---
He clenched his lips,. 
---
His
 eyes were equally barren of worldly and religious faith. 
---
which had lain inanimate amid the lines
 of his face
---
ever since his reformation seemed and. 
---
He went out indeterminately.


---
Though d'Urberville had declared
---
that this breach of his engagement
 to- day was the simple backsliding of a believer, Tess's words,
---
after he had left her
---
He moved on in silence, as
. 
---
if his energies were benumbed by the hitherto undreamt- of possibility
 that his position was untenable
---
Reason had had nothing to do with
 his whimsical conversion, which was perhaps the mere freak of a
 careless man in search of a new sensation, and temporarily impressed
 by his mother's death.


---
He said to himself,
," That clever fellow little thought that, by
 telling her those things, he might be paving my way back to her!"




---
as he pondered again and again over the crystallized phrases that she
 had handed on to him
---
to which,, there were presently added the silhouettes of two
 men on the summit. 
---
By the engine stood a dark, motionless
 being, a sooty and grimy embodiment of tallness, in a sort of trance,
 with a heap of coals by his side: it was the engine- man. 
---
The
 isolation of his manner and colour lent him the appearance of a
 creature from Tophet, who had strayed into the pellucid smokelessness
 of this region of yellow grain and pale soil, with which he had
 nothing in common, to amaze and to discompose its aborigines.


---
What he looked. 
---
he felt
---
He was in the agricultural world, but not of
 it. 
---
He served fire and smoke
---
He travelled with his engine
 from farm to farm, from county to county, for as yet. 
---
He spoke in
 a strange northern accent
---
; his thoughts being turned inwards upon
 himself, his eye on his iron charge, hardly perceiving the scenes
 around him, and caring for them not at all. 
---
as if some ancient doom
 compelled him
---
which ran from the driving- wheel of
 his engine to the red thresher under the rick
---
While they uncovered the sheaves he stood apathetic beside his
 portable repository of force, round whose hot blackness the morning
 air quivered. 
---
He had nothing to do with preparatory labour. 
---
His
 fire was waiting incandescent
---
, his steam was at high pressure, in
 a few seconds he could make the long strap move at an invisible
 velocity. 
---
; it was all the same to him. 
---
If any of the autochthonous
 idlers asked him
---
what he called himself
---
, he replied shortly," an
 engineer."


---
; the men then took their
 places
---
as
 they called him
---
," he"-- had arrived ere this, and;.


---
The old men on the rising straw- rick talked of the past days
;. 
---
; for,, the man could not stop,
---
Groby gave as his motive in
, and
---
He was
, and
---
he twirled a gay
 walking- cane.


---
" Well-- this is the same man."


---
But he's quite different!
---
" He hev left off his black coat and white neckercher, and; but
---
hev cut off
 his whiskers
---
he's the same man for all that."


---
" Oh-- he can do her no harm
---
that he had restored
 himself, to the old jaunty, slapdash guise under which Tess
 had first known her admirer, and cousin so- called. 
---
as nearly as a man could do,
---
He strode across
 them, and.


---
"," said d'Urberville
---
" I trouble YOU? 
---
I think?
---
I may ask,
---
" Sure, I do n't trouble you any- when!"


---
He regarded her silently for a few moments, and
---
that, he would
 have let
---
D'Urberville rose and
. 
---
As for what you said last time, on the strength of
 your wonderful husband's intelligence-- whose name you have never told
 me-- about having what they call an ethical system without any dogma,
 I do n't see my way to that at all."

" Why, you can have the religion of loving- kindness and purity at
 least,
---
that he had mixed in his dull
 brain two matters, theology and morals,
---
I'm a different sort of fellow from that!  I ca n't warm up Hang it, I am not going; and if I were you, my dear,
 I would n't either!"

" Well, never mind," he resumed. 
---
Your husband little thought! 
---
how his teaching would recoil upon
 him
---
," he said,
---
" I did not come. 
---
I came Tess,, and
---
that I do n't like you
---
I have come on purpose for you. 
---
you
 have a husband who is not I. 
---
but I've never
 seen him, and
---
you've not told me his name; and rather a mythological personage. 
---
altogether he seems

---
However,, I
 think. 
---
I am nearer to you than he is
---
I, at any rate, try, but
---
he does not, bless his invisible face! 
---
I used
---
I will go and
---
shall
 not find him return to my first
 husband; for then was it better with me than now!'... 
---
while he spoke
---
," he continued,;
---
stretching
 his arm towards her waist" you should be willing to share it, and

---
you call husband for ever."


---
it struck him flat on the
 mouth. 
---
Alec
 fiercely started up from his reclining position. 
---
But he soon controlled
 himself,.


---
" O no, no, Tess," he said blandly. 
---
" I can make full allowance for
 this. 
---
that I would have

---
Did I
 not ask you flatly? 
---
His voice hardened

---
as his temper got the better of him with the recollection of his
 sincerity in asking her and her present ingratitude, and
---
he stepped
 across to her side and. 
---
" Remember, my lady, I was your master once! 
---
I will
 be your master again. 
---
If you are any man's wife
---
," he said,
---
" Now I shall
 leave you, and.

---
But I know you."


---
D'Urberville
 retreated over the sheaves, and. 
---
the man with the engine was engaged for another farm on
 the morrow. 
---
He had seen, and.

---
while he blew her a kiss
---
But
 the unthreshed sheaves remaining untouched seemed countless still,
 notwithstanding the enormous numbers that had been gulped down by
 the insatiable swallower, fed by the man and Tess, through whose two
 young hands the greater part of them had passed. 
---
The man was weary, and

---
that the red nape of his neck was encrusted with dirt
 and husks
---
that Alec d'Urberville was still on the scene,,
---
his remaining
---
men
 unconnected with the threshing sometimes dropped in for that
 performance-- sporting characters of all descriptions, gents with
 terriers and facetious pipes, roughs with sticks and stones
---
since d'Urberville had begun
---
he did not wish, and
---
The" friend" was d'Urberville,
. 
---
" I should indeed be foolish," he answered, in the seductive voice of the Trantridge time.

---
since I arrived
---
However, I have told the farmer. 
---
that
 he has no right to employ women at steam- threshing
---
It is not proper
 work for them; and on all the better class of farms it has been given
 up, as he knows very well. 
---
I will walk with you as far as your
 home.
---
that's tender and strong between man and woman
---
d'Urberville pausing beside her
---
He did not accompany her further, since,
---
even
    when a man speaks a compliment to me
---
, Angel( handsome is
    the word they use,). 
---
whom he kept

---
he
 had gone
---
" Now," said old Mr Clare to his wife,
---
when he had read the envelope,
"
---
if Angel proposes,
---
as he told us
---
that he hoped
---
, I think;
---
this may hasten his
 plans
---
for I believe." 
---
it to be from his wife
---
He breathed deeply at
 the thought of her; and
---
" Dear fellow, I hope
---
he will get home safely
---
," murmured Mrs Clare.

---
" To my dying day I shall feel. 
---
that he has been
---
You should
 have sent him to Cambridge in spite of his want of faith and. 
---
as the other boys had
---
He would have grown out
 of it under proper influence, and
---
Church or no Church, it would have been fairer to him."


---
This was the only wail with which Mrs Clare ever disturbed her
 husband's peace in respect to their sons. 
---
that
 his mind too was troubled by doubts as to his justice in this matter
---
him lying awake at night,
---
that he would have been justified in giving his son,
 an unbeliever, the same academic advantages that he had given to the
 two others, when it was possible, if not probable,
---
which he had

---
with the other to exalt
 the unfaithful by the same artificial means, he deemed.

---
Nevertheless, he loved his misnamed Angel, and
---
in secret mourned
 over this treatment of him as Abraham might have mourned over the
 doomed Isaac while they went up the hill together. 
---
His silent
 self- generated regrets were far bitterer than the reproaches which
 his wife rendered audible.


---
If Angel had never
 been destined for a farmer he would never have been thrown with
 agricultural girls. 
---
what had separated
 him and his wife
---
But in his later letters he occasionally
 alluded to the intention of coming home to fetch her; from which
 expressions they hoped the division might not owe its origin to
 anything so hopelessly permanent as that. 
---
He had told them.


---
The eyes were gazing at this
 time on a limitless expanse of country from the back of a mule which
 was bearing him from the interior of the South- American Continent
 towards the coast. 
---
His experiences of this strange land had been
 sad. 
---
from which he had suffered shortly after

---
The severe illness his arrival had never wholly left him, and
---
he had by degrees almost

---
as
 the bare possibility existed of his remaining
---
decided to relinquish his hope of farming here, though, as long, he kept this change
 of view a secret from his parents.


---
who had come out to the country
 in his wake,
---
He would see mothers from English
 farms trudging along with their infants in their arms,
---
Angel's original intention had not been emigration to Brazil but a
 northern or eastern farm in his own country. 
---
He had come to this
 place in a fit of desperation,
---
the Brazil movement among the English
 agriculturists having by chance coincided with his desire to escape
 from his past existence.


---
he had
---
What arrested him now as of value in life
---
Having long discredited the old systems of mysticism,
 he now began. 
---
He
 thought. 
---
Who was the moral man? 
---
for his hasty judgement began

---
Did he reject her eternally, or
---
did he not? 
---
He
 could no longer say.


---
that he would always reject her, and
---
He was greatly perplexed; and
---
in his perplexity as
 to her motives in withholding intelligence, he did not inquire. 
---
if he had
---
In the before- mentioned journey by mules through the interior of the
 country, another man rode beside him.
---
Angel's companion was also an
 Englishman, bent on the same errand,. 
---
though he came from another part
 of the island
---
evinced by men
---
, Angel admitted to this man
.


---
as they rode along the sorrowful facts of his marriage
---
The stranger had sojourned in many more lands and among many more
 peoples than Angel; to his cosmopolitan mind such deviations from the
 social norm, so immense to domesticity
---
He viewed the matter in quite a different light from Angel
---
that he was wrong in coming away
 from her
---
Angel's companion
 was struck down with fever, and. 
---
Clare waited
 a few hours to bury him, and
---
of whom he knew

---
The cursory remarks of the large- minded stranger, absolutely nothing beyond a commonplace name, were sublimed by his
 death, and. 
---
His own parochialism made him ashamed by its contrast.

---
His inconsistencies rushed upon him in a flood. 
---
Surely then he might have regarded that abhorrence of the un- intact
 state, which he had inherited with the creed of mysticism, as at
 least open to correction when the result was due to treachery. 
---
A
 remorse struck into him. 
---
The words of Izz Huett, never quite stilled
 in his memory, came back to him. 
---
He had asked Izz,
 and
---
He thought of Tess.

---
How her eyes had lingered upon him
---
when her simple soul uncovered itself to his
---
And during the terrible evening over the
 hearth,, how pitiful her
 face had looked by the rays of the fire, in her inability to realize
 that his love and protection could possibly be withdrawn.


---
Thus from being her critic he grew. 
---
he had uttered to himself about her
---
no man can be always
 a cynic and live; and
---
he withdrew them. 
---
The mistake of expressing
 them had arisen from his allowing himself to be influenced by general
 principles to the disregard of the particular instance.


---
Clare had been harsh towards her
---
Men are too often harsh with women they
 love or; women with men. 
---
whom he had despised as a spent force
---
The historic interest of her family-- that masterful line of
 d'Urbervilles--, touched his
 sentiments now. 
---
Why had he not known the difference between the
 political value and the imaginative value of these things? 
---
So
 does Time ruthlessly destroy his own romances. 
---
In recalling her face
 again and again, he thought now the vision
 sent that_ aura_ through his veins which he had formerly felt, and
 which left behind it a sense of sickness.


---
that he could see therein a flash of
 the dignity which must have graced her grand- dames; and
---
which was then just being forwarded to him by his father
---
that Angel would come in response
 to the entreaty
---
Sighs were expended on the wish that she
 had taken more notice of the tunes he played on his harp,. 
---
which were his favourite ballads
 among those the country- girls sang
---
that perhaps he would not, after all, come, and

---
as
 father is not very well neither, and
---
says' tis wrong for a man of
 such a high family as his to slave and drave at common labouring
 work, we do n't know
---
when he had not danced
 with her
---
that Mrs Durbeyfield was
---
Her father's ill- health was the same indefinite kind, and
---
he sat in
 his chair as usual. 
---
But the day after her arrival he was unusually
 bright. 
---
He had a rational scheme for living, and
---
," he said,"
---
I'm sure they'd see it as a romantical, artistical,
 and proper thing to do. 
---
they thinking nothing of him! 
---
, he'd ha' done it
---
, I'm sure."


---
in a few
 days her father was well enough to see to the garden, under Tess's
 persuasive efforts:.


---
, some of the gardening men and women gave over
 for the night, but
---
Nobody looked at his or her companions. 
---
her father had sent there
---
when the direction of his digging
 brought him closer
---
did he speak to her.

---
By- and- by
 he dug so close to her that the fire- beams were reflected as
 distinctly from the steel prongs of his fork as from her own. 
---
that he did the same on the other side
---
The unexpectedness of his presence, the grotesqueness of his
 appearance in a gathered smockfrock, such as, had a ghastly comicality that
 chilled her as to its bearing. 
---
D'Urberville emitted a low, long
 laugh.


---
If I were inclined to joke
---
", I should say,!"
---
he remarked whimsically,.


---
" I never said, or.  I do n't think of you in
 that way at all.  I
 saw as I came along that I
 might n't be noticed I come." But I like doing it-- it is for my father."


---
he cried lightly. 
---
" About the children-- your brothers and sisters," he resumed.
---
-- he was touching her in a weak place. 
---
He had

---
since your father will not be able to do much
---
" He can
---
He must!"


---
" Why, he
 thinks; and!"


---
" He do n't. 
---
D'Urberville in anger retreated from her to the hedge, where he
 pulled off the long smockfrock which had disguised him; and
---
if he had gone back to her father's house; and
---
father is dead
---
The child realized the grandeur of the news; but not as yet its
 sadness, and stood looking at Tess with round- eyed importance till,
 beholding the effect produced upon her, she said--

" What, Tess, sha n't we talk to father never no more?"


---
" But father was only a little bit ill!"
---
" He dropped down just now, and
---
there was no chance for him
---
because his heart was growed in
---
Her father's life had a value apart from his
 personal achievements, or
---
it had long been coveted by the
 tenant- farmer for his regular labourers, who were stinted in cottage
 accommodation. 
---
The village had formerly contained,
 side by side with the argicultural labourers, an interesting and
 better- informed class,-- the class
 to which Tess's father and mother had belonged-- and including the
 carpenter, the smith, the shoemaker, the huckster, together with
 nondescript workers other than farm- labourers; a set of people
 who owed a certain stability of aim and conduct to the fact of
 their being lifeholders like Tess's father, or copyholders, or
 occasionally, small freeholders. 
---
if not absolutely required by the farmer for his hands
---
every house standing was required by the agriculturist for his work- people. 
---
The father, and even the mother,
 had got drunk at times
---
they would spend in the village which had been their home and
 birthplace, Mrs Durbeyfield,' Liza- Lu, and
---
that he saw her so quickly, and
---
that his hoofs were almost upon the narrow border for
 plants growing under the wall
---
till he touched the window
 with his riding- crop
---
If you are a genuine d'Urberville
---
in which he was

---
in the struggle he killed her-- or
---
One of the family is said to have abducted some
 beautiful woman, who tried to escape from the coach in which he was
 carrying her off, and in the struggle he killed her-- or she killed
 him-- I forget which.  I see.  Going away, are n't you?"


---
" I heard, but" Father's was the last life on the property, and
---
D'Urberville's face flushed.


---
" I am not a-- proper woman."

" he exclaimed in tones of ironic resentment.

---
what men are
---
he will never make it up with
 you
---
But d'Urberville persisted
---
; he would not take a negative.


---
" How do I know I would guarantee you against such as that in writing, if
 necessary. ," he said,
---
I shall get, and
---
Now mind, I shall
 expect you."


---
I owe you something for the past
---
.

",," he resumed. 
---
so I am
---
" I would rather you had kept the craze,!"


---
" I am glad of this opportunity of repaying you a little. 
---
I
 shall expect... 
---
With the last sentence he had dropped his voice to a murmur, and. 
---
he said,.

---
Well I shall expect
 you, or your mother and children at least."


---
I shall not come
---
"-- I have plenty of money!
---
if I ask for it
---
, Tess; I know you
---
he rode off
---
he
 met the man with the paint- pot, who asked him if he had deserted the
 brethren.


---
Her husband, Angel Clare himself, had,

---
like others, dealt out hard measure to her; surely he had! 
---
he had surely! 
---
I do
   . 
---
I have thought it all over carefully,
    and
---
I can never, never forgive you! 
---
that I
    did not intend
---
I will try. 
---
till the postman, ran out to him with
 her epistle, and
---
How
 could he give way to entreaty? 
---
: there was
 no new event to alter his opinion.


---
Mrs Durbeyfield's pattens clicked up to the
 door, and
---
He did n't call
---
" He spoke to me in passing."


---
.  He'll never, never come
---
You've seen him before, and
---
What did he say?
---
It was not her husband
---
that in a
 physical sense this man alone was her husband
---
; for it was always by the vehicle of the farmer who required
 his services that the hired man was conveyed to his destination.

---
But to Tess and her mother's household no such anxious farmer sent
 his team. 
---
in which
 Joan Durbeyfield and the young children were
---
if he chose
---
" He found me."


---
who I mean" Ah-- but I did see him!"" And do he know?
---
" I think so."

" Husband come back?
---
of whom her father had spoken and
---
A man could be seen, and

---
when he beheld the nature of their waggon- load
---
he quickened his
 steps.


---
You be the woman they call Mrs Durbeyfield
---
" You be the woman they call Mrs Durbeyfield, I reckon?" he said to
 Tess's mother, who had descended to walk the remainder of the way.


---
if I cared for my rights; and
---
Well, I know nothing about that; but
---
if you be Mrs Durbeyfield
---
,
 I am sent. 
---
The man had noticed the face of Tess, which had become ash- pale at
 his intelligence. 
---
he was bound.


---
he moved off and. 
---
he guessed.


---
It was called
 the d'Urberville Window, and in the upper part could be discerned
 heraldic emblems like those on Durbeyfield's old seal and spoon.


---
As soon they beheld a man on horseback.

---
he said,. 
---
It was Alec d'Urberville. 
---
" he asked.


---
d'Urberville saying
---
that he
 would see them again,
---
in case they should be still unsuccessful in
 their search for shelter, of which he had just heard
---
gone, d'Urberville rode to the inn, and.


---
He leapt off the slab and.


---
I saw
---
"," he said," and. 
---
He stamped with his heel heavily on the floor;.


---
, I'll warrant!
---
" he continued. 
---
I was the mere stone reproduction of one of them
---
What shall I do?"


---
" I will-- I'll look for your mother
---
," said he blandly. 
---
But in passing
 her he whispered:"!"


---
When he was gone
---
said--

" Why am I on the wrong side of this door!"



---
Their talk was of Angel Clare and Tess, and Tess's persistent lover,
 whose connection with her previous history they had partly heard and
 partly guessed ere this.

"' Tisn't as though she had never known him afore
---
if he were
---
Mr Clare can
 never be anything to us, Izz; and
---
why should we grudge him to her,
 and? 
---
If he could on'y know what straits

---
, he might come.
---
him know
---
Upon that, agitated anew by their attachment to him, yet
 honourably disposed to her, Marian uncorked the penny ink- bottle they
 shared, and a few lines were concocted between the two girls.


   
---
This was addressed to Angel Clare at the only place they had ever
 heard him to be connected with, Emminster Vicarage;.



---
he had not
 been sitting there. 
---
Occasionally he came in,.


---
Mrs Clare,, followed him hither.


---
" He does n't reach Chalk- Newton
 till six,, and ten miles of
 country- road, five of them in Crimmercrock Lane,."


---
" But he has done it in an hour with us, my dear."


---
had he not got out
 of their carriage at the particular moment
---
Mrs Clare rushed through the dark passage to the door, and
---
her
 husband came more slowly after her.


---
they could only see his
 shape against the light.


---
cried Mrs Clare, who cared
 no more at that moment for the stains of heterodoxy which had caused
 all this separation than for the dust upon his clothes. 
---
as they reached the room
 where the candles were lighted she looked at his face
---
" O, it is not Angel-- not my son-- the Angel who went away!"
---
that Clare had
 experienced, in the climate to which he had so rashly hurried in his
 first aversion to the mockery of events at home
---
You could see the
 skeleton behind the man, and almost the ghost behind the skeleton.

---
He matched
---
Christus_.  His sunken eye- pits were of
 morbid hue, and
---
the light in his eyes had waned. 
---
lines of his aged ancestors had succeeded to their reign in his
 face twenty years before their time.


---
" I was ill over there," he said. 
---
" I am all right now."


---
As if, however, to falsify this assertion, his legs seemed, and
---
he suddenly sat down. 
---
he asked. 
---
" I received the
 last you sent on by the merest chance, and after considerable delay
 through being inland; or
---
I might have come sooner."


---
They had not sent it on to him,
.


---
he would start for home so soon
---
He hastily opened the letter produced, and.


   
---
the sentiments expressed in her last hurried
 scrawl to him
---
I do
   . 
---
I have thought it all over carefully,
    and
---
I can never, never forgive you! 
---
that I
    did not intend
---
I will try. 
---
said Angel,. 
---
that her father is a descendant in the
 male line of one of the oldest Norman houses, like a good many others
 who lead obscure agricultural lives in our villages, and are dubbed
' sons of the soil
---
He soon retired to bed; and
---
, he remained in his room pondering. 
---
which he had left Tess
---
that her estimate of him had changed under his delay-- too

---
, he sadly owned,--
---
him ask himself
---
Clare therefore thought, and his
 hope that she was still living with them there, as he had arranged
 for her to do when he left England. 
---
He despatched the inquiry that
 very day, and
---
before the week was out there came a short reply from
 Mrs Durbeyfield which did not remove his embarrassment, for it bore
 no address, though to his surprise it was not written from Marlott.


   
---
It was such a relief to Clare. 
---
They were all angry with him,
 evidently. 
---
He would wait. 
---
till Mrs Durbeyfield could inform him of
 Tess's return, which her letter implied to be soon
---
He deserved no
 more. 
---
His had been a love".

---
He had undergone some strange experiences in his absence
---
; he had seen
 the virtual Faustina in the literal Cornelia, a spiritual Lucretia in
 a corporeal Phryne
---
; he had thought of the woman taken and set in the
 midst as one deserving to be stoned, and
---
he had asked himself?


---
why he had not judged Tess
 constructively rather than biographically, by the will rather than
 by the deed
---
while he waited at his father's house for the

---
Then he hunted up the
 old letter sent on to him in Brazil, which Tess had written from
 Flintcomb- Ash, and re- read it. 
---
The sentences touched him now.


   ...
---
as
 much as when he had first perused them
---
I must cry to you in my trouble
---
-- I have no one
    else!... 
---
I think...
---
I must die, or
---
, I could die in your arms! 
---
I would
    be well content to do that if so be you had forgiven
    me!...
---
I am coming soon,
---
say,
   "" I will bide on, Angel-- O, so
    cheerfully!...
---
if I could only make your
    dear heart ache one little minute of each day
---
I would be
    content, ay, glad,,
   
---
if I may not as your wife
---
to live with you as your servant; so that I could only be
    near you, and.... 
---
Clare determined, but. 
---
that he would no longer believe in her more recent
 and severer regard of him
---
He
 asked his father.

---
His father returned a negative, and
---
then for the first time it
 occurred to Angel. 
---
From his remarks his parents now gathered
 the real reason of the separation; and
---
Whilst he was hastily packing together a few articles for his journey

---
he glanced over a poor plain missive the
 one from Marian and Izz Huett, beginning--

"
---
In a quarter of an hour Clare was leaving the house, whence
---
He had declined. 
---
He went to the inn, where he hired
 a trap, and. 
---
In a very few
 minutes after, he was driving up the hill out of the town which,
 three or four months earlier in the year, Tess had descended with
 such hopes and.


---
Benvill Lane soon stretched before him, its hedges and trees purple
 with buds; but
---
he was looking at other things, and. 
---
In
 something less than an hour- and- a- half he had skirted the south of
 the King's Hintock estates and. 
---
Thence he went along the verge of the upland overhanging the other
 Hintocks, and,. 
---
he supposed
---
Here, of course, he
 did not find her; and
---
what added to his depression
---
that no" Mrs Clare" had ever been heard of by the cottagers or by
 the farmer himself
---
was
 shown not much less by this abstention than by the hardships she had
 chosen to undergo( of which he now learnt for the first time).


---
From this place they told him
---
Tess Durbeyfield had gone, without due
 notice, to the home of her parents on the other side of Blackmoor,
 and
---
it therefore became necessary to find Mrs Durbeyfield. 
---
he had arrived in being sent back
 to Emminster
---
Clare would not accept the loan of the farmer's vehicle for a further
 distance than to the outskirts of the Vale, and,
---
who had driven him
---
sending it back with
 the man, he put up at an inn, and
---
wherein was the spot of his dear Tess's birth
---
it was of a parcel with his
 expectations.


---
On inquiry of these precious innocents,, Clare learned. 
---
that John
 Durbeyfield was dead;
---
that his widow and children had left Marlott,
 but instead of

---
By this time
 Clare abhorred the house for ceasing to contain Tess, and.


---
His way was by the field. 
---
in which he had
---
He passed on through
 the churchyard, where, amongst the new headstones, he saw one of a
 somewhat superior design to the rest. 
---
The inscription ran thus:


   In memory of John Durbeyfield, rightly d'Urberville, of
   the once powerful family of that Name, and Direct
   Descendant through an illustrious Line from Sir Pagan
   d'Urberville, one of the Knights of the Conqueror. 
---
Some man, apparently the sexton, had observed. 
---
Clare standing there,
 and
---
" Ah, sir, now that's a man who did n't want to lie
 here, but."


---
where his ancestors be
---
" And why did n't they respect his wish?"


---
, why-- there, I would n't wish to

---
The man told the name of a mason in the village, and,. 
---
on leaving the
 churchyard, Clare called at the mason's house
---
He found and. 
---
, he turned in the
 direction of the migrants.


---
Clare felt such a strong
 desire for isolation that at first he would neither hire a conveyance
 nor go to a circuitous line of railway by which he might eventually
 reach the place. 
---
At Shaston, however, he found; but

---
he must hire
---
that he did not enter Joan's place till about seven
 o'clock in the evening,
---
The village being small he had little difficulty in finding Mrs
 Durbeyfield's tenement, which was a house in a walled garden,
 remote from the main road, where she had stowed away her clumsy old
 furniture as best she could. 
---
him to visit her
---
he felt. 
---
his call to
 be somewhat of an intrusion
---
he was too
 preoccupied to observe more than that. 
---
He was obliged, and
---
that
 he was Tess's husband, and his object in coming there
---
he did it
 awkwardly enough. 
---
" I want
---
to see her at once," he added. 
---
But you ought to, sir
---
this time crept to the door, where, pulling at his mother's skirts,
 the youngest murmured--

" Is this the gentleman who is going to marry Tess?"


---
He has married her
---
Clare saw her efforts for reticence, and
---
He was turning away; and
---
then he thought of Tess's tender letter.


---
he retorted passionately. 
---
that he suffered
---
he pressed her
 no further.


---
he said gently.


---
Without entering the house Clare turned away. 
---
, he walked thither.

---
it bore Clare
 on its wheels.




---
At eleven o'clock that night, having secured a bed at one of the
 hotels and telegraphed his address to his father immediately on his
 arrival, he walked out into the streets of Sandbourne. 
---
he reluctantly postponed
 his purpose till the morning. 
---
But he could not retire yet.


---
This fashionable watering- place, with its eastern and its western
 stations, its piers, its groves of pines, its promenades, and its
 covered gardens, was, to Angel Clare, like a fairy place suddenly
 created by the stroke of a wand, and.

---
By the midnight lamps he went up and down the winding way of this new
 world in an old one, and.
---
he
 thought
---
he thought.


---
The more he pondered
---
, the more was he
. 
---
he sauntered along,.


---
just after twelve o'clock he entered
 and
---
he re
---
Sleep, however, he could not-- so near her, yet
 so far from her-- and
---
he continually lifted
---
He might almost as well have sat up all night. 
---
In the morning he
 arose at seven, and. 
---
At the door he met an intelligent postman
 coming out with letters for the morning delivery.


---
" Do you know the address of a Mrs Clare?
---
The postman
 shook his head.


---
"," he
 said;" and without the name of the house' tis impossible to find
' em."


---
One of his comrades hastening out at that moment, the name was
 repeated to him.


---
I know no name of Durbeyfield; but
---
there is the name of d'Urberville
 at The Herons
---
cried Clare,. 
---
Clare received directions how to find the house, and. 
---
as he feared
---
he was thither also. 
---
However, in his doubts he turned to the front, and

---
Clare
 inquired for Teresa d'Urberville or Durbeyfield.


---
he felt glad,.


---
He was shown into the front room-- the dining- room-- and. 
---
it crossed his mind. 
---
He did not blame her
 for one moment. 
---
at which his heart thumped so painfully that he could hardly
 stand firm
---
he said to himself; and
---
He had held out his arms, but
---
they had fallen again to his side;
. 
---
that he was now
---
, he felt the contrast
 between them, and.


---
he said huskily,"? 
---
he
 continued. 
---
He kept on, and
---
He was very kind to me,
 and to mother, and to all of us after father's death.
---
" He has won me back to him."


---
Clare looked at her keenly, then,
---
his glance sank
---
" He is upstairs. 
---
because he told me a lie--
---
he's

---
what he did wi' me
---
said Clare.


---
But he could not get on. 
---
But
 he had a vague consciousness of one thing,
---
though it was not clear
 to him till later
---
he found. 
---
His face
 grew colder and more shrunken as he stood concentrated on the moment,
 and
---
a minute or two after, he found himself in the street,.




---
along he did not know whither
---
then my dear, dear husband came home to me... and
---
I did not
 know it!... 
---
my husband would never come back--
---
And then he came back!

---
Now he is gone. 
---
he will not love me the littlest bit ever any
 more--!...
---
And he is dying
---
-- he looks!
---
as if he
 is dying
---
And my sin will kill him and!... 
---
My own true husband will never,

---
There were more and sharper words from the man
---
Mr d'Urberville might still be asleep,.


---
for he was not
 an early riser
---
did the gentleman ring his bell. 
---
A man one of the workmen employed at an
 adjoining villa, was passing by, and
---
He opened the doors,. 
---
he has been hurt with a knife--
---
the point of the blade had touched
 the heart of the victim, who lay on his back, pale, fixed, dead, as
 if he had scarcely moved after the infliction of the blow. 
---
that a gentleman had been stabbed in his bed
---
Meanwhile Angel Clare had walked automatically along the way by which
 he had come, and,. 
---
He went on eating and drinking unconsciously
 till.


---
on a sudden he demanded his bill;
---
having paid which, he took his
 dressing- bag in his hand, the only luggage he had brought with him,
 and
---
At the moment of his departure a telegram was handed to him-- a few
 words from his mother, stating that they were glad to know his
 address, and informing him that his brother Cuthbert had proposed to
 and been accepted by Mercy Chant
---
.

 Clare crumpled up the paper and
---
followed the route to the station;
 reaching it, he found. 
---
He sat down, and. 
---
that he could wait there no longer
---
Broken in heart and
 numbed, he had nothing to hurry for; but
---
he wished, and.


---
the train pick him up
 there
---
that he followed
---
He had traversed the greater part of this depression, and

---
when, pausing for breath, he
 unconsciously looked back
---
Why he did so
---
he could not say, but

---
as he could see
---
as he
 gazed a moving spot intruded on the white vacuity of its perspective.


---
Clare waited, with a dim sense that
 somebody was trying to overtake him.


---
his mind blinded to the idea of his wife's following him
---
he did not recognize her under the totally
 changed attire in which he now beheld her
---
that he
 did not ask her a single question, but
---
so quivering in every muscle, seizing her hand, and pulling
 it within his arm, he led her along. 
---
he left the high road and
---
When they were deep among the moaning boughs he stopped
 and.


---
I was! And
 at last I believed you and!...  I have lost him now
 for ever... and O yes, I have lost him now-- again because
 of-- you!"  what I prayed you in
 never-- O God-- I ca n't bear" What!" said he,.


---
I have done it
---
"-- I do n't know how
---
" Still, I owed it
 to you, and to myself, Angel. 
---
I feared long ago,
---
when I struck him
 on the mouth with my glove
---
, that I might do it some day for the trap
 he set for me in my simple youth, and his wrong to you through me.

---
He has come between us and, and
---
now he can never do it any
 more. 
---
I never loved him at all, Angel,. 
---
as I loved you
---
I was

---
when I
 loved you so
---
I ca n't think. 
---
But I do n't blame you;

---
, now I have
 killed him? 
---
I thought
---
as I ran along
---
I have done that. 
---
that I should get you back that way
---
I could not bear the loss of
 you any longer
---
how entirely I was unable to bear your

---
you do now, dear, dear husband
---
, now I
 have killed him
---
I do love you, Tess--
---
I do
---
he said,
. 
---
" But how-- you have killed him?"


---
I mean
---
that I have
---
Is he dead?"


---
He heard, and
---
he bitterly taunted me; and
; and
---
then I did it. 
---
He had nagged me about you before. 
---
And then I dressed
 myself and."


---
By degrees he was. 
---
his horror at her impulse
 was mixed with amazement at the strength of her affection for
 himself, and at the strangeness of its quality, which had apparently
 extinguished her moral sense altogether
---
he looked
 at her,. 
---
There momentarily flashed
 through his mind. 
---
As well as his confused and excited ideas could
 reason, he supposed.


---
that he would be anything
 to her but a protector
---
He saw. 
---
for him to be otherwise
---
Tenderness was
 absolutely dominant in Clare at last. 
---
He kissed her endlessly with
 his white lips, and! 
---
as he had become
---
To her he was, as of old, all that was perfection, personally and
 mentally. 
---
He was still her Antinous, her Apollo even
---
; his sickly
 face was beautiful as the morning to her affectionate regard on
 this day no less than when she first beheld him;
---
for was it not the
 face of the one man on earth who had loved her purely, and
---
as he had
 intended
---
he persuaded
 her. 
---
till he should come back
---
He soon returned, with food
 enough for half- a- dozen people and two bottles of wine-- enough to
 last them for a day or more
---
as well steer in a general way towards the interior
 of the country, are less likely to
 be looked for than anywhere near the coast," Clare remarked. 
---
"," said Clare. 
---
he said. 
---
And
 kissing her sad mouth, he again led her onwards.


---
He was growing weary likewise,
---
He thought.


---
," he said.

---
He then requested her.


---
whilst he went
---
Clare crept
 towards the house. 
---
His absence lasted some considerable time, and

---
when he returned
---
He had found out from a boy, and
---
rest there," said he.


---
Clare clambered in, and.


---
Clare unlatched the door of a large chamber,.

---
" Rest at last!" said he,.


---
Then Clare again stole a chink of light from
 the window, and
---
He had never known of that till now.


---
he said. 
---
Clare, rightly informed. 
---
he took advantage of the fog. 
---
His re- entry awoke her; and

---
they breakfasted on what he had brought.


---
Whenever he suggested
---
He peeped out also. 
---
why any man should, sooner or later, be able to help despising
 me
---
Tess's lips being parted like a half- opened flower
 near his cheek
---
as he was dressed he narrowly

---
"," said he. 
---
And I
 can not help. 
---
He decided. 
---
when
 on a sudden Clare became conscious of some vast erection close in
 his front, rising sheer from the grass
---
said Angel.


---
He listened. 
---
lifting his hand and advancing a step or
 two, Clare felt the vertical surface of the structure. 
---
Carrying his fingers
 onward he found
---
what he had come in contact with
---
by stretching out his left hand he could feel a
 similar one adjoining. 
---
" A very Temple of the Winds," he said.


---
said Clare.


---
" I do n't want, Angel,
---
He knelt down beside her outstretched form, and.


---
he flung his overcoat upon her, and.


---
" Angel,, will you watch over' Liza- Lu for
 my sake?
---
he fell into thought. 
---
In the far north- east sky he
 could see between the pillars a level streak of light. 
---
Well, I have said it.  I wo n't mention
 it again."

" No," said he.


---
" I believe to the sun. 
---
He kissed her.


---
he did not answer
---
, her clasp of his hand relaxed,

---
It was the head of a man approaching them
 from the hollow beyond the Sun- stone. 
---
Clare wished, but
---
He heard something behind him, the brush of feet. 
---
Turning, he saw
 over the prostrate columns another figure
---
; then before he was aware
---
Clare could discern from this. 
---
that he was tall, and
---
Springing to his feet, he looked around for a weapon,
 loose stone,. 
---
By this time the nearest
 man was upon him.


---
"," he said. 
---
he implored in a whisper of the men.


---
He went to the stone and bent over her, holding one poor
 little hand
---
" Yes, dearest," he said. 
---
" Angel, I am almost glad-- yes,
 glad! 
---
I
 have had enough; and
---
now I shall not live!"


---
neither of the men
 having moved
---
I am ready
---
One of the pair was Angel Clare, the other a tall budding
 creature-- half girl, half woman-- a spiritualized image of Tess,
 slighter than she, but with the same beautiful eyes-- Clare's
 sister- in- law,' Liza- Lu. 
---
where to this day the pilgrim may receive his dole of bread and ale
---
the President of the Immortals, in Aeschylean
 phrase, had ended his sport with Tess.
