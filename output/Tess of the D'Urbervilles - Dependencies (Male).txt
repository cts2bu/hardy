I


 On an evening in the latter part of May a middle- aged man was walking
 homeward from Shaston to the village of Marlott, in the adjoining
 Vale of Blakemore, or Blackmoor. 
---
that carried him

---
there was a bias in his gait which inclined him
 somewhat to the left of a straight line. 
---
He occasionally gave a
 smart nod, as if in confirmation of some opinion, though he was not
 thinking of anything in particular. 
---
An empty egg- basket was slung
 upon his arm
---
, the nap of his hat was ruffled,.

---
where his thumb came in taking it off
---
Presently he was met by an elderly parson astride on a gray mare,
.


---
as he rode
---
" Good night t'ee," said the man with the basket.


---
" Good night, Sir John," said the parson.


---
" Then what might your meaning be in calling me' Sir John' these
 different times, when I be plain Jack Durbeyfield, the haggler?"


---
"," he said;
---
that you are the lineal representative of the ancient
 and knightly family of the d'Urbervilles, who derive their descent
 from Sir Pagan d'Urberville, that renowned knight who came from
 Normandy with William the Conqueror,
---
Your ancestor was one of the twelve
 knights who assisted the Lord of Estremavilla in Normandy in his
 conquest of Glamorganshire. 
---
In the reign of King John one of them was rich
 enough to give a manor to the Knights Hospitallers; and
---
in Charles the
 Second's reign you were made Knights of the Royal Oak for your
 loyalty. 
---
when men were knighted from father
 to son
---
, you would be Sir John now."


---
" Daze my eyes, and is n't there?" said Durbeyfield. 
---
as he was aware
---
His own investigations had begun on a day in the preceding spring

---
when, having been engaged in tracing the vicissitudes of the
 d'Urberville family, he had observed Durbeyfield's name on his
 waggon, and.


---
till he had no doubt on the subject
---
" not to disturb you with such a useless piece of
 information," said he. 
---
where he came from
---
Concluding thus, the parson rode on his way, with doubts
 as to his discretion in retailing this curious bit of lore.


---
When he was gone
---
, Durbeyfield walked a few steps in a profound
 reverie, and. 
---
which had been
 pursued by Durbeyfield
---
the lad quickened his pace and.


---
" Who be you, then, John
 Durbeyfield, to order me about and'? 
---
as he made the announcement, Durbeyfield,
---
The lad stood before Durbeyfield, and.


---
"," continued the prostrate
 man. 
---
There's not a man in the county
---
o' South- Wessex got grander and nobler skillentons in his family than I."

" Oh?"


---
, Durbeyfield put his hand in
 his pocket, and.


---
that
 he possessed
---
This made a difference in the young man's estimate of the position.


---
The boy took up the basket, and
---
as he set out
---
" said Durbeyfield. 
---
Durbeyfield lay. 
---
The
 traveller from the coast, is surprised and delighted
 to behold, extended like a map beneath him, a country differing
 absolutely from that which he has passed through. 
---
Behind him the
 hills are open
---
In men's clubs such celebrations were,
; but
---
if there is n't thy father

---
round Durbeyfield was seen
,. 
---
with his eyes closed luxuriously
---
He's tired
---
he has got a lift
 home,."


---
" He's got his
 market- nitch. 
---
if you say any jokes
 about him
---
what her father's meaning
 was
---
if he had any
---
Tess Durbeyfield at this time of her life was a mere vessel of
 emotion untinctured by experience. 
---
As there were no men in
 the company
---
Among these on- lookers were three young men of a superior class,
 carrying small knapsacks strapped to their shoulders, and stout
 sticks in their hands. 
---
; the appearance of the third and
 youngest would hardly have been sufficient to characterize him
---
; there
 was an uncribbed, uncabined aspect in his eyes and attire,. 
---
he had hardly as
---
That he was a desultory tentative student of something and

---
everything might only have been predicted of him.


---
He
 unstrapped his knapsack,.


---
The two elder reluctantly left him and
---
," he said gallantly, to two or three of
 the girls nearest him, as soon as there was a pause in the dance.

---
The young man, thus invited, but,
---
as the group were all so new to him
---
, he could
 not very well exercise it. 
---
He took almost the first that came to
 hand,; nor. 
---
the village young men, to enter
 the gate while no intruder was in the way
---
that he must
 leave
---
-- he had been forgetting himself
---
-- he had.

---
As he fell out of the dance
---
his eyes lighted on Tess Durbeyfield
---
that he had not chosen her
---
He, too, was sorry.


---
then that,
 owing to her backwardness, he had not observed her; and
---
with that in
 his mind he left the pasture
---
On account of his long delay he started in and.

---
He had not yet overtaken his brothers, but
---
he paused. 
---
He could see the white figures of the girls in the
 green enclosure. 
---
when he was among
 them
---
From her position he knew. 
---
, he
 yet instinctively felt. 
---
He wished

---
that he had asked her
---
; he wished. 
---
that he had inquired her name
---
that he felt
---
he had acted stupidly
---
, he dismissed the subject from his mind.




---
as the strange young man had done
---
the incident of her father's
 odd appearance and manner returned upon the girl's mind, and
---
what had become of him
---
As usual, Mrs Durbeyfield was balanced on one foot beside the tub,

---
as Mrs Durbeyfield, excited by her
 song
---
Mrs Durbeyfield regarding her daughter the while
---
Even now,
 when burdened with a young family, Joan Durbeyfield was a passionate
 lover of tune. 
---
( Mrs Durbeyfield
 habitually spoke the dialect
---
father's making such a mommet of himself
 in thik carriage this afternoon
---
In Saint Charles's days we was made Knights o' the
 Royal Oak, our real name being d'Urberville!... 
---
that your father rode home
 in the vlee
---
because he'd been drinking,
---
Your father learnt it on his way hwome
 from Shaston, and
---
he has been telling me the whole pedigree of the
 matter."


---
Where is father now
---
:" He called
. 
---
It is fat round his heart,'
---
"' At the present moment,' he says to your
 father,'
---
As soon, so,'"--Mrs Durbeyfield closed her fingers into a circle
 complete--"'off'
---
Her father possibly to go behind the eternal
 cloud so soon, notwithstanding this sudden greatness!

"
---
-- he felt. 
---
-- that he went up to Rolliver's half an hour ago
---
He do
 want. 
---
He'll have."


---
Mrs Durbeyfield's jacket and bonnet were already hanging
 slily upon a chair by her side, in readiness for this contemplated
 jaunt, the reason for which the matron deplored more than its
 necessity.


---
to hunt up her shiftless husband at the inn was one of
 Mrs Durbeyfield's still extant enjoyments in the muck and muddle of
 rearing children. 
---
whence the poet whose philosophy is in these days deemed as profound
 and trustworthy as his song is breezy and pure
---
neither father nor mother reappeared. 
---
that a man in indifferent health, to start on a
 journey before one in the morning, ought
---
what has
 gone wi' father and mother
---
The boy jumped promptly from his seat, and
---
the
 night swallowed him up. 
---
; neither man,
 woman, nor child returned. 
---
Abraham, like his parents, seemed.


---
gathered round three of its sides;
 a couple more men had elevated themselves on a chest of drawers
---
Mrs Durbeyfield, having quickly walked hitherward after parting from
 Tess,
---
Mrs Durbeyfield was welcomed with glances and nods by the remainder
 of the conclave, and. 
---
where her husband sat
---
He was humming
 absently to himself, in a low tone:"! 
---
I've got a great family vault at Kingsbere- sub- Greenhill,
 and finer skillentons than any man in Wessex!"


---
while he, looking through her as through a
 window- pane
---
" He's told'
---
," said Joan Durbeyfield sagely. 
---
that there's a great
 rich lady out by Trantridge, on the edge o' The Chase, of the name of
 d'Urberville
---
said Sir John.


---
"," said Durbeyfield.

---
","
 continued Mrs Durbeyfield;" and
---
father and mother be ready!
---
" But Joan Durbeyfield must mind." 
---
her father
 and mother rise from their seats
---
He had, in truth, drunk very little-- not a
 fourth of the quantity which a systematic tippler could carry to
 church on a Sunday afternoon without a hitch in his eastings or
 genuflections; but
---
the weakness of Sir John's constitution made
 mountains of his petty sins in this kind. 
---
On reaching the fresh
 air he was sufficiently unsteady to incline the row of three at one
 moment as if they were marching to London, and at another and, like most comical
 effects, not quite so comic after all. 
---
they
 could from Durbeyfield, their cause, and from Abraham, and from
 themselves;
---
father wo n't be able to take the journey with the beehives to- morrow
 so early
---
," said Durbeyfield.



---
The poor man ca n't go
---
Mrs Durbeyfield looked unequal to the emergency. 
---
as if he could not believe
---
that at
 that hour, to be in shelter and
 at rest, he was called upon
---
for he had moved in a
 sort of trance so far
---
Abraham, as he more fully awoke(), began; of this tree that looked
 like a raging tiger springing from a lair; of that which resembled a
 giant's head.


---
" he said in a preparatory tone, after a silence.


---
His sister became abruptly still, and. 
---
so that his sister's abstraction was of no
 account
---
He leant back against the hives, and
---
He asked how far away. 
---
But ever and anon
 his childish prattle recurred to what impressed his imagination
 even more deeply than the wonders of creation. 
---
Well, father would n't have coughed and,
 and"


---
as he does
---
Left to his reflections Abraham soon grew drowsy. 
---
if he wished
---
The groan had proceeded from her father's poor horse Prince. 
---
from the wound his
 life's blood was spouting in a stream, and.


---
Prince
 also stood firm and motionless as long as he could
---
; till he suddenly
 sank down in a heap.


---
By this time the mail- cart man had joined her, and. 
---
But he was already dead, and,

---
, the mail- cart man
 returned to his own animal,.


---
"," he said. 
---
He mounted and
---
that had animated
 him
---
that the
 driver of the mail- car had been as good as his word
---
A farmer's
 man from near Stourcastle came up,. 
---
He was
 and
---
All was now hoisted into the
 waggon he had formerly hauled, and with his hoofs in the air, and his
 shoes shining in the setting sunlight
---
, he retraced the eight or nine
 miles to Marlott.


---
In the Durbeyfield countenances
. 
---
that the knacker and tanner would give only a
 very few shillings for Prince's carcase because of his decrepitude
---
,
 Durbeyfield rose to the occasion.


---
he stoically," I wo n't sell his old body
---
He've served me well
 in his lifetime, and
---
I wo n't part from him now."


---
He worked harder the next day in digging a grave for Prince in the
 garden than he had worked for months to grow a crop for his family.

---
, Durbeyfield and his wife tied a rope round
 the horse and. 
---
he gone to heaven
---
Then Durbeyfield began, and
---
Durbeyfield was
---
; he had good strength to work at times; but
---
having been unaccustomed to the regular toil of the day- labourer,
 he was not particularly persistent.


---
that there is a very
 rich Mrs d'Urberville living on the outskirts o
---
that this Mrs d'Urberville was a lady of unequalled virtues and
 charity
---
where he
 sat in the background
---
" going and making themselves beholden to
 strange kin," murmured he. 
---
His reasons for staying away were worse to Tess than her own
 objections to going. 
---
in which the vague and mysterious Mrs d'Urberville had her residence
---
Tess Durbeyfield's route on this memorable morning lay amid the
 north- eastern undulations of the Vale in which she had been born, and
 in which her life had unfolded. 
---
: Joan Durbeyfield was simply an additional one, and that not
 the eldest, to her own long family of waiters on Providence.


---
when her father had owned cows
---
ascended on foot
 a hill in the direction of the district known as The Chase, on the
 borders of which,, Mrs d'Urberville's seat,
 The Slopes, would be found. 
---
not planted by the hand of man
---
Simple Tess Durbeyfield stood at gaze, in a half- alarmed attitude,
 on the edge of the gravel sweep. 
---
when he said
---
that John Durbeyfield was
 the only really lineal representative of the old d'Urberville family
 existing in the county, or near it
---
; he might have added,. 
---
what he knew
 very well,
---
then he was himself
---
When old Mr Simon Stoke, latterly deceased, had made his fortune as
 an honest merchant in the North
---
, he decided
; and
---
in doing this he felt the necessity of
 recommencing with a name that would not too readily identify him with
 the smart tradesman of the past, and. 
---
in which he proposed
---
ruined families appertaining to the quarter of England
 to settle, he considered that_
---
d'Urberville_
 looked and. 
---
d'Urberville
 accordingly was annexed to his own name for himself and his heirs
 eternally
---
Yet he was not an extravagant- minded man in this, and
---
It was that of a
 tall young man, smoking.


---
He had an almost swarthy complexion, with full lips,,
. 
---
though his age could not be more than three- or
 four- and- twenty
---
Despite the touches of barbarism in his contours,
 there was a singular force in the gentleman's face, and in his bold
 rolling eye.

"
---
he, coming forward
---
I am
 Mr d'Urberville. 
---
This embodiment of a d'Urberville and a namesake differed even more
 from what Tess had expected.

---
Tess's sense of a certain ludicrousness in her errand was now
 so strong that, notwithstanding her awe of him, and her general
 discomfort at being here, her rosy lips curved towards a smile,
 much to the attraction of the swarthy Alexander.


---
" Our names are worn away to Durbeyfield; but
---
Antiquarians hold and a
 castle over him. 
---
Alec looked at Tess, in a way that made her
 blush a little. "
---
as he spoke
---
responding to further inquiries
 told him
---
before he returns past Trantridge Cross
---
the young
 man was pressing, and
---
He conducted
 her about the lawns, and flower- beds, and conservatories; and thence
 to the fruit- garden and greenhouses, where he asked her if she liked
 strawberries.


---
D'Urberville began
---
as he stooped; and
---
, he stood up and.


---
" Nonsense!" he insisted; and
---
whence he gathered blossoms and
---
no
 more he himself tucked a bud or two into her hat, and
---
At last,
 looking at his watch, he said,"
---
Stoke d'Urberville took her back to the lawn and into the tent,. 
---
where
 he left her,
---
which
 he put before her himself
---
"?" he asked.


---
He watched her pretty and unconscious munching through the skeins of
 smoke that pervaded the tent, and
---
Tess Durbeyfield did not divine,
,. 
---
that caused Alec
 d'Urberville's eyes to rivet themselves upon her
---
" he asked,.

" Tess Durbeyfield, down at Marlott."


---
as he accompanied her along
 the drive
---
" I-- killed him!"
---
, he inclined his face towards her as if-- but
---
, no: he
 thought better of it, and.


---
coveted that day
 by the wrong man, and
---
not by some other man, the right and desired
 one in all respects-- as;
---
, the man to love rarely coincides with
 the hour for loving. 
---
When d'Urberville got back to the tent
---
he sat down astride on a
 chair,. 
---
Then he broke
 into a loud laugh.

"
---
Mrs d'Urberville says--. 
---
" And did he own' ee?"


---
" Well-- he called me Coz."


---
Jacky-- he called her Coz!"
---
" Well, he spoke to his mother, of course, and
---
" Mrs d'Urberville wrote it. 
---
I would rather stay here with father and
---
Mrs d'Urberville's son had called on horseback,. 
---
He had wished
. 
---
, finally, in the name of his mother, to manage the old lady's fowl- farm or not; the lad hitherto superintended
---
" Mr
 d'Urberville says
---
; he knows. 
---
He is very
 much interested in' ee-- truth to tell."


---
" It is very good of him" and
---
He is a mighty handsome man!"


---
I'm sure he wears a
 beautiful diamond ring!"


---
when he put his hand up to his
 mistarshers
---
" Hark at that child!" cried Mrs Durbeyfield, with parenthetic
 admiration.


---
" Perhaps to show his diamond ring," murmured Sir John, dreamily, from
 his chair.


---
" He's
.
---
He called her Coz! 
---
He'll marry
 her, most likely, and; and
---
John Durbeyfield had more conceit than energy or health, and
---
this
 supposition was pleasant to him.


---
what young Mr d'Urberville means
---
," he admitted;
" and. 
---
sure enough he mid have serious thoughts about improving his
 blood by linking on to the old line
---
I had seen Mrs d'Urberville
---
Her father coughed in his chair.


---
Mr
 d'Urberville being there
---
Her
 father alone preserved an attitude of neutrality.


---
Mrs Durbeyfield did not promise. 
---
that Mrs d'Urberville was glad of her decision, and
---
Mrs d'Urberville's handwriting seemed rather
 masculine.


---
that he at least knows the correct time of day,
---
as if equally convinced that he is mistaken
---
Mrs Durbeyfield was only too delighted at this tractability.

---
, Mrs Durbeyfield hung a black
 cloak outside the casement, and. 
---
ee what' tis, Durbeyfield," said she exultingly;" he'll
 never have the heart. 
---
However,, a slight misgiving
 found place in Joan Durbeyfield's mind. 
---
" Going to work, my dears, for our rich relation, and help get enough
 money for a new horse," said Mrs Durbeyfield pacifically.


---
as he suspended his nap
---
my young friend will like such
 a comely sample of his own blood
---
" Not for less than a thousand pound!" cried Lady Durbeyfield.


---
He'll adorn it better than a poor lammicken
 feller like myself can. 
---
Tell'n he shall hae it for a hundred. 
---
tell'n he shall hae it for fifty-- for
 twenty pound
---
" Bide here a bit, and," said Mrs
 Durbeyfield. 
---
The driver was a young man
 of three- or four- and- twenty, with a cigar between his teeth
---
; wearing
 a dandy cap, drab jacket, breeches of the same hue, white neckcloth,
 stick- up collar, and brown driving- gloves-- in short, he was the
 handsome, horsey young buck who had visited Joan a week or two before
 to get her answer about Tess.


---
Mrs Durbeyfield clapped her hands like a child. 
---
The young
 man dismounted, and. 
---
; he
 mounted beside her, and. 
---
There were tears also in Joan Durbeyfield's eyes. 
---
her husband asked.


---
whether the gentleman
 is really a good- hearted young man and choice over her as his
 kinswoman
---
" Yes, you ought, perhaps, to ha' done that," snored Sir John.


---
Joan Durbeyfield always managed:". 
---
if he do n't marry her afore
---
And he
 will
---
For that he's all afire wi' love for her any eye can
 see."


---
, Alec d'Urberville drove rapidly along
 the crest of the first hill,
---
Ever since the accident with her father's horse Tess Durbeyfield,
 courageous, had been exceedingly timid on
 wheels; the least irregularity of motion startled her. 
---
D'Urberville looked round upon her,.

"
---
his lips to smile slowly of
 themselves
---
"

" Ah," he said,.

---
If any living man can manage this horse
---
any living man can do it
---
, I am
 he."


---
his( the latter being the more
 likely)
---
" said d'Urberville.


---
; whether he were man
 or woman, stick or stone, in her involuntary hold on him. 
---
Now then, again!" said d'Urberville.


---
," he retorted.


---
He loosened rein, and
---
D'Urberville
 turned his face to her, and in playful raillery:
"
---
at which he urged the horse anew, and.

"
---
her
 large eyes staring at him like those of a wild animal
---
He drew rein, and
---
he was on the point of imprinting
 the desired salute, when, as if hardly yet aware of her own modesty,
 she dodged aside. 
---
His arms being occupied with the reins there.


---
He was inexorable, and
---
d'Urberville gave her the
 kiss of mastery. 
---
No sooner had he done so. 
---
that had been touched by his lips
---
His ardour was nettled at the
 sight, for the act on her part.


---
" said the young man.


---
he was
---
he resumed,. 
---
his injured tone
 still remaining,
---
as he flourished the whip anew
---
D'Urberville
 pulled up, and.


---
he would get it for her,
---
", upon my soul,," he
 said,. 
---
Her strategic silence confirmed his suspicion.


---
Then d'Urberville cursed and. 
---
he could think of for the trick
---
Turning the horse suddenly he tried
, and. 
---
But he could not do this short of injuring her.


---
"

 D'Urberville's bad temper cleared up at sight of hers; and
---
he laughed
 heartily.


---
"," he said. 
---
From
 time to time d'Urberville exhibited a sort of fierce distress at
 the sight of the tramping. 
---
he had driven her
---
he
 had forfeited her confidence for the time, and
---
turned into a fowl- house by Mrs Stoke- d'Urberville as soon as the
 property fell into hand
---
Mrs d'Urberville wants the fowls as usual
---
said Mrs
 d'Urberville,. 
---
But he is hardly so
 lively to- day,
---
is he? 
---
He is alarmed at being handled by a stranger,

---
At the end of the ceremony Mrs d'Urberville abruptly asked Tess,
?"


---
he has left. 
---
" Mr d'Urberville whistled to'em this morning, ma'am
---
The girl's surprise at
 Mrs d'Urberville's manner was not great; for since seeing the size of
 the house she had expected no more. 
---
Mrs d'Urberville
 was not the first mother.



---
It was Alec
 d'Urberville, whom she had not set eyes on since he had conducted
 her the day before to the door of the gardener's cottage where she
 had lodgings.


---
" Upon my honour!" cried he,. 
---
He suited the action to the word, and." 
---
" Now try," said d'Urberville.


---
But he persisted in his demand, and at last,
---
He encouraged her with" Try again!"


---
never before fell to mortal man, I'll keep my
 word... 
---
that Tess Durbeyfield had
 undertaken
---
which that young man
 carefully cultivated in her by playful dialogue, and by jestingly
 calling her his cousin when they were alone
---
A
 familiarity with Alec d'Urberville's presence---- removed much of her
 original shyness of him, without, however,. 
---
that whistling to the bullfinches in Mrs
 d'Urberville's room was no such onerous business,
---
Mrs d'Urberville slept in a large four- post bedstead
---
Thereupon her whistling became so disjointed that the
 listener, if such there were, must have discovered her suspicion of
 his presence. 
---
Alec d'Urberville had evidently
 thought better of his freak.




---
that parish relief
 was a fuller provision for a man in his old age than any which could
 result from savings out of their wages during a whole lifetime
---
But
 under pressure from matrons not much older than herself-- for a
 field- man's wages being as high at twenty- one as at forty, marriage
 was early here--
---
He lived in an out- of- the- way nook of the townlet, and in
 trying to find her course thither her eyes fell upon Mr d'Urberville
 standing at a street corner.

" What-- my Beauty? 
---
?" he said.


---
he over her shoulder as she went on down
 the back lane
---
he explained. 
---
which be their
 fancy- men
---
Alec d'Urberville was standing there alone
---
He beckoned to her, and
---
He had not put himself forward into the light, but
---
some of them
 had perceived him, and
---
his presence led to a slight pause and a
 consideration of how the time was flying. 
---
as he had re
---
that the fresh night air was producing
 staggerings and serpentine courses among the men who had partaken too
 freely
---
; some of the more careless women also were wandering in their
 gait-- to wit, a dark virago, Car Darch, dubbed Queen of Spades, till
 lately a favourite of d'Urberville's; Nancy, her sister, nicknamed
 the Queen of Diamonds; and the young married woman who had already
 tumbled down. 
---
" Ah, th'st think th' beest everybody, dostn't, because th' beest
 first favourite with He just now! 
---
Alec d'Urberville looked round
 upon them.


---
"?" he asked.


---
, he did

---
Having heard their voices while yet some way off he
 had ridden creepingly forward, and.


---
He bent over
 towards her. 
---
" Jump up behind me," he whispered," and
---
Each pedestrian could see
 no halo but his or her own, which never deserted the head- shadow,
 whatever its vulgar unsteadiness might be; but
---
that the horse was not the spirited one
 he sometimes rose, and
---
though her seat
 was precarious enough despite her tight hold of him
---
which Alec accordingly did
---
"?" he said by and by.


---
Nevertheless, Alec did not object to
 that confession. 
---
He knew.

---
In that moment of oblivion her head sank gently against
 him.


---
D'Urberville stopped the horse,.


---
In his ticklish position he nearly lost his
 balance and.


---
he rode

"!" he said. 
---
" he burst out,? 
---
He settled the matter by clasping his arm and

as he desired,

though not
 till he had stolen a cursory kiss
---
He sprang down on the other side.


---
" He's had enough of it for to- night."


---
He turned the horse's head into the bushes,.

"
---
," he said. 
---
He took a few steps away from her, but,
---
" By the bye,
 Tess, your father has a new cob to- day
---
Somebody gave it to him."


---
You!"

 D'Urberville nodded.


---
The sudden vision of his passion for herself as a factor in this
 result so distressed her that, beginning with one slow tear, and
 then following with another, she wept outright.


---
"?" he asked.


---
He touched her with his fingers, which sank into her as into down.

---
He pulled off a
 light overcoat that he had worn, and.

---
"," he continued. 
---
he plunged into the
 webs of vapour which by this time formed veils between the trees.

---
as he ascended the
 adjoining slope, and
---
till his movements were no louder than the hopping
 of a bird,
---
In the meantime Alec d'Urberville had pushed on up the slope. 
---
He
 had
---
A little rest for the jaded animal being desirable,
 he did not hasten his search for landmarks. 
---
A clamber over the
 hill into the adjoining vale brought him to the fence of a highway
,. 
---
whose contours he recognized
---
D'Urberville thereupon turned back; but
---
He was obliged, and. 
---
from which he had started
---
Roaming
 up and down, round and round, he at length heard a slight movement of
 the horse close at hand; and
---
the sleeve of his overcoat unexpectedly
 caught his foot.

"
---
The obscurity was now so great that he could
 see absolutely nothing but a pale nebulousness at his feet, which
 represented the white muslin figure he had left upon the dead leaves.

---
D'Urberville stooped; and. 
---
He knelt and
---
till her breath
 warmed his face, and
---
his cheek was in contact with hers.

 or
---
he was pursuing, or

he was in a journey, or

he was sleeping and

---
, the wrong man the
 woman, the wrong woman the man, many thousand years of analytical
 philosophy have failed. 
---
some of Tess d'Urberville's mailed ancestors
 rollicking home from a fray
---
It was a Sunday morning in late October, about four months after Tess
 Durbeyfield's arrival at Trantridge, and some few weeks subsequent to
 the night ride in The Chase. 
---
which d'Urberville had driven her so
 wildly on that day in June
---
who
 held up his hand
---
said d'Urberville, with
 upbraiding breathlessness;" on a Sunday morning, too,! 
---
D'Urberville mechanically lit a cigar, and
---
He had quite forgotten his struggle to kiss her when,
 in the early summer. 
---
?" he coldly asked.


---
He shrugged his shoulders. 
---
as the latent spirit( of which he was)
---
," he said,
---
He dropped into some little bitterness. 
---
as he
 continued:
---
"

" One would think, in addition
 to a true and original d'Urberville-- ha!
---
D'Urberville alighted, and
. 
---
Alec d'Urberville removed his cigar, bent towards her, and said--

! 
---
while he imprinted a kiss upon her cheek-- half
 perfunctorily, half as if zest had not yet quite died out
---
he kissed the other side,
.


---
his lips touching cheeks that were damp and smoothly chill as the
 skin of the mushrooms in the fields around
---
He emitted a laboured breath,.


---
as if the scene were getting rather
 oppressive to his heart, or to his conscience, or to his gentility
---
; I say it to you as a practical man and
 well- wisher. 
---
He leapt up lightly,.


---
, his rays, ungenial and peering, addressed the eye rather
 than the touch as yet. 
---
the
 footsteps of a man; and owing to the briskness of his advance he was
 close at her heels and. 
---
He appeared, and. 
---
He asked
 in a business- like manner.


---
if he should take her basket,
---
him to do
---
"!" he said cheerfully.


---
" All the week I work for the glory of man, and on Sunday for the
 glory of God. 
---
The man turned,, to an
 opening at the roadside leading into a pasture. 
---
as he spoke
---
," he added,"
---
As he had her basket she could not well do otherwise; and
---
He set down her basket and the tin pot, and.
                         2 Pet.
---
as if this
 man had known her recent history
---
he was a total stranger.


---
he picked up her basket
---
He shook his head.


---
"," he said. 
---
he replied in a trade voice.

---
It was with a sudden flush that she read and realized
 what was to be the inscription he was now halfway through--


       THOU, SHALT, NOT

On
 matrimony he had never once said a word. 
---
And what if he had? 
---
he took of her helplessness
---
winced before him, succumbed to adroit advantages
; then, temporarily blinded by his ardent
 manners, had suddenly
 despised and disliked him, and had run away.

he was dust and ashes to her, and.

The event of Tess Durbeyfield's return from the manor of her bogus
 kinsfolk was rumoured abroad,. 
---
that it was a gift from him
---
where only old men and women came, and
---
which he alone had

---
who had never heard of his name
---
His present aspect, coupled with the lack of all human forms in the
 scene, explained the old- time heliolatries in a moment. 
---
that
 was brimming with interest for him
---
His light, a little later, broke though chinks of cottage shutters,
 throwing stripes like red- hot pokers upon cupboards, chests of
 drawers, and other furniture within; and awakening harvesters who
 were not already astir.


---
Two groups, one of men and lads, the other of women, had come down
 the lane just at the hour,
---
some
 of them men in print shirts, and trousers supported round their
 waists by leather straps,.


---
as if they were a pair of eyes in the small of his back
---
A field- man is a
 personality afield
---
Tess Durbeyfield, otherwise d'Urberville, somewhat changed-- the
 same, but not the same
---
, the men plying a stone jar freely, and
---
Tess Durbeyfield had been one of the last.

---
The men turned their faces towards the
 other end of the field,
---
The harvest- men rose from the shock of corn, and. 
---
at which
 her father's sense of the antique nobility of his family was highest,
 and his sensitiveness to the smudge which Tess had set upon that
 nobility most pronounced

 booze at Rolliver's Inn

No parson should come inside his door

, he
 declared,. 
---
He locked the door
 and.


---
the arch- fiend
 tossing it with his three- pronged fork,
---
" What's his name going?"


---
SORROW, I baptize thee in the name of the Father, and of the Son,
 and of the Holy Ghost

the customary sentences as to his manfully fighting against sin,
 the world, and the devil, and
---
In the blue of the morning that fragile
 soldier and servant breathed his last, and
---
her
 terrors about his soul to have been somewhat exaggerated
---
he was a
 new- comer, and. 
---
He expressed his willingness to listen, and
---
" And now, sir," she
 added earnestly,"?"


---
will it be just the same for
 him
---
as if you had baptized him

he
 should have been called in for

that a job had been unskilfully botched by his
 customers among themselves

Having the natural feelings of a tradesman at finding, he was disposed. 
---
that he had left in
 him after ten years of endeavour
---
The man and the ecclesiastic fought within him, and
---
the
 victory fell to the man.


---
," he said,
---
himself cornered
---
Hearing of the baby's illness, he
 had conscientiously gone to the house after nightfall, and, unaware
---
that the refusal to admit him had come from Tess's
 father and not from Tess
---
to perform the
 rite, he could not allow the plea of necessity
 for its irregular administration.

" Ah
---
," he said.


---
He withdrew it,.


---
" Perhaps it will be just the same to him?... 
---
How the Vicar reconciled his answer with the strict notions he
 supposed himself to hold on these subjects. 
---
Somewhat moved, he said in
 this case."

where He lets

Tess
 Durbeyfield's experience was of this incapacitating kind. 
---
which d'Urberville had given
 her
---
It is the----th, the day that poor Tess Durbeyfield died"; and

---
for they were not Blakemore men,
---
not only that d'Urberville, like Babylon, had fallen,
 but
---
While waiting, however,
 there came along a farmer in his spring cart,. 
---
Though he was
---
He was going to
 Weatherbury, and.


---
Pooh-- I have as much of
 mother as father in me!
---
Children of Men... bless ye the Lord,!"


---
while her father did nothing of the kind
---
Tess Durbeyfield, then, in good heart, and full of zest for life,
 descended the Egdon slopes lower and lower towards the dairy of her
 pilgrimage.


---
One of these was a sturdy middle- aged man
---
-- whose long white" pinner"
 was somewhat finer and cleaner than the wraps of the others, and
 whose jacket underneath had a presentable marketing aspect-- the
 master- dairyman, of whom she was in quest, his double character as
 a working milker and butter maker here during six days, and on the
 seventh as a man in shining broad- cloth in his family pew at church,
:


              Dairyman Dick
              All the week:--
      On Sundays Mister Richard Crick.



---
he went across to her.


---
he received her warmly;
---
merely,
 for in reality he had not been aware of Mrs Durbeyfield's existence

---
," he
 said terminatively. 
---
he surveyed her up and down.

---
," he said indifferently, while
 holding up the pail that she sipped from. 
---
," he pursued,. 
---
The milkers formed quite a little battalion of men and maids, the
 men operating on the hard- teated animals, the maids on the kindlier
 natures. 
---
of the herd the
 master- dairyman milked six or eight with his own hands, unless away
 from home
---
his
 journey- milkmen being
---
; for more or less casually hired, he would not
 entrust this half- dozen to their treatment, lest, from indifference,

---
the dairyman, rising suddenly from a cow
 he had just finished off,," to my thinking
---
When they had gone through fourteen
 or fifteen verses of a cheerful ballad about a murderer who was
 afraid to go to bed in the dark because he saw certain brimstone
 flames around him, one of the male milkers said--

" I wish singing on the stoop did n't use up so much of a man's wind!

---
Once there was an old aged man over at
 Mellstock-- William Dewy by name-- one of the family that used to do
 a good deal of business as tranters over there--
---
Jonathan, do ye
 mind?--I knowed the man by sight as well as I know my own brother, in
 a manner of speaking. 
---
Well, this man was a coming home along from a
 wedding, where he had been playing his fiddle, one fine moonlight
 night, and
---
for shortness' sake he took a cut across Forty- acres,. 
---
The bull seed
 William, and took after him, horns aground, begad; and
---
though William
 runned his best, and
---
had n't MUCH drink in him( considering' twas a
 wedding, and the folks well off), he found. 
---
he'd never reach the fence
 and
---
Well, as a last thought, he
 pulled out his fiddle. 
---
as he runned, and
---
But no sooner
 did William stop his playing and. 
---
Well, William had; and. 
---
When he had scraped
---
till about four
 o'clock he felt
---
that he verily would have, and
---
he
 said to himself,'!
---
I'm a done man.' 
---
Well, then he called to
 mind. 
---
how he'd seen the cattle kneel o' Christmas Eves in the dead o'
 night
---
it came into his head. 
---
So he broke into the' Tivity Hymm, just
 as at Christmas carol- singing
---
as his horned friend were down
---
As soon,
 William turned,. 
---
before the praying bull had got on his feet again
---
William used... 
---
that he'd seen, but

a man look a fool
 a good many times

when
 he found

his pious feelings had been played upon, and

that was the man's name; and

Yes, William Dewy, I can tell you to a foot where's he a- lying in Mellstock Churchyard
 at this very moment-- just between the second yew- tree and the north
 aisle."

 was taken, except that the narrator seemed to think it might imply
 scepticism as to his tale.


---
I knowed the man well."


---
his burying his
 head so persistently in the flank of the milcher
---
why he should be addressed as" sir" even by the dairyman
 himself
---
; he remained under the
 cow long enough to have milked three, uttering a private ejaculation
 now and then,.


---
as if he could not get on
---
He wore the ordinary white
 pinner and leather leggings of a dairy- farmer, and
---
his
 boots were clogged with the mulch of the yard; but
---
this was all his
 local livery. 
---
But the details of his aspect were temporarily thrust aside by
 the discovery. 
---
that he was one whom she had seen before
---
that he was the pedestrian who had joined in the
 club- dance at Marlott-- the passing stranger who had come
---
that since their first and only encounter his mobile
 face had grown more thoughtful, and
---
where it began upon his cheeks
---
Under his linen milking- pinner he wore a dark
 velveteen jacket, cord breeches and gaiters, and a starched white
 shirt. 
---
what
 he was
---
He might with equal probability have been an eccentric
 landowner or a gentlemanly ploughman. 
---
That he was but a novice at
 dairy work she had realized in a moment, from the time he had spent
 upon the milking of one cow.


---
Mr Angel Clare-- he milking never says much to us. 
---
He is a pa'son's son, and. 
---
He is
 the dairyman's pupil--. 
---
He
 has learnt sheep- farming at another place, and
---
he's now mastering
 dairy- work.... 
---
Yes, he is.

His father is
 the Reverent Mr Clare at Emminster-- a good many miles from here."

" Oh-- I have heard of him

" A very
 earnest clergyman, is he not?"

that he is-- the earnestest man in all Wessex

All his sons, except our Mr Clare, be made
 pa'sons too."

 Clare was not made a parson like his brethren, and

XVIII


 Angel Clare rises out of the past not altogether as a distinct
 figure, but as an appreciative voice, a long regard of fixed,
 abstracted eyes, and a mobility of mouth somewhat too small and
 delicately lined for a man's, though with an unexpectedly firm close
 of the lower lip now and then; enough to do away with any inference
 of indecision. 
---
Nevertheless, something nebulous, preoccupied, vague,
 in his bearing and regard, marked him as one who probably had no very
 definite aim or concern about his material future. 
---
Yet as a lad
 people had said of him.


---
that he was one who might do anything if he
 tried
---
He was the youngest son of his father, a poor parson at the other end
 of the county, and.


---
his object being

---
His entry into the ranks of the agriculturists and breeders was a
 step in the young man's career which had been anticipated neither
 by himself nor by others.


---
Mr Clare the elder, whose first wife had died and. 
---
so that between Angel, the
 youngest, and his father the Vicar there seemed
---
Of these boys the aforesaid Angel, the child of
 his old age, was the only son who had not taken a University degree,
.


---
though he was the single one of them
---
when he had left school and
---
Some two or three years before Angel's appearance at the Marlott
 dance, on a day was pursuing his studies
 at home, a parcel came to the Vicarage from the local bookseller's,
. 
---
whereupon he jumped up
 from his seat and
---
"?" he asked peremptorily,.


---
The shopkeeper looked into his order- book.


---
", sir," he said. 
---
" It was ordered by Mr
 Angel Clare, and."


---
Mr Clare winced. 
---
as if he had been struck
---
He went home pale and
 dejected, and.


---
" Look into this book, my boy," he said. 
---
"," said Angel simply.


---
"," said the son, with
 anxious thought upon his face,". 
---
the straightforward and simple- minded Vicar
 that one of his own flesh and blood could come to this! 
---
He was
 stultified, shocked, paralysed. 
---
if Angel were not going
---
The
 University as a step to anything but ordination seemed, to this man
 of fixed ideas, a preface without a volume. 
---
He was a man not merely
 religious, but devout
---
Angel's father tried argument, persuasion, entreaty.


---
," said Angel. 
---
His father grieved so deeply that it made Angel quite ill to see him.


---
" his father repeated.

"
---
Why, that it may be used for the honour and glory of man, father."


---
if Angel had persevered
---
Perhaps he might have gone to Cambridge like
 his brothers. 
---
as his
 father had hinted,
---
"," said Angel at last. 
---
He spent years and years in desultory studies,
 undertakings, and meditations
---
; he began. 
---
The material
 distinctions of rank and wealth he increasingly despised. 
---
Even the
" good old family"( to use a favourite phrase of a late local worthy)
 had no aroma for him. 
---
when he went and
---
As a balance to these austerities, to
 live in London to see, with a view to
 practising a profession or business there, he was carried off his
 head, and,.


---
nearly entrapped by a woman much older than himself
---
though
 luckily he escaped not greatly the worse for the experience
---
Early association with country solitudes had bred in him an
 unconquerable, and almost unreasonable, aversion to modern town life,
 and shut him out from such success as he might have aspired to by
 following a mundane calling in the impracticability of the spiritual
 one. 
---
to be done; he had wasted many valuable
 years; and
---
having an acquaintance, it occurred to Angel. 
---
Farming, either in the Colonies, America, or
 at home-- farming, at any rate, after becoming well qualified for the
 business by a careful apprenticeship-- that was a vocation which would
 probably afford an independence without the sacrifice of what he
 valued even more than a competency-- intellectual liberty.


---
So we find Angel Clare at six- and- twenty here at Talbothays as a
 student of kine, and,
---
in which
 he could get a comfortable lodging, a boarder at the dairyman's.


---
His room was an immense attic which ran the whole length of the
 dairy- house. 
---
till he arrived
 and
---
Here Clare had plenty of space, and
. 
---
behind which was his bed, the outer part being furnished
 as a homely sitting- room.


---
At first he lived up above entirely,, and
. 
---
which he had bought at a sale
---
when
 in a bitter humour that he might have
---
But he soon preferred
---
to read human nature by
 taking his meals downstairs in the general dining- kitchen, with the
 dairyman and his wife, and the maids and men,; for though but few milking hands slept in the
 house,
---
The longer Clare resided
 here the less objection
---
Much to his surprise he took, indeed, a real delight in their
 companionship. 
---
The conventional farm- folk of his imagination--
-- were obliterated after a few days' residence. 
---
when Clare's
 intelligence was fresh from a contrasting society
---
these friends with
 whom he now hobnobbed
---
His host and his host's
 household, his men and his maids, intimately known to
 Clare, began.

---
The thought of Pascal's was brought home to him:"_
---
He had been

---
as he had
 of his friends
---
disintegrated into a number of varied fellow- creatures-- beings of
 many minds, beings infinite in difference; some happy, many serene, a
 few depressed, one here and there bright even to genius, some stupid,
 others wanton, others austere; some mutely Miltonic, some potentially
 Cromwellian-- into men; condemn each other, amuse or
 sadden themselves by the contemplation of each other's foibles or
 vices; men every one of whom walked in his own individual way the
 road to dusty death.


---
Unexpectedly he began and for what it brought, apart from its bearing on his own proposed
 career. 
---
Considering his position he became wonderfully free from the
 chronic melancholy which is taking hold of the civilized races with
 the decline of belief in a beneficent Power. 
---
For the first time of
 late years he could read.


---
as his musings inclined him, without any eye
 to cramming for a profession,
---
which
 he deemed it desirable to master
---
since the few farming handbooks occupied him but little time
---
He grew away from old associations, and. 
---
Secondarily, he made close acquaintance with phenomena
 which he had before known but darkly-- the seasons in their moods,
 morning and evening, night and noon, winds in their different
 tempers, trees, waters and mists, shades and silences, and the voices
 of inanimate things.



---
that he was too genteel to mess at
 their table
---
by
 Mrs Crick's orders,, it was Angel Clare's custom to sit in the yawning
 chimney- corner during the meal
---
, his cup- and- saucer and plate being
 placed on a hinged flap at his elbow. 
---
The light from the long, wide,
 mullioned window opposite shone in upon his nook, and,
 enabled him. 
---
Between
 Clare and the window was the table at which his companions sat, their
 munching profiles rising sharp against the panes;. 
---
the moving power being discernible through the
 window in the form of a spiritless horse walking in a circle and
 driven by a boy
---
that the babble did not
 strike him as possessing a new note,
---
he was ever in the habit
 of neglecting the particulars of an outward scene for the general
 impression. 
---
when he had been conning one of his
 music- scores, and by force of imagination
---
One day, however, was hearing the tune in
 his head, he lapsed into listlessness, and
---
He looked at the fire of logs, with its one flame
 pirouetting on the top in a dying dance after the breakfast- cooking
 and boiling, and
---
till he thought
---
The conversation at the table mixed
 in with his phantasmal orchestra:" What a fluty voice
 one of those milkmaids has! 
---
Clare looked round upon her,.


---
Indeed, owing to his long silence,
 his presence in the room was almost forgotten.


---
The dairyman turned to her with his mouth full
---
, his eyes charged
 with serious inquiry, and his great knife and fork
---
?" he said.


---
The dairyman removed his hard gaze from Tess, and.


---
Clare continued. 
---
that Clare was regarding her
---
"!" he
 said to himself.


---
And then he seemed,
 something which carried him back into a joyous and unforeseeing past,
. 
---
He
 concluded;. 
---
that he had beheld her before
---
where he could not tell
---
he was not greatly curious about it. 
---
But the circumstance was
 sufficient to lead him to select Tess in preference to the other
 pretty milkmaids.




---
when he wished
---
, he was

---
," said he. 
---
that he, unaware of
 her grave reasons for liking this seclusion, might have mistaken
---
as if his presence
 were somehow a factor in her wish
---
that he might not guess her presence
---
which, though
 snow- white on the apple- tree trunks, made madder stains on her skin;
 thus she drew quite near to Clare, still unobserved of him
---
He concluded his
 plaintive melody, a very simple performance,; and
---
But, tired
 of playing, he had desultorily come round the fence, and. 
---
Angel, however, saw her light summer gown, and
---
he spoke
---
; his low
 tones reaching her,.


---
though he was some distance off
---
"" said he. 
---
that he meant
---
He was surprised to find this young woman-- who though but a milkmaid
 had just that touch of rarity about her which might make her the
 envied of her housemates-- shaping such sad imaginings. 
---
The perception arrested him less

---
when he reflected the latest fashion in definition-- a more accurate
 expression, by words in_ logy_ and
---
which men and
 women have vaguely grasped for centuries
---
Not guessing the cause, there was nothing to remind him that
 experience is as to intensity, and not as to duration. 
---
why a man of clerical family
 and good education, and above physical want, should look upon it as a
 mishap to be alive
---
But how could this admirable and poetic man ever have
 descended into the Valley of Humiliation
---
that he was at present out of his class
---
only because, like Peter the Great in a shipwright's yard,
 he was studying
---
what he wanted
---
because
 he was obliged to milk cows
---
because he was learning
---
He would become an American or Australian Abraham,
. 
---
that a decidedly
 bookish, musical, thinking young man should have chosen
---
He observed her dejection one day, when he had casually mentioned
 something to her about pastoral life in ancient Greece. 
---
while he
 spoke
---
" he asked.


---
Why," he said with
 some enthusiasm,".


---
Of course he spoke with a
 conventional sense of duty only, for that sort of wondering. 
---
as he looked at the
 unpracticed mouth and lips
---
And, he thought. 
---
When he was gone
---
How stupid he must think her! 
---
if he knew
---
Mr Clare," said the dairyman emphatically," and
---
if there's one thing that he do hate more than another
' tis the notion of what's called a' old family. 
---
He says. 
---
Well, Mr Clare found this out, and. ' Ah!'
---
he says to her,'! 
---
A boy came here t'other day, and. ' Ah!
---
his name was Matt, and
---
when we asked him his surname

---
he said
---
he'd never heard
---
why, he said
---
he supposed
---
his folks had n't been
---
you're the very boy!'
---
says Mr Clare,. 
---
he ca n't stomach old families!"


---
The insight afforded into Clare's character.




---
So he allowed,.


---
his mind to be

---
By the time Clare was
 downstairs and out in the humid air. 
---
where he was generally awaiting her
---
both of disposition and physique, an almost
 regnant power, possibly because he knew that at that preternatural
 time hardly any woman so well endowed in person as she was likely to
 be walking in the open air within the boundaries of his horizon; very
 few in all England. 
---
him think of the
 Resurrection hour
---
that the Magdalen might be
 at his side
---
Whilst all the landscape was in neutral shade his
 companion's face,,. 
---
which was the focus of his eyes,
---
; his own face, though he did not think of
 it,.


---
He called her Artemis,
 Demeter, and other fanciful names half teasingly, which she did not
 like.


---
he did.


---
Dairyman Crick and his wife, the milkmaids Tess, Marian, Retty
 Priddle, Izz Huett, and the married ones from the cottages; also
 Mr Clare, Jonathan Kail, old Deborah, and the rest, stood; and
---
the boy going outside
 put on moon- like eyes. 
---
" And he was nothing to what his father
 had been. 
---
if he's alive
---
Even Mr Clare began.

"
---
Conjuror Fall, t'other side of Casterbridge, to call
' Wide- O', was a very good man when I was a boy
---
" But he's rotten as touchwood by now."


---
He turned to Clare.

"
---
her
 as he had deceived many afore
---
But he had another sort o' woman to
 reckon wi' this time, and
---
,
 only there was when we zid the girl's mother
 coming up to the door, wi' a great brass- mounted umbrella in her
 hand that would ha' felled an ox, and saying' Do Jack Dollop work
 here?--because I want him! 
---
I have a big bone to pick with he
---
And with that he scrambled into the churn through the trap- door, and
. '
---
The villain-- where is he?'
---
I'll claw
 his face
---
me only catch him
---
that he was inside that
---
he, popping
 out his head
---
( He was a cowardly
 chap in his heart,). '
---
as such men mostly be
---
screams he. '
---
Yes-- I'll be as good as
 my word!' he said. 
---
He went forward and
---
" Why, maidy"( he frequently, with unconscious irony, gave her this
 pet name)," the prettiest milker I've got in my dairy
---
you to be in love with him any more than me, Retty
 Priddle
---
" His thoughts
 be of other cheeks than thine!"


---
There he is again!"
---
you
 kissing his shade
---
Why-- he was standing over the whey- tub, and
---
the
 shade of his face came upon the wall behind, close to Izz,. 
---
kissed the shade of his mouth; I zid her,."


---
though he did n't
---
Ah, there he is again! 
---
We ca n't all marry him
---
" There he is again!"


---
Because he likes Tess Durbeyfield best
---
" I have watched him every day, and."


---
" Of course
 he wo n't marry any one of us, or Tess either-- a gentleman's son,
 who's going to be a great landowner and farmer abroad! 
---
But
 the unconscious Mr Clare had gone indoors, and
---
they saw him no more;
 and.

---
him ascend the ladder to his own room
---
that only the
 slightest ordinary care was necessary for holding her own in Angel
 Clare's heart against these her candid friends
---
while he stayed here
---
, what would be the use of his marrying a fine lady,
 and all the while ten thousand acres of Colonial pasture to feed,
 and cattle to rear, and corn to reap. 
---
whether Mr Clare had spoken
 seriously or not
---
any man to marry her now,
---
while he remained at Talbothays
---
He had

---
said the dairyman, who held in his left hand
 a wooden slice on which a lump of butter was stuck.
---
Several of them gathered round him; and
---
Mr Clare tasted
---
who had thrown himself into abstraction to
---
"," he resumed
---
However, they formed themselves into line,; the dairyman at
 the upper end with Mr Clare, who had volunteered to help; then
 Tess, Marian, Izz Huett, and Retty; then Bill Lewell, Jonathan, and
 the married dairywomen-- Beck Knibbs, with her wooly black hair and
 rolling eyes; and flaxen Frances, consumptive from the winter damps
 of the water- meads-- who lived in their respective cottages.


---
who communistically stuck to his rule of taking part
 with the rest in everything
---
Angel Clare,, glanced up now and then. 
---
that he walked next to Tess
---
?" he murmured.


---
, the hem of her petticoat just touching his gaiter,
 and. 
---
his elbow sometimes brushing hers
---
"" he exclaimed,. 
---
Mr Clare also
 stepped out of line, and. 
---
Clare remained.


---
their observing him
---
that Clare
 remained behind
---
rightly or wrongly, the self- controlling sense of duty shown
 by him, a quality which she had never expected to find in one of the
 opposite sex, and in the absence of which more than one of the simple
 hearts who were his house- mates might have gone weeping on her
 pilgrimage.




---
His aspect was probably as un- Sabbatarian a one as a dogmatic
 parson's son
---
his attire being his dairy clothes
---
He's not going to
 church
---
he was
---
This morning, moreover,
 he had gone out. 
---
On his walk he observed the girls from a long
 distance,. 
---
He knew. 
---
So he had
.


---
how he could help them-- one of them
 in particular
---
that he stopped a moment
---
Angel's eye at last fell
 upon Tess, the hindmost of the four
---
He came beneath them in the water, which did not rise over his long
 boots; and.


---
" to get to church?" he said to Marian, who was in
 front,, but.


---
Now, Marian,
 attend," he continued," and, so.

---
Angel strode off with her, his slim figure,,
.

---
only his sousing
 footsteps and the top ribbon of Marian's bonnet told.

---
In a few minutes he reappeared. 
---
" Here he comes. 
---
Angel Clare, now approached Izz. 
---
Angel methodically
 marched off with her. 
---
When he was heard
---
He went
 up to the red- haired girl, and
---
while he was seizing her
---
he glanced at
 Tess. 
---
His lips could not have pronounced more plainly,
---
However, he got through with the disquieted creature,. 
---
as he had placed them on the next rising ground
---
"," he whispered.


---
" Not to me," said Angel.


---
He saw; and
---
Clare stood still and.


---
" O Tessy!" he exclaimed.


---
It reminded Angel; and
---
that he was
---
he went no
 further with it. 
---
However,
 he walked slowly, as long as
 possible; but
---
he set her down.


---
He hastily bade
 them farewell, and.


---
He likes' ee best-- the very best! 
---
as he brought
' ee
---
He would have kissed' ee,."


---
if you had encouraged him,
 ever so little
---
marrying is in
 his mind at all
---
if he were ever
---
to ask me I should refuse him,
."


---
as I should refuse any man
---
he will choose either of you
---
that he was

---
as he held me
---
I lay still against his breast,
 and
---
But he did not. 
---
; while lacking nothing in the eye of Nature;-- all this
 imparted to them a resignation, a dignity, which a practical and
 sordid expectation of winning him as a husband would have destroyed.


---
his family have looked
 out for him!
---
" Some lady looked out for him?". 
---
chosen by his
 family
---
; a young lady of his own rank,; a Doctor of Divinity's daughter near his father's parish of
 Emminster; he do n't much care for her
---
But he is sure to
 marry her."


---
They
 pictured all the details of his being won round to consent, of the
 wedding preparations, of the bride's happiness, of her dress and
 veil, of her blissful home with him, when oblivion would have fallen
 upon themselves as far as he and their love were concerned. 
---
that she whom he really did prefer in a cursory way
 to the rest, she who knew herself to be more impassioned in nature,
 cleverer, more beautiful than they, was in the eyes of propriety far
 less worthy of him than the homelier ones whom he ignored.




---
as Clare was oppressed by the outward
 heats
---
And, so was he burdened inwardly by waxing fervour of passion for
 the soft and silent Tess.


---
as he sped home from market,
---
; Dairyman Crick kept his shirt- sleeves
---
, Angel Clare,,
 asked her. 
---
then Angel felt inclined to go round the corner also, to finish off a
 hard- yielding milcher who had strayed there,.


---
he being now as capable
 of this as the dairyman himself
---
All the men, and some of the women, when milking, dug their foreheads
 into the cows and. 
---
This was Tess Durbeyfield's
 habit
---
that Clare had followed her round, and
---
that he sat
 under his cow
---
How very lovable her face was to him. 
---
he had seen before, and cheeks perhaps as fair; brows as
 arched, a chin and throat almost as shapely; her mouth he had seen
 nothing to equal on the face of the earth
---
He had never before
 seen a woman's lips and teeth which forced upon his mind with such
 persistent iteration the old Elizabethan simile of roses filled with
 snow. 
---
Perfect, he, as a lover, might have called them off- hand. 
---
Clare had studied the curves of those lips so many times
---
that he
 could reproduce them mentally with ease: and now,
---
as they again
 confronted him,
---
clothed with colour and life, they sent an_ aura_
 over his flesh, a breeze through his nerves, which well nigh produced
 a qualm; and.


---
that he was observing her
---
that had passed into Clare like an excitation from the
 sky
---
He jumped up from his seat,
 and,
---
Having seen that it was really her
 lover who had advanced, and no one else, her lips parted, and she
 sank upon him in her momentary joy, with something very like an
 ecstatic cry.


---
He had been on the point of kissing that too tempting mouth, but
---
he
 checked himself, for tender conscience' sake.


---
" Forgive me, Tess dear!" he whispered. 
---
his arm still
 encircling her
---
he said.


---
"," said he, with a
 curious sigh of desperation,. 
---
that his heart
 had outrun his judgement
---
He had allowed. 
---
which, had he known its quality
---
, the
 dairyman would have despised, as a practical man;

END OF PHASE THE THIRD





 Phase the Fourth: The Consequence



 XXV


 Clare, restless, went out into the dusk when evening drew on
---
who
 had won him
---
He sat on the east gate of the dairy- yard, and. 
---
while the novelty, unpremeditation, mastery of circumstance
 disquieted him
---
that he was
---
He
 could hardly realize their true relations to each other as yet, and
.


---
Angel had come as pupil to this dairy in the idea that his temporary
 existence here was to be the merest episode in his life,
---
soon passed
 through and early forgotten; he had come as to a place. 
---
from which
 as from a screened alcove he could calmly view the absorbing world
 without, and,
---
apostrophizing it with Walt Whitman--


   Crowds of men and women attired in the usual costumes,
   How curious you are to me!--



---
as it had never, for him, started up
 elsewhere
---
Every window of the house being open, Clare could hear across the
 yard each trivial sound of the retiring household. 
---
that he had never hitherto deemed it of sufficient importance

---
Many besides
 Angel have learnt but as to their subjective experiences. 
---
Looking at it thus, he found.


---
Despite his heterodoxy, faults, and weaknesses, Clare was a man with
 a conscience. 
---
upon which he had intruded
---
How then should he
 look upon her as of less consequence than himself
---
which he knew
---
that he had awakened in her-- so
 fervid and so impressionable as she was under her reserve-- in order
 that it might not agonize and wreck her
---
having arrived at no conclusion as to the issue of such a tendency,
 he decided. 
---
He was driven towards her by every heave of his pulse.


---
He thought. 
---
he would go and
---
In less than five months his term here
 would have ended, and after a few additional months spent upon other
 farms he would be fully equipped in agricultural knowledge and in
 a position to start on his own account. 
---
Notwithstanding the pleasing answer
 returned to him by the silence, he resolved.


---
" Mr Clare has gone hwome to Emminster
."


---
He's

---
he
 is beginning
---
he to bide here
---
He'll bide. 
---
He'll
 hang on till the end of the year
---
At this moment of the morning Angel Clare was riding along a narrow
 lane ten miles distant from the breakfasters, in the direction of
 his father's Vicarage at Emminster,. 
---
as he could
---
sent by Mrs Crick, with her kind respects, to his parents
---
The
 white lane stretched before him, and
---
his eyes were upon it; but. 
---
He loved her
---
he to marry her
---
he to marry her
---
What would he himself say a couple of years
 after the event? 
---
His father's hill- surrounded little town, the Tudor church- tower of
 red stone, the clump of trees near the Vicarage, came at last into
 view beneath him, and
---
he rode down towards the well- known gate.

---
Casting a glance in the direction of the church before entering his
 home, he beheld standing by the vestry- door a group of girls, of
 ages between twelve and sixteen, apparently awaiting the arrival of
 some other one, who in a moment became visible; a figure somewhat
 older than the school- girls, wearing a broad- brimmed hat and
 highly- starched cambric morning- gown, with a couple of books in her
 hand.


---
Clare knew her well. 
---
He could not be sure that she observed him
---
; he
 hoped. 
---
him decide
---
The young lady was Miss Mercy Chant, the only daughter of his
 father's neighbour and friend, whom it was his parents' quiet hope
 that he might we d some day. 
---
Clare's
 mind flew to the impassioned, summer- steeped heathens in the Var
 Vale, and to one
 the most impassioned of them all.


---
It was on the impulse of the moment that he had resolved to trot
 over to Emminster, and
---
He was
 a little late, and
---
as he
 entered
---
They were his father and mother, his brother the Reverend
 Felix-- curate at a town in the adjoining county, home for the inside
 of a fortnight-- and his other brother, the Reverend Cuthbert, the
 classical scholar, and Fellow and Dean of his College, down from
 Cambridge for the long vacation. 
---
silver spectacles, and his father looked. 
---
what in fact he was-- an
 earnest, God- fearing man, somewhat gaunt, in years about sixty- five
---
,
 his pale face lined with thought and purpose
---
Over their heads hung
 the picture of Angel's sister, the eldest of the family, sixteen
 years his senior,.


---
Old Mr Clare was a clergyman of a type which, within the last twenty
 years, has well nigh dropped out of contemporary life. 
---
, he had in his raw youth
---
He was regarded even by
 those of his own date and school of thinking as extreme; and for the remarkable power he
 showed in dismissing all question as to principles in his energy for
 applying them. 
---
while, on
 the other hand, those totally opposed to him were unwillingly won
 to admiration for his thoroughness,
---
He loved Paul of Tarsus,. 
---
as he dared, and
---
The New Testament was less a Christiad then a
 Pauliad to his intelligence-- less an argument than an intoxication.

---
His creed of determinism was such that it almost amounted to a
 vice, and quite amounted, on its negative side, to a renunciative
 philosophy which had cousinship with that of Schopenhauer and
 Leopardi. 
---
He despised the Canons and Rubric, swore by the Articles,
 and. 
---
in a
 way he might have been
---
he certainly was-- sincere.


---
which his son Angel had lately been experiencing in Var
 Vale
---
To the aesthetic, sensuous, pagan pleasure in natural life and lush
 womanhood, his temper would have been antipathetic in a high degree,. 
---
had
 he either by inquiry or imagination
---
Angel had been so unlucky as to say to his father, in
 a moment of irritation,
---
his father's grief was of that
 blank description
---
He had simply preached austerely at Angel for
 some time after. 
---
But the kindness of his heart was such that he
 never resented anything for long, and welcomed his son to- day with a
 smile which was as candidly sweet as a child's.


---
Angel sat down, and
---
he did not so much
 as formerly feel himself one of the family gathered there
---
that he returned
---
Every
 time hither he was conscious of this divergence,
 and
---
since he had last shared in the Vicarage life
---
it had grown even
 more distinctly foreign to his own than usual. 
---
Its transcendental
 aspirations-- still unconsciously based on the geocentric view of
 things, a zenithal paradise, a nadiral hell-- were as foreign to his
 own as if they had been the dreams of people on another planet.

---
Latterly he had seen only Life
---
On their part they saw a great difference in him, a growing
 divergence from the Angel Clare of former times. 
---
It was chiefly a
 difference in his manner. 
---
that they noticed just now, particularly
 his brothers
---
He was getting
---
to behave like a farmer; he flung
---
his
 legs about; the muscles of his face had grown more expressive
---
; his
 eyes looked as much information, and more. 
---
as his tongue spoke
---
The
 manner of the scholar had nearly disappeared; still more the manner
 of the drawing- room young man. 
---
that he had

---
that he had become coarse
---
After breakfast he walked with his two brothers, non- evangelical,
 well- educated, hall- marked young men,. 
---
him to grow dusty on
 their shelves
---
when he was decried in favour
 of Velasquez
---
If these two noticed Angel's growing social ineptness
---
, he noticed
 their growing mental limitations. 
---
Felix seemed to him all Church;
 Cuthbert all College. 
---
His Diocesan Synod and Visitations were the
 mainsprings of the world to the one; Cambridge to the other. 
---
that there were a few unimportant score
 of millions of outsiders in civilized society, persons who were
 neither University men nor churchmen
---
Felix, though an offshoot from a far more
 recent point in the devolution of theology than his father, was. 
---
More tolerant than his father of
 a contradictory opinion, in its aspect as a danger to its holder, he
 was less ready than his father to pardon it as a slight to his own
 teaching. 
---
Cuthbert was, upon the whole,
---
the more liberal- minded,
 though, with greater subtlety, he had not so much heart.


---
As they walked along the hillside Angel's former feeling revived
 in him-- that whatever their advantages by comparison with himself,
 neither saw or set forth life as it really was lived. 
---
Perhaps, as
 with many men, their opportunities of observation were not so good
 as their opportunities of expression. 
---
,"
 Felix was saying, among other things, to his youngest brother,
---
as
 he looked through his spectacles at the distant fields with sad
 austerity
---
" Of course," said Angel. 
---
" Now, Felix," said
---
Angel drily," we are very good friends
---
their father's and mother's morning work in the parish usually
 concluded. 
---
Angel in particular, who was now
 an outdoor man, accustomed to the profuse_
---
Angel looked round for Mrs Crick's
 black- puddings, which he had directed to be nicely grilled
---
of which he wished.


---
his father and mother
 to appreciate the marvellous herbal savours as highly as he did
 himself
---
my dear boy," observed
 Clare's mother. 
---
" But I am sure you will not mind doing without them
 as I am sure your father and I shall not, when you know the reason.

---
I suggested to him; and
---
that we should take Mrs Crick's kind present to
 the children of the man who can earn nothing just now because of his
 attacks of delirium tremens
---
he agreed;
---
said Angel.


---
" The truth, of course," said his father.


---
" You can not,," Mr Clare answered lucidly.

" Ah-- no;."


---
A what?" said Cuthbert and Felix both.


---
" Oh--'tis an expression," replied Angel,
. 
---
He felt and.




---
that his parents were right in their practice if
 wrong in their want of sentiment,
---
that Angel found
 opportunity of broaching to his father one or two subjects near his
 heart
---
He had strung himself up to the purpose,. 
---
Mr Clare and himself were left alone.


---
His father then told him.

" As far as worldly wealth goes."


---
as he
 had not been put to the expense of sending Angel up to Cambridge
---
that,, he
 had felt it his duty to set by a sum of money every year towards the
 purchase or lease of land for him some day
---
, that he might not feel

---
himself unduly slighted
---
," continued his father," you will no
 doubt stand far superior to your brothers in a few years
---
This considerateness on old Mr Clare's part led Angel onward to the
 other and dearer subject. 
---
He observed to his father. 
---
that he was
 then six- and- twenty, and
---
when he should start in the farming
 business
---
that he would require eyes in the back of his head
---
whilst he was afield
---
for him to marry
---
His father seemed; and
---
then Angel
 put the question--

" What kind of wife?"


---
Mr
 Clare, the elder, had plainly never thought of these points before.

---
" to add," he said,". 
---
But her father, quite as opposed to
 such flummery that can be cured. 
---
His father persisted in his conviction.

---
the
 impulsive Angel, wishing to honour his father's feelings and to
 advance the cause of his heart at the same time, grew specious
---
He said. 
---
that fate or Providence had thrown in his way a woman who
 possessed every qualification and
---
He would not say
; but
---
," said Angel,
 unflinchingly,". 
---
"?" said Angel quickly.

---
Angel waxed quite
 earnest on that rather automatic orthodoxy in his beloved Tess)
---
that it might stand him in such good stead
---
he had

---
whether their son had himself any right
 whatever to the title he claimed for the unknown young woman, Mr and
 Mrs Clare began to feel it as an advantage not to be overlooked that
 she at least was sound in her views; especially as the conjunction of
 the pair must have arisen by an act of Providence; for Angel never
 would have made orthodoxy a condition of his choice. 
---
Angel therefore refrained from declaring more particulars now.

---
He felt.

---
single- minded and self- sacrificing as his parents
 were
---
as he chose
---
For though legally at liberty to do, and,
 he wished for affection's sake.


---
He observed his own inconsistencies in dwelling upon accidents in
 Tess's life as if they were vital features. 
---
that
 he loved Tess; her soul, her heart, her substance-- not for her skill
 in the dairy, her aptness as his scholar, and certainly not for
 her simple formal faith- professions
---
He held. 
---
as he could see
---
confirmed by his experience of women,.


---
It was the morning of his departure. 
---
His brothers had already left
 the Vicarage,, and the other to his curacy. 
---
Angel
 might have accompanied them, but. 
---
He would have been an awkward member of the
 party
---
; for that his squareness
 would not fit the round hole that had been prepared for him. 
---
To
 neither Felix nor Cuthbert had he ventured.


---
his father accompanied him,
 on his own mare, a little way along the road. 
---
Having fairly well
 advanced his own affairs
---
, Angel listened in a willing silence, because of his strict interpretations of
 the New Testament by the light of what they deemed a pernicious
 Calvinistic doctrine.


---
as
 they jogged on together through the shady lanes, to his father's
 account of his parish difficulties, and the coldness of brother
 clergymen whom he loved,
---
" Pernicious!" said Mr Clare, with genial scorn; and.

---
he proceeded to
 recount experiences which would show the absurdity of that idea
---
He told of wondrous conversions of evil livers and
---
of which he had been
 the instrument, not only amongst the poor, but amongst the rich and
 well- to- do;
---
he also candidly admitted many failures.


---
As an instance of the latter, he mentioned the case of a young
 upstart squire named d'Urberville,.


---
" Not one of the ancient d'Urbervilles of Kingsbere and other places?"
 asked his son. "
---
even than I."

," said Angel with a
 little impatience
---
, though by no means a subtle one, was yet too
 subtle for Mr Clare the elder, and
---
he went on with the story he had
;
---
that after the death of the senior
 so- called d'Urberville, the young man developed the most culpable
 passions,
---
though he had a blind mother
---
him know better
---
A knowledge of his career having come to
 the ears of Mr Clare,. 
---
when he was in that part of the country

---
preaching missionary sermons, he boldly took occasion
---
Though he was a stranger,

---
occupying another's pulpit, he had felt this, and
!" 
---
The young man much resented this
 directness of attack, and in the war of words which followed when
 they met he did not scruple publicly to insult Mr Clare, without
 respect for his gray hairs.


---
Angel flushed with distress.

"
---
Dear father," he said sadly,"!"


---
" Pain?" said his father, his rugged face shining in the ardour of
 self- abnegation. 
---
" The only pain to me was pain on his account, poor,
 foolish young man. 
---
his incensed words could give
 me any pain, or even his blows
---
He did not proceed to blows?"


---
" No, he did not. 
---
Though I have borne from men in a mad state
 of intoxication."


---
" May this young man do the same!
---
" said Angel fervently. 
---
", nevertheless," said Mr Clare. 
---
But, after all, one of those poor words of mine may
 spring up in his heart as a good seed some day."


---
Now, as always, Clare's father was sanguine as a child; and
---
though
 the younger could not accept his parent's narrow dogma
---
, he revered
 his practice and. 
---
Perhaps he
 revered his father's practice even more now than ever,.

---
Angel
 admired it
---
Indeed, despite his own heterodoxy, Angel
 often felt.




---
that he was nearer to his father on the human side than
 was either of his brethren
---
XXVII


 An up- hill and down- hill ride of twenty- odd miles through a garish
 mid- day atmosphere brought him in the afternoon to a detached knoll
 a mile or two west of Talbothays, whence he again looked into that
 green trough of sappiness and humidity, the valley of the Var or
 Froom. 
---
Immediately he began
---
Clare was now so familiar with
 the spot that he knew the individual cows by their names when
---
, a long
 distance off, he saw. 
---
that he recognized his power of viewing life here
 from its inner side, in a way that had been quite foreign to him in
 his student- days; and
---
as he loved his parents
---
much, he could not
 help
---
At the door the wood- hooped pails, sodden and, hung like hats on a stand upon the forked and peeled limb
 of an oak fixed there for that purpose; all of them ready and dry
 for the evening milking. 
---
Angel entered, and. 
---
where he listened for a
 moment
---
Sustained snores came from the cart- house, where some of
 the men were lying down
---
He unbridled and
---
as he re- entered the house
---
, Clare heard the creaking of the floor- boards above, and
 then the touch of a descending foot on the stairs
---
It was Tess's,
 who in another moment came down before his eyes.


---
him enter, and
---
he saw the red interior of her mouth. 
---
that he could see its satin delicacy above
 the sunburn
---
How you frightened me-- I--"

 There had not at first been time for her to think of the changed
 relations which his declaration had introduced; but the full sense of
 the matter rose up in her face when she encountered Clare's tender
 look as he stepped forward to the bottom stair.


---
he whispered,, and
 his face to her flushed cheek. 
---
Tess's excitable heart beat against his by way of reply; and
---
the sun slanting in
 by the window upon his back
---
as he held her tightly to his breast
---
his plumbed the deepness of the ever- varying pupils, with
 their radiating fibrils of blue, and black, and gray, and violet,
.


---
," said Mr Clare, upwards. 
---
the ardour of his affection being so palpable
 that she seemed to flinch under it like a plant in too burning a sun
---
Then he pressed her again to his side, and
---
, he cleaned
 it in nature's way;.


---
", dearest," he resumed gently. 
---
He put it that way.


---
he had yielded to an
 impulse of which
---
his head would disapprove
---
" he said,
---
Your father is a parson, and
---
"," he
 said. 
---
Not to agitate and hinder her longer, the considerate Clare began
. 
---
who had
 never heard him at all
---
that his
 father could not object to her on religious grounds,
---
He
 himself knew, Tractarian as to
 phraseology, and Pantheistic as to essence. 
---
He had occasionally thought the counsel less honest than musical; but

---
he gladly conformed to it now.


---
He spoke further of the incidents of his visit, of his father's mode
 of life, of his zeal for his principles
---
after another he followed her
---
well, my father had been talking a good deal to me of his
 troubles and difficulties, and
---
He is so zealous that he gets many snubs and buffetings from
 people of a different way of thinking from himself, and
---
He has been telling me of a very unpleasant scene in
 which. 
---
he took part quite recently
---
He went as the deputy of some
 missionary society to preach in the neighbourhood of Trantridge, a
 place forty miles from here, and.

---
he met with somewhere about there
---
My father addressed himself to the gentleman point- blank, and
---
It was very foolish of my father,
---
But whatever
 he thinks,. 
---
that he'll do, in season or out of season;
 and
---
, of course, he makes many enemies, not only among the absolutely
 vicious, but among the easy- going, who hate being bothered
---
He says

---
he glories in what happened, and
---
he would not wear himself out
---
now he is getting old, and

---
Clare's revived thoughts of
 his father prevented; and
---
his noticing her particularly
---
he said to her softly--

" And my question, Tessy?"


---
" O no-- no!" replied she with grave hopelessness, as one who had
 heard anew the turmoil of her own past in the allusion to Alec
 d'Urberville."
---
It seemed natural enough to him
 now.




---
His experience of women was great enough for him to be aware that
 the negative often meant nothing more than the preface to the
 affirmative; and
---
it was little enough for him not to know that in
 the manner of the present negative there lay a great exception to
 the dallyings of coyness. 
---
he read as an additional assurance
---
" he asked her in
 the course of a few days.


---
" Indeed, you mistake them-- my father and mother. 
---
He clasped his fingers behind her back. 
---
Clare regarded her attentively,. 
---
Honestly, Tess, do you love any other man?"


---
" But you will not accept me as a husband?"


---
At such times as this, apprehending the grounds of her refusal to be
 her modest sense of incompetence in matters social and polite, he
 would say fragments
 of his knowledge, to a surprising extent. 
---
her natural quickness and her admiration for him
 having led her, his accent, and
---
; her own heart was so strongly on the
 side of his--
---
" Why do n't somebody tell him all about me?
---
; nobody told him.


---
Mr Crick, as well as his wife, seemed latterly; but of the faintest.
---
who was filling the vats with his handful
---
Angel,, suddenly ceased,
 and. 
---
lower he kissed the inside vein of her soft
 arm.


---
Truth is truth between man and woman,
---
they beamed devotedly into his.

"
---
?" he said.


---
he went on,".

---
And yet,
 dearest," he quickly added,.

---
Clare was so pained and perplexed that he
 ran after and caught her in the passage.


---
" Tell me, tell me!" he said,!"


---
He expressed
 assent in loving satire,. 
---
Reckless, inconsiderate acceptance of him; to close with him at the
 altar, revealing nothing, and chancing discovery; to snatch ripe
 pleasure before the iron teeth of pain could have time to shut upon
 her
---
Angel looked thoughtfully
 at her from a distance, but. 
---
myself marry
 him
---
anybody have him but me
---
Yet it is a wrong to him, and
---
when he knows
---
as he sat down to breakfast next day, with a riddling
 gaze round upon the munching men and maids
---
He's lately got."

"
---
The name entered quickly into Tess Durbeyfield's consciousness, for

---
it was the name of the lover who had wronged his sweetheart, and.

"
---
And had he married the valiant matron's daughter,?"

---
as he promised
---
as he turned over the newspaper
---
he was

---
to which he was always banished by Mrs
 Crick, in her sense of his gentility
---
that was all he was after. 
---
that the ghost of
 her first man would trouble him
---
He glanced towards the row of girls.

"
---
when he
 could hardly have backed out
---
what he was after
---
if he'd said two words to me
 about not telling him beforehand anything whatsomdever about my first
 chap that I had n't chose to tell
---
, I'd ha' knocked him down wi' the
 rolling- pin-- a scram little feller like he! 
---
Men had been cutting the water- weeds higher up
 the river, and
---
Clare sprang across the gully,
. 
---
Not expecting this, he had put his arm lightly round her waist the
 moment after speaking, beneath her hanging tail of hair. 
---
; it had evidently been his intention; but

---
her determined negative deterred his scrupulous heart. 
---
as the woman, to such
 disadvantage by its enforced intercourse, that he felt it unfair to
 her
---
which he might have

---
He released
 her momentarily- imprisoned waist, and.


---
to refuse
 him this time was solely the tale of the widow told by the dairyman;
 and. 
---
But Angel said
 no more;
---
his face was perplexed
---
; he went away.


---
that he might ask her again
---
His plan of procedure was different now--. 
---
as though he had made up
 his mind
---
So he played a more coaxing game; and
---
while never going beyond
 words, or attempting the renewal of caresses, he did his utmost
 orally.


---
In this way Clare persistently wooed her in undertones like that of
 the purling milk-- at the cow's side, at skimmings, at butter- makings,
 at cheese- makings, among broody poultry, and among farrowing pigs--.


---
as
 no milkmaid was ever wooed before by such a man
---
he was so godlike in her eyes; and. 
---
being, though
 untrained, instinctively refined, her nature cried for his tutelary
 guidance
---
And thus, repeating to herself," I can
 never be his wife,". 
---
Every sound of his voice beginning on the old
 subject stirred her with a terrifying bliss, and
---
His manner was--
---
a fresh renewal
 of Clare's pleading occurred one morning between three and four.


---
At the same moment he came down his steps from above in his
 shirt- sleeves and.


---
," he said peremptorily.
---
Clare had resolved; but
---
until he had obtained her
 promise
---
should be leisure to arrange it when skimming and milking were done,
 he broke his resolve, and
---
he
 musingly observed to her,.


---
as he regarded the three figures tripping
 before him through the frigid pallor of opening day
---
Dairyman Crick,, his wrapper gleaming
 miraculously white against a leaden evening sky, suddenly looked
 at his heavy watch.

"
---
," he said. 
---
Mr Clare volunteered,. 
---
though it was none of his business,

---
Clare gently urged her. 
---
Every now and then Angel would
 fling the lash of his whip round one of these,.


---
"," said he. 
---
," he said. 
---
he wrapped. 
---
Clare's hands being occupied
---
that he could hear for a little while
---
He said no more then. 
---
," he observed,,
---
The light of the engine flashed for a second upon Tess
 Durbeyfield's figure, motionless under the great holly tree. 
---
; father was not very
 industrious, and
---
he drank a little."


---
He pressed her more closely
 to his side.


---
" I-- I-- am not a Durbeyfield, but a d'Urberville-- a descendant of the
 same family as those that owned the old house we passed. 
---
He laughed.


---
that many of the hills and fields belonged to
 my father's people
---
that I did not see the resemblance of
 your name to d'Urberville, and
---
" Of course," continued the unwitting Clare," I should have been glad
 to know you to be descended exclusively from the long- suffering,
 dumb, unrecorded rank and file of the English nation, and not from
 the self- seeking few who made themselves powerful at the expense of
 the rest. 
---
( he laughed), and. 
---
as he spoke
---
Why, he is the
 very man who had that rumpus with my father I told you of. 
---
He clasped her close and.


---
he was surprised.


---
me to be your husband
---
for the first time Clare learnt
---
what an
 impassioned woman's kisses were like upon the lips of one whom she
 loved with all her heart and soul, as Tess loved him
---
as he would
---
quite private but very
    strong, that on no account do you say a word of your
    Bygone Trouble to him. 
---
J did not tell everything
    to your Father. 
---
, he being so Proud on account of his
    Respectability,
---
J have not named
    either that Question or your coming marriage to your
    Father, as he would blab it everywhere, poor Simple
    Man.

   
---
how light was the touch of events the most
 oppressive upon Mrs Durbeyfield's elastic spirit
---
There was hardly a touch of earth in her love for Clare. 
---
To her
 sublime trustfulness he was
---
The wisdom
 of her love for him, as love, sustained her dignity
---
The compassion of his love for her,,
 made. 
---
He would sometimes
 catch her large, worshipful eyes,.


---
that men could be so disinterested, chivalrous,
 protective, in their love for women as he
---
Angel Clare was far from
 all that she thought him in this respect; absurdly far, indeed;
 but
---
he was, in truth, more spiritual than animal
---
; he had himself
 well in hand, and. 
---
Though not
 cold- natured, he was rather bright than hot-- less Byronic than
 Shelleyan; but with a love more especially
 inclined to the imaginative and ethereal
---
; it was a fastidious emotion
 which could jealously guard the loved one against his very self.

---
which attracts men in general
---
; though it seemed oddly anticipative to Clare
---
till he
 saw how normal a thing she, in common with all the other dairy- folk
---
that the shadows of Clare and Tess
 would stretch a quarter of a mile ahead of them, like two long
 fingers pointing afar to where the green alluvial reaches abutted
 against the sloping sides of the vale
---
Men were at work here and there--.

---
Clare hardily kept his arm round her waist in sight of these
 watermen, with the air of a man who was accustomed to public
 dalliance, though actually as shy as she who, with lips parted and
 eyes askance on the labourers, wore the look of a wary animal the
 while.


---
where it
 rested like crystals, and on his brows and hair
---
to hear the words discoursed;
 noted the spasmodic catch in her remarks,, leaning on his arm; her
 contented pauses, the occasional little laugh to ride-- the laugh of a woman in company with the man has won from all other women-- unlike anything else in
 nature. 
---
Her affection for him was now the breath and life of Tess's being
---
how strange that he should have cited them now
---
Angel began,.

"
---
how careful he would
 have
---
" he said. 
---
He sat on by the cheerful firelight
---
he said,. 
---
good- humouredly, as he spread a cushion for her on the
 stool, and
---
her head to find a resting- place against Clare's
 shoulder
---
"

 He drew her gently.


---
if I sat so close to him
---
He continued to his wife, with the stolid
 mien of a man who understood nothing of the emotions relating to
 matrimony--"Now, Christianer,
---
" to be married soon," said Clare, with improvised
 phlegm.


---
-- I said so the very first day I zid her-- and a prize for
 any man; and
---
, a wonderful woman for a gentleman- farmer's
 wife; he wo n't be at the mercy of his baily wi' her at his side."


---
He's going!"
---
" I was on'y feeling
 all the strangeness o't-- that she is to be his wife, and nobody else.

---
" He ought
---
" He ought!
---
You would be better for him than--
---
especially since he had taught' ee so much
---
when you be his wife, Tess, and of how we told
' ee that we loved him, and how we tried not to hate you, and did not
 hate you, and could not hate you,
---
because you were his choice, and

---
to be chose by him
---
They were not aware that, at these words, salt, stinging tears
 trickled down upon Tess's pillow anew, and how she resolved, with a
 bursting heart, to tell all her history to Angel Clare, despite her
 mother's command-- to let him for whom she lived and breathed despise
 her if he would, and her mother regard her as a fool, rather then
 preserve a silence which might be deemed a treachery to him, and
 which somehow seemed a wrong to these.




---
though he
 asked her at the most tempting times
---
In the presence of these things
 he would remind her.


---
Or he would ask her at night,. 
---
when he accompanied her on some mission
 invented by Mrs Crick
---
Clare was
---
Did Crick speak to you to- day, dear, about his not wanting much
 assistance during the winter months?"


---
that he would no longer require you
---
But,
 knowing, he said in the most good- natured
 and respectful manner possible. 
---
that he supposed on my leaving at
 Christmas
---
what he would
 do without you
---
on he merely observed
---
that, as a matter of fact, it was a
 time of year when he could do with a very little female help
---
I am
 afraid I was sinner enough to feel rather glad that he was in this
 way forcing your hand."


---
you ought Angel
---
He put his finger
 upon her cheek. " Ah!
---
" he said.


---
where Angel Clare was
---
though
 he had thought of dismissing her soon
---
What should he do about his skimming? 
---
who was no
 common outdoor man
---
which might be accepted with
 a light heart by a rougher man
---
A post- nuptial explanation,, might not be received with the same
 feeling by him. 
---
But this communication brought no reply from Mrs
 Durbeyfield.


---
Despite Angel Clare's plausible representation to himself and to Tess
 of the practical need for their immediate marriage, there was in
 truth an element of precipitancy in the step,. 
---
He loved her dearly, though perhaps rather ideally and
 fancifully than with the impassioned thoroughness of her feeling for
 him. 
---
He had entertained no notion,,. 
---
as he had thought to
 an unintellectual bucolic life
---
as he beheld in this
 idyllic creature
---
he had not known. 
---
until he came here
---
Yet he was very far from seeing his future track
 clearly, and
---
before he would be able to
 consider himself fairly started in life
---
The secret lay in the tinge
 of recklessness imparted to his career and character by the sense
 that he had been made to miss his true destiny through the prejudices
 of his family.


---
His influence over her
 had been so marked. 
---
He wished.

---
His parents had naturally desired
---
once at least before he
 carried her off to a distant settlement, English or colonial; and
 as no opinion of theirs
---
,
 he judged.


---
that a couple of months' life with him in lodgings
 whilst seeking for an advantageous opening would be of some social
 assistance to her at what she might feel to be a trying ordeal-- her
 presentation to his mother at the Vicarage
---
Next, he wished. 
---
that he might combine the use of one with
 corn- growing
---
The proprietor of a large old water- mill at
 Wellbridge-- once the mill of an Abbey-- had offered him the inspection
 of his time- honoured mode of procedure, and
---
a hand in the operations
 for a few days, whenever he should choose. 
---
Clare paid a
 visit to the place, some few miles distant, one day at this time,
, and.

---
And what had determined him? 
---
how Clare settled practical questions; by
 a sentiment which had nothing to do with them
---
to examine some farms on the other side of
 London," he said,".
---
and by March or April we will
 pay a visit to my father and mother
---
Perhaps he had forgotten! 
---
Mrs Crick assumed a matron's privilege
 of speaking to Angel on the point.

"
---
," says Clare.


---
as he caught Tess alone
---
As soon he assured her:

". 
---
whether he would like her
, or
---
The question was set at rest by his forethought.

---
He entered the house shortly after
 the arrival of the packages, and.


---
XXXIII


 Angel felt; a romantic day,
 in circumstances that would never be repeated; with that other and
 greater day beaming close ahead of them. 
---
that he would like
---
During the preceding week,
 therefore, he suggested and
---
Clare's life at the dairy had been that of a recluse in respect the
 world of his own class. 
---
For months he had never gone near a town,
 and,,. 
---
if he rode or
---
In the evening they returned to the inn at which they had put up, and
 Tess waited in the entry while Angel went to see the horse and gig
 brought to the door. 
---
Two men came out and. 
---
he was a Trantridge man,
---
And he
 negatived the remainder of the definition forthwith.


---
Clare had just returned from the stable- yard, and,. 
---
The insult to her stung him to the quick, and
---
he had

---
before considered anything at all he struck the man on the chin with the
 full force of his fist,.


---
The man recovered himself, and
---
Clare,
 stepping outside the door, put himself in a posture of defence. 
---
But
 his opponent began. 
---
He looked anew at
 Tess, and. 
---
as he passed her
---
that he had been too hasty, and
---
that he was,
 moreover,
---
what he usually did in such cases
---
as Clare had taken the reins from the ostler,
 and
---
, the two men went in the other
 direction.

"
---
he asked good- humouredly.

"
---
he directed her. 
---
Clare ascended to
 his attic. 
---
in her
 anxiety lest Clare should be.

" Oh, nothing, dear
---
knocked at his door,
 and asked him," he said from within. 
---
Declare the past to him by word of mouth;
 but there was another way. 
---
; he descended, as
 usual. 
---
He met her at the bottom of the stairs and
.
---
He looked a little disturbed and worn
---
But he said not
 a word to her about her revelation, even when they were alone. 
---
Could
 he have had it? 
---
Unless he began the subject
---
that whatever
 he thought
---
he meant
---
Yet he was frank and
 affectionate as before. 
---
that he forgave her
---
; that he loved her for what she was,, and
---
Had he
 really received her note? 
---
that he forgave her
---
if he had

---
that he surely
 would forgive her
---
Every morning and night he was the same, and
---
As for Angel's family, he had

---
that he
 would be glad to see one at least of them there for the day if he
 would like to come
---
His brothers had not replied at all,.


---
; while his father and mother had written
 a rather sad letter,
---
that,,
 their son had arrived at an age which he might be supposed to be the
 best judge
---
had he been without the grand card with which he meant to
 surprise them ere long
---
To produce Tess, fresh from the dairy, as
 a d'Urberville and a lady, he had felt.

---
;
 hence he had concealed her lineage till such time
---
as, familiarized
 with worldly ways by a few months' travel and reading with him
---
, he
 could take her on a visit to his parents and
---
Perhaps Tess's lineage
 had more value for himself than for anybody in the world beside.


---
that Angel's bearing towards her still remained in no
 whit Tess guiltily doubtful

---
if he could have received it
---
before he had

---
which had been Clare's den, or rather
 eyrie, for so long, and
---
him read it now
---
when he saw her again
---
that he felt quite anxious
---
The only minute to be alone with Clare was.


---
"!" he cried. 
---
Those words of his seemed.

---
The postilion was a venerable" boy" of
 sixty-- a martyr to rheumatic gout, the result of excessive exposure
 in youth. 
---
since he had
---
He had a permanent
 running wound on the outside of his right leg, originated by the
 constant bruisings of aristocratic carriage- poles during the many
 years that he had been in regular employ at the King's Arms,
 Casterbridge.


---
Angel would have liked one at least
 of his brothers, but
---
their silence after
 his gentle hint to that effect by letter had signified. 
---
that Angel was close to her
---
Clare was
 accustomed to talk to her about.


---
so that her shoulder
 touched his arm
---
that he was really
 there,
---
that his fidelity would be proof
 against all things
---
Clare knew; what long- suffering it guaranteed,
 what honesty, what endurance, what good faith.


---
he did not know at that time the full depth of her devotion, its
 single- mindedness, its meekness
---
glorified by an irradiation
 not her own, like the angel whom St John saw in the sun
---
"," said Clare.


---
A certain
 d'Urberville of the sixteenth or seventeenth century committed a
 dreadful crime in his family coach; and whenever--
---
He silenced her by a kiss.


---
it was her
 husband who really had her supplication. 
---
Her idolatry of this man
 was such that she herself almost feared it to be ill- omened. 
---
at which he meant
---
All the servantry of the dairy were
 standing in the red- brick entry, the dairyman and
 his wife. 
---
Clare had not the least objection to such a farewell formality-- which
 was all that it was to him-- and
---
as he passed them
---
he kissed them in
 succession where they stood,.

---
as he did so
---
Of all this Clare was unconscious. 
---
Passing on to the wicket- gate he
 shook hands with the dairyman and his wife, and
---
expressed his last
 thanks to them for their attentions; after which there was a moment
 of silence. 
---
, within a few yards of
 them, and his notes thrilled their ears through,.


---
Two men were standing by the yard gate,.


---
to his wife as they went indoors
---
I've not heard his crow of an afternoon all the year
 afore."


---
wherein they
 had engaged lodgings, once portion of a fine
 manorial residence, and the property and seat of a d'Urberville, but
 since its partial demolition a farmhouse
---
" Welcome to one of your ancestral mansions!" said Clare. 
---
as he handed
 her down
---
But he regretted the pleasantry
---
But he found. 
---
that the mouldy old habitation somewhat depressed his
 bride
---
" said he.


---
He looked up, and. 
---
He said nothing of this, however, and,
. 
---
that he had gone out of his way
---
Clare touched hers under the water.

"
---
?" he said,.

---
He had not been displeased with her
 thoughtfulness on such an occasion
---
, that he found it interesting to use the
 same bread- and- butter plate as herself, and to brush crumbs from her
 lips with his own
---
He wondered a little that she did not enter into
 these frivolities with his own zest.


---
he thought to himself, as one deciding on the true construction of
 a difficult passage. 
---
to change," said Clare.


---
," continued Angel,, and at the grease guttering down the sides. 
---
He knew, and
---
Ah, there he is!"


---
, Clare went out. 
---
He returned to the room with a small package in
 his hand.


---
", after all," he said.


---
Clare
 brought it to the light. 
---
he, handing it
 to her
---
He undid the parcel. 
---
The note was for Clare, in the following words:


    MY DEAR SON--

   
---
"," said Clare;" but."


---
He looked into the fire. 
---
He remembered
---
when he was a lad of
 fifteen
---
with whom he had ever come in contact
---
how,, his godmother, the Squire's wife-- the only rich person
-- had pinned her faith to his
 success
---
There had seemed
 nothing at all out of keeping with such a conjectured career in the
 storing up of these showy ornaments for his wife and the wives of
 her descendants. 
---
he asked himself. 
---
Suddenly he said with enthusiasm--

!" 
---
And he turned from the fire.


---
," said Clare. 
---
" Yes," said he.


---
He suggested to her how to tuck in the upper edge of her bodice, so
 as to make it roughly approximate to the cut for evening wear; and

---
isolated
 amid the whiteness of her throat, to do, he
 stepped back.


---
" My heavens," said Clare,"!"


---
He had never till now estimated the artistic
 excellence of Tess's limbs and features.


---
" to appear in a ball- room!" he said. 
---
The ale poured out for his consumption.


---
when he came
---
as if
 some giant had laid his hand on the chimney- top for a moment
---
Angel went out.


---
for it was he at last;"
---
lines of concern were ploughed upon his
 forehead in addition to the lines of years. 
---
He continued--

". 
---
In the water he
 found her. 
---
He and another man brought her home,; but
---
him express his thanks for the ale
---
her husband took out to him,
 and for the gratuity he received
---
his cart creaked away.


---
Angel slid forward the massive oak bar which secured the door, and
,. 
---
He expected, but.


---
he sat down with her in the firelight,
---
"
 he said. 
---
This final determination, he holding her hand.


---
"?" he asked abruptly,. 
---
This, from him, so unexpectedly apposite, had the effect upon her of
 a Providential interposition.


---
He seemed. 
---
Clare went on--


---
My brother's Fellowship was won at his college, mine at
 Talbothays Dairy. 
---
my poor father fears
---
" The man of upright life, from frailties free,
    Stands not in need of Moorish spear or bow
---
He then told her of that time of his life to which allusion has been
 made.

"
---
, he plunged into eight- and- forty hours' dissipation
 with a stranger
---
," he
 continued. 
---
Imagination might have
 beheld a Last Day luridness in this red- coaled glow, which fell on
 his face and hand, and on hers,. 
---
when he had been kissing her; or rather,
 nothing in the substance of things
---
Clare performed the irrelevant act of stirring the fire
---
; the
 intelligence had not even yet got to the bottom of him. 
---
After
 stirring the embers he rose to his feet;
---
His face had withered. 
---
In the
 strenuousness of his concentration he treadled fitfully on the floor.

---
He could not, by any contrivance, think closely enough
---
; that was the
 meaning of his vague movement. 
---
When he spoke
---
it was in the most
 inadequate, commonplace voice of the many varied tones she had heard
 from him.


---
" And yet--"  He looked vacantly at her,:
"?
---
These and other of his words were nothing but the perfunctory babble
 of the surface. 
---
He turned away,
 and bent over a chair. 
---
where he was
---
as he did not answer
---
He paused,
---
He did not answer; and, sickly white
---
He shook his head.


---
He looked upon her as a species of
 imposter; a guilty woman in the guise of an innocent one. 
---
The horrible
 sense of his view of her so deadened her, and
---
he
 stepped forward,.


---
" Sit down, sit down," he said gently. 
---
It is not me, but another woman like me that he loved
---
",
 he says.
---
Clare was relieved at this change, for the effect on
---
He waited patiently, apathetically,
 till the violence of her grief and
---
" Angel," she said suddenly. "
---
that he was smothering his
 affection for her
---
that a tear descended slowly
 upon his cheek, a tear so large that it magnified the pores of the
 skin over which it rolled, like the object lens of a microscope
---
that her
 confession had wrought in his life
---
Meanwhile reillumination as to the terrible and total change, in his universe, returned to him,
 and
---
he tried desperately. 
---
in which
 he stood
---
He quietly left the room, and. 
---
that he had

---
the two glasses of wine poured out for their supper-- one for her, one for him--
---
The closing of the door behind him,, roused Tess from her stupor. 
---
He was gone
---
for Clare walked slowly and without
 purpose
---
His form beside her light gray figure looked black,
 sinister, and, and
---
Clare turned at
 hearing her footsteps, but
---
his recognition of her presence seemed
, and
---
he went on over the five yawning
 arches of the great bridge in front of the house.


---
At last, however, her listless walk brought her up alongside him, and

---
still he said nothing. 
---
it was mighty in Clare now. 
---
The outdoor air
 had apparently taken away from him all tendency to act on impulse
---
that he saw her without irradiation-- in all her bareness
---
;
 that Time was chanting his satiric psalm at her
---
Behold,, he shall hate
---
He was still intently thinking, and
---
What a
 weak thing her presence must have become to him! 
---
I knew
 nothing of men."


---
he did not answer
---
" O Angel-- my mother says. 
---
that it sometimes happens the husband has not
 minded it much--
---
if he had held his tongue
---
simply, not in their
 particulars; he did not love her to all else
---
as he had loved her hitherto, and

---
that he obtained of their faces
---
Returning later, he passed them again in the
 same field,. 
---
It was only on account of his
 preoccupation with his own affairs, and the illness in his house,
 that he did not bear in mind the curious incident, which, however, he
 recalled a long while after.


---
" to add murder to my other follies," he said.


---
Angel had put it there
---
whose contents he would not
 explain to her,. 
---
In his zest and his gaiety he had hung it there. 
---
that
 he would relent there
---
Later on that night Clare also retraced his steps to the house.

---
he obtained a light,
---
who had considered his course
---
Entering softly to the sitting- room and with the
 manner of one he spread his rugs upon
 the old horse- hair sofa which stood there, and. 
---
Before lying down he crept shoeless upstairs, and
. 
---
yet he was conscious of a pang of
 bitterness at the thought-- approximately true, though not wholly
 so.


---
-- that having shifted the burden of her life to his shoulders
---
He turned away; then, irresolute, faced round to her
 door again. 
---
In the act he caught sight of one of the d'Urberville
 dames
---
-- so it seemed to
 him then. 
---
when he tucked it in
---
again
 he experienced the distressing sensation of a resemblance between
 them.


---
He resumed his retreat and.


---
His air remained calm and cold.

---
, his small compressed mouth indexing
 his powers of self- control; his face wearing still that terrible
 sterile expression which had spread thereon since her disclosure
---
It was the face of a man who was no longer passion's slave, yet. 
---
who
 found no advantage in his enfranchisement
---
He was simply regarding
 the harrowing contingencies of human experience, the unexpectedness
 of things. 
---
all the long while that he had adored her, up to an hour
 ago
---
He argued erroneously but
---
when he said to himself
---
, he continued,
---
He reclined on his couch in the sitting- room, and. 
---
which had already swallowed up his
 happiness, and
---
XXXVI


 Clare arose in the light of a dawn that was ashy and furtive,. 
---
The fireplace confronted him with its
 extinct embers
---
; the spread supper- table, whereon stood the two full
 glasses of untasted wine, now flat and filmy; her vacated seat and
 his own; the other articles of furniture, with their eternal look of
 not being able to help it, their intolerable inquiry what was to be
 done? 
---
He remembered.


---
being already dressed, he opened the window
 and. 
---
which he told her
---
he searched in the back
 quarters of the house for fuel, and. 
---
Clare
 soon had. 
---
breakfast laid, his experiences at the dairy
---
Angel cast a final glance round, and
---
He opened the front door, and.

---
When, after a short space, he came back
---
the interval since his calling her had been
 but two or three minutes
---
or nearly so
 before he went
---
The marked civility of Clare's tone in calling her seemed. 
---
He spoke gently to her, and
---
that he gazed
 at her with a stupefied air
---
He looked at her imploringly,.
---
as if he would willingly have taken a
 lie from her lips,
---
" Is he living?"
---
Angel then asked.

"."


---
" He is alive."


---
A last despair passed over Clare's face.


---
" Is he in England?"


---
He took a few vague steps.


---
"," he said abruptly. 
---
any man would
 have thought--;

---
However, I am no man to reproach you, and
---
he had

---
"," he said.


---
" The courage to do what?"

 he took her by the hand.


---
"?" he inquired.


---
" he asked sternly.


---
But he still held her, and,

---
, he said, ". 
---
You will promise me as your husband."


---
" But, Angel," she pleaded,
---
enlarging her eyes in calm unconcern upon
 him," it was thought of entirely on your account--. 
---
He knew this. 
---
Breakfast over, he rose, and.


---
at which he might
 be expected to dinner
---
which had been his
 only practical reason for coming here
---
When he was gone
---
his form
 crossing the great stone bridge which conducted to the mill premises
---
He sank behind it,.

---
he showed himself
---
although he was a
 quarter of a mile off
---
served by the time he should enter
---
He went first to the room where
 they had washed their hands together the day before, and as he
 entered the sitting- room the dish- covers rose from the dishes as if
 by his own motion.

"
---
How punctual!" he said.


---
The meal was passed in commonplace talk of what he had been doing
 during the morning at the Abbey Mill, of the methods of bolting and
 the old- fashioned machinery, which he feared would not enlighten him
 greatly on modern improved methods, some of it seeming to have been
 in use ever since the days it ground for the monks in the adjoining
 conventual buildings-- now a heap of ruins. 
---
He left the house again
 in the course of an hour,. 
---
Clare's shape appeared at the door.
---
"," he
 said. 
---
It would almost
 have won round any man but Angel Clare. 
---
as he was in general
---
It had blocked his acceptance of the Church
---
; it blocked
 his acceptance of Tess. 
---
Moreover, his affection itself was less fire
 than radiance, and, with regard to the other sex,. 
---
when he ceased

---
he ceased
---
He waited.


---
"," he
 said, in an ebullition of bitterness against womankind in general.

---
He spoke such things as these and more of a kindred sort to her,
. 
---
, a back current of
 sympathy through which a woman of the world might have conquered him.

---
The firmness of her devotion to him was
 indeed almost pitiful
---
It was on the third occasion of his starting after a meal
. 
---
As he was leaving the table
---
he said
" Goodbye," and
---
He did not avail himself of
 the invitation,
---
as he turned hastily
---
Often enough had
 he tried--
---
to reach those lips against her consent often had he said
 gaily. 
---
that, that he drew sustenance
 from them, and other follies of that sort
---
But he did not care for
 them now. 
---
He observed her sudden shrinking, and
---
He went out, and
---
that he had responded yet more kindly, and
---
that he was,
---
as he had said,
---
His consistency was, indeed, too cruel. 
---
that this,
 instead of benefiting him, might be the means of hampering and
 humiliating him yet more
---
Meanwhile Clare was meditating, verily. 
---
His thought had been
 unsuspended
---
; he was becoming ill with thinking. 
---
He walked about saying to himself,
". 
---
" I can not" he said," without despising myself, and. 
---
while that man lives?--he
 being your husband in nature, and
---
If he were dead
---
Tess's feminine hope-- continued long enough to break down his coldness
 even against his judgement. 
---
His last representation had now been made, and
---
his
 lucid picture of possible offspring her was one that
 brought deadly convictions to an honest heart which was humanitarian
 to its centre. 
---
But with the
 self- combating proclivity of the supersensitive, an answer thereto
 arose in Clare's own mind, and
---
he almost feared it. 
---
reproaches were not likely to be addressed to him or to his by
 strangers
---
its husband's, and, they might have reached his ears from his own fastidious
 brain.


---
that with more animalism he would have been the nobler man
---
Yet Clare's love was doubtless ethereal to a
 fault, imaginative to impracticability. 
---
Clare had not thought of that.


---
"?" he inquired.


---
to go home?" he asked.


---
He was pale, even tremulous;
 but, as before. 
---
as dead
 leaves upon the tyrannous wind of his imaginative ascendency
---
He may have observed for he explained--


---
That day he began, and
---
He knew,
 and
---
the figure of her husband crossed the
 stream of moonlight with a curiously careful tread. 
---
He was in his
 shirt and trousers only, and
---
that his eyes were fixed in an unnatural stare on vacancy
---
When he reached the middle of the room
---
he stood still and!
---
Under the influence of any strongly- disturbing force, Clare would
 occasionally walk in his sleep, and. 
---
such
 as he had done on the night of their return from market
---
just before
 their marriage, when he re- enacted in his bedroom his combat with the
 man who had insulted her
---
that continued mental distress
 had wrought him into that somnambulistic state now
---
Her loyal confidence in him lay so deep down in her heart,. 
---
that,
 awake or asleep, he inspired her with no sort of personal fear
---
If
 he had entered with a pistol in his hand
---
he would scarcely have

---
Clare came close, and bent over her.
---
" Dead, dead, dead!" he murmured.


---
After fixedly regarding her for some moments with the same gaze of
 unmeasurable woe, he bent lower,. 
---
Then lifting her from the bed with
 as much respect, he carried her
 across the room, murmuring--


---
The words of endearment, withheld so severely in his waking hours,
 were inexpressibly sweet to her forlorn and hungry heart. 
---
what he was going
---
" My wife-- dead, dead!" he said.


---
He paused in his labours for a moment. 
---
Was he going? 
---
that he had planned
---
However, he did not let, but. 
---
Then he clasped her with a renewed firmness of hold, and
. 
---
The creak of the loose stair did not awaken
 him, and
---
Freeing one of his
 hands from his grasp of her for a moment, he slid back the door- bar
 and. 
---
But this he seemed, and,
---
having room for
 extension in the open air, he lifted her against his shoulder,. 
---
so
 that he could carry her with ease,
---
the absence of clothes taking much
 from his burden
---
Thus he bore her off the premises in the direction
 of the river a few yards distant.


---
if he had any
---
His ultimate intention,, she had not yet divined; and
. 
---
her whole being up to him

---
he was regarding her as his absolute
 possession
---
as he should choose
---
that he
 really recognized her now as his wife Tess, and
---
even if in that recognition he went so far as to arrogate to himself
 the right of harming her
---
what he was dreaming of--
---
when he
 had borne her along through the water with the other dairymaids, who
 had loved him nearly as much
---
Clare did not cross the bridge with her,
 but.


---
Opposite the spot to
 which he had brought her
---
Her husband had

---
possibly observed the same performance; anyhow, he now mounted the
 plank, and,.


---
Was he going? 
---
Probably he was. 
---
He might drown her
---
if he would
---
there would be no more
 reproach to her, or to him for marrying her. 
---
His last half- hour with
 her would have been a loving one,
---
till he awoke
---
,
 his day- time aversion would return, and
---
He reached the other side with her in safety.


---
he went onward a few steps. 
---
Against the north wall
 was the empty stone coffin of an abbot, in which every tourist with
 a turn for grim humour was accustomed to stretch himself. 
---
he
 breathed deeply
---
Clare
 then lay down on the ground alongside,. 
---
when he immediately fell into
 the deep dead slumber of exhaustion, and
---
The night, though dry and mild for the
 season, was more than sufficiently cold to make it dangerous for him
 to remain here long, in his half- clothed state. 
---
If he were left to
 himself
---
he would in all probability stay there till the morning, and
. 
---
him
 know
---
what he had been doing
---
when it would mortify him
---
To her relief, he unresistingly acquiesced
---
; her words
 had apparently thrown him back into his dream
---
wherein he fancied and
---
Clare was in
 his woollen stockings, and.


---
But the exhaustion of his mind and body was such that he remained
 undisturbed.


---
that Angel knew

---
, though, as regarded himself, he may have been aware that
 he had not lain still
---
In truth, he had awakened that morning from
 a sleep deep as annihilation; and
---
in which the brain, like a Samson shaking himself
---
, he had some dim notion of an unusual nocturnal proceeding.

---
But the realities of his situation soon displaced conjecture on the
 other subject.


---
He waited in expectancy
---
to discern some mental pointing; he knew
---
if any intention of his, concluded over- night
---
He thus beheld in the pale morning
 light the resolve to separate from her
---
Clare no longer hesitated.


---
At breakfast, and,
 he showed his weariness from the night's effort so unmistakeably that
 Tess was on the point of revealing all that had happened; but. 
---
the
 reflection that it would anger him,
---
that he had instinctively manifested a fondness for her of which his
 common- sense did not approve
---
, that his inclination had compromised
 his dignity
---
It was too much
 like laughing at a man when sober for his erratic deeds during
 intoxication.


---
that he might have a faint
 recollection of his tender vagary, and
---
it gave her of appealing to him anew not to go
---
He had ordered by letter a vehicle from the nearest town, and
. 
---
the man drove
 them off, the miller and the old waiting- woman expressing some
 surprise at their precipitate departure, which Clare attributed to
 his discovery that the mill- work was not of the modern kind which he
 wished to investigate, a statement that was true so far as it went.

---
as Clare wished
---
they could see over the stumps the spot to which Clare had
 followed her when he pressed her to be his wife; to the left the
 enclosure in which she had been fascinated by his harp; and
---
her father's, and Marian had left. 
---
, as if united body and
 soul, there would have been something peculiarly sorry in their
 aspect to one who should have seen it truly; two limbs of one life,
 as they outwardly were, his arm touching hers, her skirts touching
 him, facing one way, as against all the dairy facing the other,
 speaking in their adieux as" we", and yet sundered like the poles.

---
till they reached the Lane inn, where
 Clare dismissed the fly and man
---
At a midway point,, Clare
 stopped the conveyance and. 
---
that he would leave her
---
he asked her
---
directing the man to wait a few minutes they
 strolled away.

"
---
Now, let," he said gently. 
---
; he could regard her in no other light than that
 of one who had practised gross deceit upon him. 
---
with which he was

---
fainted, wept hysterically, in that lonely lane,
 notwithstanding the fury of fastidiousness possessed, he would probably not have withstood her. 
---
But her mood
 of long- suffering made his way easy for him, and
---
He
 now handed her a packet containing a fairly good sum of money, which
 he had obtained from his bankers for the purpose. 
---
if he
 understood the wording of the will
---
(), he advised her; and.


---
him send
 to a bank for safety
---
, he walked with Tess back to the carriage,
 and. 
---
he had

---
Taking next his own bag and umbrella-- the sole articles brought with him hitherwards
---
-- he bade her goodbye; and
---
Clare watched. 
---
Thus he beheld her recede,
 and
---
It was thrown open by a stranger, not by the old man who
 had kept it for many years, and. 
---
to; he had

---
" Oh-- nothing, miss," he answered. 
---
John Durbeyfield, too, hev had a daughter
 married this week to a gentleman- farmer
---
; not from John's own house,
 you know
---
that John's own folk was not considered
---
that John is a old and ancient nobleman
 himself by blood, with family skillentons in their own vaults to
 this day,
---
However, Sir John,, kept up the wedding- day as well
 as he could, and."


---
that he had been called away on business, and,

---
Then where's thy husband?"


---
Oh, he's gone away for a time."


---
and he gone away?"


---
" Yes, he's gone."


---
But I did tell him--
---
he went away!"


---
He was so good-- and
---
I felt
 the wickedness of trying to blind him as to what had happened!

---
he could get
 rid o' me by law if he were determined not to overlook it
---
how I loved him--
---
how wrung I was between caring so much for him
 and my wish to be fair to him
---
I'm sure I do n't know why
 children o' my bringing forth should all be bigger simpletons than
 other people's-- not to know better than to blab such a thing as
 that, when he could n't ha' found it out till too late!" 
---
Here Mrs
 Durbeyfield began. 
---
What your father will say
---
for he's been talking about the wedding up at Rolliver's and
---
The
 Pure Drop every day since, and about his family getting back to their
 rightful position through you-- poor silly man!--and
---
"

 As if to bring matters to a focus, Tess's father was heard
 at that moment. 
---
He did not, however, enter immediately,
 and
---
Mrs Durbeyfield said. 
---
Presently her father entered,. 
---
He was a foot- haggler now,, and
---
he travelled with his basket on his arm. 
---
that he was in his work
---
about--" Durbeyfield began, and
---
originated by the fact of his daughter having
 married into a clerical family
---
They was formerly styled' sir',
 like my own ancestry
---
"," he said,"." 
---
, he had mentioned no
 particulars. 
---
He hoped. 
---
He
 proposed. 
---
He asked.


---
Then Mrs Durbeyfield informed him but
---
When at length the collapse was explained to him
---
, a sullen
 mortification, not usual with Durbeyfield, overpowered the influence
 of the cheering glass. 
---
Yet the intrinsic quality of the event moved
 his touchy sensitiveness less than its conjectured effect upon the
 minds of others.

"
---
To think, now, to be the end o't!" said Sir John.

---
him keep her if he's married
 her
---
he really have married
---
if her
 father doubted her a little
---
that he had gone to the North of England
---
which had arisen
 between the young husband and wife
---
that Clare found
---
himself
 descending the hill which led to the well- known parsonage of his
 father
---
With his downward course the tower of the church rose into
 the evening sky in a manner of inquiry as to why he had come; and
---
He was arriving like a ghost, and
---
the sound of his
 own footsteps was almost an encumbrance to be got rid of.


---
The picture of life had changed for him. 
---
Before this time he had

---
known it but speculatively; now he thought
---
he knew it as a practical
 man
---
; though perhaps he did not, even yet. 
---
Nevertheless humanity
 stood before him no longer in the pensive sweetness of Italian art,
 but in the staring and ghastly attitudes of a Wiertz Museum, and with
 the leer of a study by Van Beers.


---
His conduct during these first weeks had been desultory beyond
 description. 
---
as though nothing unusual had happened, in
 the manner recommended by the great and wise men of all ages
---
After mechanically attempting to pursue his
 agricultural plans, he
 concluded.

---
that very few of those great and wise men had ever gone so
 far outside themselves
---
That was just Clare's own opinion. 
---
But he was. 
---
Clare chimed in cordially; but
---
his heart was troubled all the same.

---
How he would have liked, and
!


---
His mood transmuted itself into a dogged indifference till at length

---
he fancied.


---
he was looking on his own existence with the passive
 interest of an outsider
---
He was embittered by the conviction that all this desolation had been
 brought about by the accident of her being a d'Urberville. 
---
When he
 found
---
as he had fondly dreamed
---
was not of
 the new tribes from below,, why had he not
 stoically abandoned her in fidelity to his principles? 
---
what
 he had got by apostasy
---
his punishment was deserved.


---
Then he became weary and anxious, and
---
his anxiety increased. 
---
He
 wondered. 
---
if he had treated her unfairly
---
He ate without knowing that
 he ate, and. 
---
as the
 motive of each act in the long series of bygone days presented itself
 to his view
---
, he perceived.


---
In going hither and thither he observed in the outskirts of a small
 town a red- and- blue placard setting forth the great advantages of
 the Empire of Brazil as a field for the emigrating agriculturist.

---
Brazil
 somewhat attracted him as a new idea. 
---
In brief he was.


---
With this view he was returning to Emminster, and. 
---
he could make of
 arriving without Tess, short of revealing what had actually separated
 them
---
As he reached the door
---
when he
 had carried his wife in his arms across the river to the graveyard
 of the monks
---
his face was thinner now.


---
Clare had given his parents no warning of his visit, and
---
his arrival
 stirred the atmosphere of the Vicarage. 
---
His father and mother were both in the
 drawing- room, but
---
neither of his brothers was now at home. 
---
Angel
 entered, and.

"
---
his going to a Papistical
 land
---
But even the novelty and painfulness of could not displace for long Mr and Mrs Clare's natural interest
 in their son's marriage.


---
" your brief note announcing," said Mrs Clare," and
---
your father sent your godmother's gift
 to her,. 
---
I could have seen her first, Angel, or
---
He replied.


---
whilst he came there
---
" telling you, dear mother," he said,". 
---
He was afraid they would not. 
---
His original plan had been, and
---
as he had

---
for other
 reasons he had adhered to it. 
---
He would have
---
if he went out at once; and
---
before he started a second time
---
Clare made further
 exposition of his plans. 
---
His mother's disappointment at not seeing
 the bride still remained with her. 
---
Clare's late enthusiasm for Tess
 had infected her through her maternal sympathies,.
---
as he ate
---
"!" he said, with a zest which
 covered its bitterness.


---
to
 be an agriculturist, it is perhaps but proper that his wife should
 have been accustomed to an outdoor life
---
His father was less inquisitive; but
---
since Angel has come
---
" Yes, certainly," said Mrs Clare. 
---
" My dear son,
 your father has decided. 
---
A lump rose in Clare's throat. 
---
Angel's father began
---
he praiseth her. 
---
"


 When prayers were over, his mother said--


---
your dear
 father read
---
Clare could bear this no longer. 
---
His eyes were full of tears, which
 seemed like drops of molten lead. 
---
He bade a quick good night to
 these sincere and simple souls whom he loved so well;. 
---
He went to his own
 chamber.


---
Clare opened it.

" Angel
---
"," said he.


---
"," he said. 
---
"

" Angel-- is she a young woman
---
With a mother's instinct Mrs Clare had put her finger on the kind of
 trouble that would cause such a disquiet as seemed to agitate her
 son.


---
he replied; and.

"
---
that if it had sent him to
 eternal hell there and
---
then he would have told that lie
---
Such terrible sarcasm of blind magnanimity brought home to Clare the
 secondary perception that he had utterly wrecked his career by this
 marriage, which had not been among his early thoughts after the
 disclosure. 
---
True, on his own account he cared very little about his
 career; but. 
---
he had wished
---
as he looked into the
 candle
---
And now its flame dumbly expressed to him.


---
When his agitation had cooled
---
he would be at moments incensed with
 his poor wife for causing a situation in which he was obliged to
 practise deception on his parents. 
---
He almost talked to her in his
 anger,. 
---
the velvet touch
 of her lips passed over his brow, and
---
he could distinguish in the air
 the warmth of her breath
---
how
 great and good her husband was
---
which Angel Clare perceived,
---
With all his attempted independence of
 judgement this advanced and well- meaning young man, a sample product
 of the last five- and- twenty years, was yet the slave to custom and
 conventionality. 
---
No
 prophet had told him, and
---
he was not prophet enough to tell himself,
. 
---
In considering
, he overlooked and.




---
After breakfast Clare went into the little town, and
---
as he was concerned with there
---
to get from
 the local bank all the money he possessed. 
---
On his way back he
 encountered Miss Mercy Chant by the church, from whose walls
---
although, in the opinion of Angel, it was obtained
 by a curiously unnatural sacrifice of humanity to mysticism
---
that he was about to leave England,
---
he replied. "
---
Then Clare, in which a man does despite to his true principles,. 
---
he could think of
---
His momentary laughter at the horror ceased.


---
when it merged in pain and anxiety
 for his welfare
---
" Dear Mercy," he said,. 
---
that he was; and
---
Clare
 re- entered the Vicarage
---
With the local banker he deposited the
 jewels till happier days. 
---
He also paid into the bank
 thirty pounds-- to be sent to Tess in a few months,; and. 
---
what he had done
---
he had

---
He deemed it best; and,
---
being unaware of to estrange the two, neither his father nor his
 mother suggested. 
---
that he should do so
---
During the day he left the
 parsonage, for what he had to complete
---
he wished.


---
for him to call at the Wellbridge farmhouse
---
, in which he had spent
 with Tess the first three days of their marriage,. 
---
that the deepest shadow ever thrown
 upon his life
---
when he had

---
which returned first upon him
---
The farmer and his wife were in the field at the moment of his visit,
 and
---
Clare was in the rooms alone for some time. 
---
that he had not quite reckoned with
---
Inwardly swollen
 with a renewal of sentiment, he
 went upstairs to her chamber, which had never been his. 
---
just as he had placed
 it
---
Angel took it down and. 
---
Standing there, he for the first time doubted
. 
---
whether his course in this conjecture had been a wise, much less
 a generous, one
---
But had he not been cruelly blinded? 
---
In the
 incoherent multitude of his emotions he knelt down at the bedside
. 
---
he mourned.


---
Hearing a footstep below, he rose and.

---
At the bottom of the flight he saw and.

"
---
Mr Clare," she said,". 
---
who had not yet
 guessed his; an honest girl who loved him-- one who would have made as
 good, or nearly as good, a practical farmer's wife as Tess
---
"," he said;." 
---
why he had come
---
Explaining
, he asked,""


---
in which he was

---
He soon found the farmer, and. 
---
" to leave England, Izz," he said,.

---
" How?" he inquired. 
---
Her black eyes flashed up to his face for one moment by way of
 answer.


---
" Izz!--how weak of you-- for such as I!" he said, and. 
---
Clare slowed the horse. 
---
He was;
---
for they had cooped him up in a
 corner, out of which
---
"," said he. 
---
He drove past the cross- roads, one mile, two miles, without showing
 any signs of affection.


---
"?" he suddenly asked.


---
Clare was silent
---
; his heart had risen at these straightforward words
 from such an unexpected unimpeachable quarter. 
---
His ears repeated
---
" Forget our idle talk, Izz," he said,. 
---
he cried. 
---
He felt.

"
---
how richly he deserved the reproach that the wounded cry
 conveyed, and,
---
he was far from feeling
---
forcing
 himself to the mentor's part;" I want
---
that there are
 more worthy men
---
I send this message to them as a dying man to the dying
---
they are not so bad as men in
 these things! 
---
Goodbye!"

 He drove on; but
---
Clare
 was out of sight,; and
---
Clare, too, after bidding the girl farewell, was wrought to aching
 thoughts and quivering lips. 
---
But his sorrow was not for Izz. 
---
That
 evening he was within a feather- weight's turn of abandoning his road
 to the nearest station, and. 
---
which divided him from his Tess's home
---
It was
 neither a contempt for her nature, nor the probable state of her
 heart, which deterred him.


---
If he was right at first
---
,
 he was right now. 
---
on which he
 had embarked
---
He could soon come back to her. 
---
He took the train that
 night for London, and
---
us press on to
 an October day, more than eight months subsequent to the parting
 of Clare and Tess
---
that were projected by her husband for her comfort through
 this probationary period
---
-- he who, the moment to keep
 for her own, had disappeared like a shape in a vision.


---
which had remained to her of Clare's
 allowance, after deducting the other half of the fifty as a
 contribution to her parents for the trouble and expense to which
 she had put them
---
Angel had put them into her hand,

---
had obtained them bright and new from his bank for her; his touch had

---
consecrated them to souvenirs of himself-- they appeared
---
as yet no other history than such as was created by his and her own
 experiences-- and
---
As
 her husband was a man of means, and
---
, a remark of Angel's that she was,.


---
The same delicacy, pride, false shame called, on Clare's account, which had led her to hide from her own
 parents the prolongation of the estrangement,.

---
after the fair allowance he had left her
---
him
 know her state
---
with her husband's parents might
---
On they were under the impression that she
 was ultimately going to join her husband; and from that time to the
 present she had done nothing to disturb their belief that she was
 awaiting his return in comfort, hoping against hope that his journey
 to Brazil would result in a short stay only,
---
after which he would
 come or
---
that he would write
---
Where Clare had
 deposited them and
---
At this moment he was lying ill of fever in the clay lands near
 Curitiba in Brazil,.


---
her return might bring reproach upon
 her idolized husband. 
---
With the shortening of the days all hope of obtaining her husband's
 forgiveness began; and
---
Among the difficulties of her lonely position not the least was
 the attention she excited by her appearance, a certain bearing of
 distinction, which she had caught from Clare, being superadded to her
 natural attractiveness. 
---
because, for one thing, it was
 nearer to the home of her husband's father; and
---
He stepped up alongside Tess and
 said--


---
The man turned and.

"
---
though your fancy- man was so up about it-- hey, my sly one
---
Solomon had thought
 as far as that more than two thousand years ago
---
where several
 young men were troublesomely complimentary to her good looks
---
that her husband
 also might say these same things to her even yet
---
because Angel is not here, and
---
My husband is gone away, and
---
I love him just the same, and and
---
I was Mrs Angel Clare
---
" Well, well.  HE married you-- and
---
And he's none. 
---
My husband has gone abroad, and.

---
because he's away
---
if he were here,

---
even if he gie'd ye no money
---
-- even if he used you like a drudge
---
who
 represented him this evening
---
its cheapness made it profitable for tasks
 which women could perform as readily as men.


---
a letter should arrive at Marlott from her husband. 
---
it might have
 brought reproach upon him
---
that blending of moral courage with
 physical timidity, was now no longer a minor feature in Mrs Angel
 Clare
---
if not actually, her husband;
 but the irresistible fascination of the subject betrayed her into
 reciprocating Marian's remarks
---
I lost him
---
Then we could bring up Talbothays every day here
 afield, and talk of he, and of what nice times we had there, and o'
 the old things we used to know, and!" 
---
which had witnessed scenes of cataclysmal
 horror in inaccessible polar regions of a magnitude such as no human
 being had ever conceived, in curdling temperatures that no man could
 endure; which had beheld the crash of icebergs and the slide of
 snow- hills by the shooting light of the Aurora
---
Your husband, my dear, is. 
---
if he could only see his
 pretty wife now! 
---
You must n't talk about him to me, Marian
---
They did all kinds of men's work by preference,. 
---
When he had dismounted
---
he came close to
 Tess, and. 
---
his fixed attitude led her,
.


---
that her employer was the native of Trantridge
 from whom she had taken flight on the high- road because of his
 allusion to her history
---
He waited? 
---
when he said,
---
you had got the better
 of me the first time at the inn with your fancy- man,
---
He concluded with a hard laugh.


---
to know by this time; it was rather the
 tyranny induced by his mortification at Clare's treatment of him.

---
that sentiment in man and felt brave
 enough to endure it
---
He looked sullenly at her and. 
---
And so at last the conversation
 turned to their old experiences at the dairy; and, of course, the
 incidents of their affection for Angel Clare.


---
as I used, about Mr Clare
---
although he is gone away from me for
 the present
---
because,, he is my husband
---
He was a very splendid lover, no doubt
---
he is a too fond husband to go away from you
 so soon
---
He had
---
" to go-- he was obliged!
---
" He might have tided' ee over the winter."


---
Perhaps
 there's a good deal to be said for him! 
---
He did not go away, like
 some husbands, without telling me; and
---
where
 he is
---
"," he said to her.


---
," he said doggedly,.


---
as he crossed the barn and

---
Do n't' ee mind him, there's a dear
---
Her
 succumbing had been as largely owning to agitation at the re- opening
 the subject of her separation from her husband as to the hard work.

---
" I should not have thought it of him-- never!"
---
" And I loved him so! 
---
his having YOU
---
Is it about my husband
---
what he wanted
---
He wanted."


---
Anyhow he changed his mind."


---
" Pooh-- then he did n't mean it! '
---
Yes he did
---
; for he drove her a good- ways towards the station."


---
" He did n't take her!"


---
He said
---
I could not
 go to him, but
---
he did n't say.

---
I have been very wrong and
 neglectful in leaving everything to be done by him!"


---
It was through her husband's parents. 
---
But that sense of her having
 morally no claim upon him had always led Tess to the family at the Vicarage, therefore,
 as to her own parents. 
---
Why had her husband not written
 to her? 
---
He had distinctly implied but
---
that he would at least let her
 know of the locality to which he had journeyed;
---
he had not sent a
 line to notify his address. 
---
Was he really indifferent? 
---
But was he
 ill? 
---
If Angel's father were the good
 man
---
him represented
---
to be, he would be able to enter
 into her heart- starved situation. 
---
that
 the journey concerned her husband
---
' Tis a thousand pities your husband ca n't see' ee now
---
when momentarily tempted by Clare
---
that at that moment the
 Vicar and his congregation were gathered,
---
Such a good man might be prejudiced against a woman who
 had chosen Sunday,.

---
that his father always insisted upon
 the household
---
The pedestrians were his two brothers.

---
It was the woman who had been destined for
 Angel's life- companion by his and her parents, and whom he probably
 would have married but for her intrusive self. 
---
I never see that nice girl without more and more regretting his
 precipitancy in throwing himself away upon a dairymaid, or whatever
 she may be. 
---
when I heard from him
---
He never tells me anything nowadays. 
---
His
 ill- considered marriage seems."


---
which was begun by his extraordinary opinions
---
During their discourse one of the clerical brothers probed the hedge
 carefully with his umbrella, and.


---
"," he said. 
---
Cuthbert Clare,, picked them up for
 her with the crook of his stick; and
---
Innocently
, it was somewhat unfortunate that
 she had encountered the sons and not the father, who, despite his
 narrowness, was far less starched and ironed than they, and had to
 the full the gift of charity. 
---
HE bought for me
---
that HE chose the colour o' my pretty frock-- no-- how
 could they? 
---
for they do n't care much for him, poor thing
---
His voice became so distinct in the still clear air that she could
 soon catch his sentences,. 
---
for he
 had plainly no skill as a dialectician
---
how he had come by
 those views
---
He had
---
, he said,
---
He had

---
scoffed; he had wantonly associated with the reckless and the lewd.

---
brought about mainly by the influence of a certain clergyman, whom he
 had
---
whose parting words had sunk into
 his heart, and
---
they
 had worked this change in him, and
---
him what they saw him
---
;
, so that the rays stretched far in over
 the threshing- floor to the preacher and his audience,
---
The listeners were entirely
 villagers, among them being the man whom she had seen carrying the
 red paint- pot on a former memorable occasion. 
---
The three o'clock sun shone full
 upon him, and.



---
the strange enervating conviction ever since she
 had heard his words distinctly
---
though he stood there openly and palpably a
 converted man, who was sorrowing for his past irregularities,
---
now he wore neatly trimmed, old- fashioned whiskers,.


---
his dress was half- clerical,
 a modification which had changed his expression sufficiently to
 abstract the dandyism from his features, and
---
which
 his face had used
---
when his wishes were thwarted now
---
who would insist upon
 turning again to his wallowing in the mire
---
D'Urberville was not the first wicked man who had turned
 away from his wickedness to save his soul alive, and
---
He
 had obviously not discerned her yet in her position against the sun.


---
But the moment he recognized her. 
---
The effect
 upon her old lover was electric, far stronger than the effect of his
 presence upon her. 
---
His fire, the tumultuous ring of his eloquence,
 seemed. 
---
His lip struggled and; but. 
---
His eyes, after their first glance upon her face, hung
 confusedly in every other direction but hers, but. 
---
He was now on the
 side of the Spirit,. 
---
that her Cyprian image had suddenly appeared
 upon his altar,
---
that he was, less by the speed of his
 walk than by the feelings within him
---
" Tess!" he said.


---
!" he repeated. 
---
he came up.


---
he added,
 with a slight laugh
---
," he returned grimly,. 
---
" said he indifferently.
---
Have you ever heard the name of the
 parson of Emminster-- you must have done do?--old Mr Clare; one of the
 most earnest of his school; one of the few intense men left in the
 Church; not so intense as the extreme wing of Christian believers
 with which I have thrown in my lot, but quite an exception among the
 Established clergy. 
---
I only differ from him on the question of Church and
 State-- the interpretation of the text,'. 
---
He is one who, I firmly
 believe, has been the humble means of saving more souls in this
 country than any other man you can name. 
---
You have heard of him?"


---
" He came to Trantridge two or three years ago; and I, wretched fellow that I was, insulted
 him when, in his disinterestedness, he tried to reason with me and
 show me the way. 
---
He did not resent my conduct
---
, he simply said. 
---
There was a strange
 magic in his words. 
---
Who is this better man?"


---
" Well," he declared, a resentment beneath his words. 
---
I am
 a good man
---
The
 inferior man was quiet in him now; but.


---
" Do n't look at me like that!" he said abruptly.


---
he went on
---
how far he was

---
if he knew
---
He told her.


---
that the man was employed by himself and

---
who were working with him in that district
---
"," he remarked,. 
---
D'Urberville was struck mute. 
---
he next murmured. 
---
he broke the silence by adding:" Well-- you
 will see me again."


---
He stepped up to the
 pillar. 
---
"," he continued;
---
"

 He turned to a hunting- gate in the hedge and, without letting his
 eyes again rest upon her,. 
---
As he walked
---
his pace showed
 perturbation, and by- and- by,.

---
,
 he drew from his pocket a small book, between the leaves of which

---
D'Urberville opened the letter. 
---
was signed by Parson Clare
---
The letter began by expressing the writer's unfeigned joy at
 d'Urberville's conversion, and. 
---
It expressed Mr
 Clare's warm assurance of forgiveness for d'Urberville's former
 conduct and his interest in the young man's plans for the future.

---
He, Mr Clare, would much have liked. 
---
he had devoted so many years of his own life, and

---
whose ministry would have helped him; but

---
since his correspondent had possibly not cared
---
, he was not the man to insist
 upon its paramount importance
---
Every man must work as he could best
 work, and in the method towards which he felt impelled by the Spirit.


---
D'Urberville read and. 
---
He also read some passages from memoranda.


---
as he walked

---
till his face assumed a calm, and
---
apparently the image of Tess no
 longer troubled his mind
---
Miss.  It
 was put up in wuld times by the relations of a malefactor who was
 tortured there by nailing his hand to a post and afterwards hung
---
he sold his soul to the devil,
 and
---
that he walks at times
---
They
 were talking no secrets, and the clear unconcerned voice of the young
 woman, in response to the warmer accents of the man, spread into the
 chilly air as the one soothing thing within the dusky horizon, full
 of a stagnant obscurity upon which nothing else intruded. 
---
He is Amby Seedling, the chap who used to sometimes come and help at
 Talbothays
---
" He actually inquired and
 and. 
---
He says. 
---
he's
 been in love wi' me these two years
---
But I've hardly answered him."




---
A man was turning the handle of the machine, and
---
The man at the slicer, having nothing else to do with
 his eyes, continually observed the comer, but
---
her companion directed her attention to his
 approach
---
; it was one in a
 semi- clerical costume, who now represented what had once been the
 free- and- easy Alec d'Urberville. 
---
his preaching

---
Not being hot at there was less enthusiasm about him now, and
---
D'Urberville came up and
---
He glanced round. 
---
if he were overheard
---
They were at some
 distance from the man who turned the slicer, and the movement of the
 machine, too
---
D'Urberville placed himself.


---
"," he continued, with capricious compunction. 
---
he watched her inquiringly,
---
," he added, with a sigh of discontent,--"yours
---
to say," d'Urberville went on. 
---
He drew a piece of parchment from his pocket, with a slight fumbling
 of embarrassment.


---
as he asked the question a disappointment. 
---
which was not entirely
 the disappointment of thwarted duty crossed d'Urberville's face
---
It
 was unmistakably a symptom that something of his old passion for her
 had been revived
---
Surely," he began again, in more impetuous tones, and.


---
When they reached the first newly- ploughed
 section he held out his hand to help her over it
---
" make me a self- respecting man" he
 repeated, as soon as they were over the furrows.


---
"?" he cried. 
---
Anyhow, then, your love for this other man may be."


---
Well then... I have married him."

" Ah
---
!" he exclaimed; and
---
he stopped dead and.


---
For a moment a flash of his old irony marked his face; but
---
he
 determinedly chastened it down.


---
Is that man your husband
---
"?" he asked mechanically,.


---
" That man!" she said proudly. 
---
D'Urberville was disturbed.


---
he retorted hotly. 
---
The
 unbelieving husband is. 
---
He moodily reflected with his eyes on the ground.


---
Well,," he added, quite
 calmly,;". 
---
, whoever he may be
---
if I could know your husband
---
Though,, I
 might more easily benefit him and you. 
---
Is he on this farm?"


---
" He is far away."


---
What sort of husband can he be?"


---
He found out--
---
He does not leave me!
---
" He do n't know it! 
---
" Then, does he write?"


---
that he does not
---
In an impulse he turned suddenly
---
he seized only the rough leather fingers which did not
 express the life or shape of those within.


---
" Yes, yes;," he said abruptly, and. 
---
Facing round, however, he said,"!"


---
what was their business in his
 field
---
" Do n't speak like that to her!" said d'Urberville, his face
.


---
I can see in his face."


---
what a
 churl he is
---
" He wo n't hurt me. 
---
HE'S not in love with me. 
---
, the farmer continued his reprimand, which
 Tess took with the greatest coolness,. 
---
if he had dared
---
To have as a master this man of stone,, was almost a relief after her former
 experiences. 
---
"," he growled. 
---
that he did not harass the other women of the
 farm
---
as he harassed her out of spite for the flooring he had once

---
I could not have married him now
---
He is so unpleasant
 to me."


---
; he
 had asked Izz, and
---
perhaps he did not care for her at
 all. 
---
if it would ever
 reach Angel's hands
---
when d'Urberville's figure darkened the
 window of the cottage
---
D'Urberville's knock, his walk up
 to the door, had some indescribable quality of difference from his
 air. 
---
He came in,.

"
---
" he began desperately,. 
---
as he wiped his
 heated face, which had also a superimposed flush of excitement
---
The suppressed discontent of his manner was almost pitiable, and
---
that the great Power would alter His plans on my
 account
---
" he asked. 
---
"

 D'Urberville looked at her with misgiving.

"
---
H'm--," he said uneasily.


---
so did my
 dear husband... 
---
"," said d'Urberville drily,". 
---
whatever your dear husband
 believed, and
---
whatever he rejected, without the
 least inquiry or reasoning on your own part
---
Your mind is enslaved to his.
---
because he knew everything
---
he must be!
---
" He never forced my judgement! 
---
He would never argue on the subject
 with me! 
---
; what he believed."


---
he to say
---
He must have said something?"


---
, he indulged in a species of
 thinking aloud with her at his side. 
---
d'Urberville thoughtfully murmured the
 words after her.


---
" Anything else?" he presently asked.

"
---
He said at another time something like this"; and
---
what he believed
---
though he did n't wish me to
---
He fell into thought.


---
And so I threw in my spiritual lot with his,
---
What's good enough for him
---
" Does he know?"


---
that you are as big an infidel as he
---
" No-- I never told him--."


---
" Why," he said aridly;"! 
---
He drew from his breast- pocket a poster
---
at which he, d'Urberville, would preach
 the Gospel as aforesaid
---
?" he said, with a soulless sneer in the word. 
---
He laid his hand on
 her shoulder. 
---
" he said. 
---
I was firm
 as a man!" 
---
His voice sank,
 and a hot archness shot from his own black eyes. 
---
; whilst he it seems!"


---
" Do n't speak against him-- he is absent!
---
" Treat him honourably-- he has never wronged you! 
---
that may do harm to his
 honest name
---
I will," he said,
---
A good man's honour is in my keeping--

---
He clenched his lips,. 
---
His
 eyes were equally barren of worldly and religious faith. 
---
which had lain inanimate amid the lines
 of his face
---
ever since his reformation seemed
---
He went out indeterminately.


---
Though d'Urberville had declared,
---
that this breach of his engagement
 to- day was the simple backsliding of a believer
---
Tess's words, as
 echoed from Angel Clare
---
after he had left her
---
He moved on in silence,
---
as
 if his energies were benumbed by
---
the hitherto undreamt- of possibility
 that his position was untenable. 
---
Reason had had nothing to do with
 his whimsical conversion, which was perhaps the mere freak of a
 careless man in search of a new sensation, and temporarily impressed
 by his mother's death.


---
The drops of logic fall into the sea of his enthusiasm
 served. 
---
He said to himself,
!"




---
as he pondered again and again over the crystallized phrases that she
 had handed on to him," That clever fellow little thought that, by
 telling her those things, he might be paving my way back to her
---
a dark, motionless
 being, a sooty and grimy embodiment of tallness, in a sort of trance,
 with a heap of coals by his side: it was the engine- man. 
---
The
 isolation of his manner and colour lent him the appearance of a
 creature from Tophet, who had strayed into the pellucid smokelessness
 of this region of yellow grain and pale soil, with which he had
 nothing in common, to amaze and to discompose its aborigines.


---
What he looked
---
he felt. 
---
He was in the agricultural world, but not of
 it. 
---
He served fire and smoke
---
He travelled with his engine
 from farm to farm, from county to county, for. 
---
He spoke in
 a strange northern accent
---
; his thoughts being turned inwards upon
 himself, his eye on his iron charge,,. 
---
as if some ancient doom
 compelled him
---
which ran from the driving- wheel of
 his engine to the red thresher under the rick
---
he stood apathetic beside his
 portable repository of force,. 
---
He had nothing to do with preparatory labour. 
---
His
 fire was waiting incandescent
---
, his steam was at high pressure, in
 a few seconds
---
he could make the long strap move at an invisible
 velocity. 
---
; it was all the same to him. 
---
If any of the autochthonous
 idlers asked him
---
what he called himself
---
, he replied shortly," an
 engineer."


---
; the men then took their
 places
---
as
 they called him,
---
The old men on the rising straw- rick talked of the past days
 when they had been accustomed to thresh with flails on the oaken
 barn- floor. 
---
, the man could not stop, and she, who had to supply the man with untied
 sheaves, could not stop either, unless Marian changed places with
 her, which she sometimes did for half an hour in spite of Groby's
 objections that she was too slow- handed for a feeder.


---
Groby gave as his motive in
 selecting Tess, and both with staying power, and. 
---
He was
, and
---
he twirled a gay
 walking- cane.


---
Somebody's fancy- man, I s'pose
---
he's after Tess."


---
" Well-- this is the same man."


---
But he's quite different!"


---
He hev left off his black coat and white neckercher, and hev
---
" cut off
 his whiskers; but he's the same man for all that."


---
-- he can do her no harm
---
he's in. 
---
The newcomer was, indeed, Alec d'Urberville, the late Evangelist,
 despite his changed attire and aspect. 
---
; that he had restored
 himself, as nearly as a man
---
immediately after Alec appeared upon the
 stack-- now an oblong and level platform of sheaves
---
He strode across
 them, and.


---
",," said d'Urberville.


---
He regarded her silently for a few moments,
---
, he would
 have let!"


---
without heeding he added:

". 
---
D'Urberville rose and
. 
---
that HE said
---
; how I could have been so fired by poor Parson Clare's
 enthusiasm, and
---
As for, on the strength of
 your wonderful husband's intelligence-- whose name,
 I do n't see my way to that at all."


---
that he had mixed in his dull
 brain two matters, theology and morals, which in the primitive days
 of mankind had been quite distinct
---
Well, never mind," he resumed. 
---
Your husband little thought! 
---
how his teaching would recoil upon
 him
---
" True, true," he said,. 
---
you
 have a husband who is not I. 
---
I've never
 seen him, and
---
you've not told me his name; and
---
altogether he seems
 rather a mythological personage
---
I am nearer to you than he is
---
he does not, bless his invisible face! 
---
shall
 not find him; then return to my first
 husband; for then was it better with me than now!'... 
---
while he spoke
---
"," he continued,
---
stretching
 his arm towards her waist;" you should be willing to share it, and

---
you call husband for ever."


---
it struck him flat on the
 mouth. 
---
Alec
 fiercely started up from his reclining position. 
---
But he soon controlled
 himself,.


---
His voice hardened
, and. 
---
as his temper got the better of him with the recollection of his
 sincerity in asking her and her present ingratitude
---
he stepped
 across to her side and,
---
If you are any man's wife
---
So much for our quarrel," he said,. 
---
D'Urberville
 retreated over the sheaves, and. 
---
the man with the engine was. 
---
He had seen and.

---
while he blew her a kiss
---
that had been gulped down by
 the insatiable swallower, fed by the man and Tess, through whose two
 young hands
---
The man was weary, and

---
that the red nape of his neck was encrusted with dirt
 and husks
---
; in front of it the long red elevator
 like a Jacob's ladder, spouting out on the top
 of the rick
---
that Alec d'Urberville was still on the scene,,
---
There
 was an excuse for his remaining, for when the threshed rick drew
 near its final sheaves a little ratting was always done, and men
 unconnected with the threshing sometimes dropped in for that
 performance-- sporting characters of all descriptions, gents with
 terriers and facetious pipes, roughs with sticks and stones.


---
since d'Urberville had begun
---
that to
 join her friend he did not wish her, and
---
The" friend" was d'Urberville,
 and. 
---
to feel offended at anything or
 do," he answered, in the seductive voice of the Trantridge time.

---
It is not proper
 work for them; and on all the better class of farms it has been given
 up, as he knows very well. 
---
d'Urberville pausing beside her
---
He did not accompany her further,
---
ever since we were married
    to be faithful to you in every thought and look, that even
    when a man speaks a compliment to me,
---
It was purely for security that she had been requested by
 Angel to send her communications through his father,
---
whom he kept

---
he
 had gone.


---
when he had read the envelope,
"
---
if Angel proposes
---
as he told us
---
that he hoped
---
this may hasten his
 plans
---
it to be from his wife
---
He breathed deeply at
 the thought of her; and
---
he will get home safely
---
," murmured Mrs Clare.

---
that he has been
---
You should
 have sent him to Cambridge in spite of his want of faith and. 
---
as the other boys had
---
He would have grown out
 of it under proper influence, and. 
---
Church or no Church, it would have been fairer to him."


---
This was the only wail with which Mrs Clare ever disturbed her
 husband's peace in respect to their sons. 
---
that
 his mind too was
---
troubled by doubts as to his justice in this matter
---
him lying awake at night,
---
that he would have been justified in giving his son,
 an unbeliever, the same academic advantages that he had given to the
 two others, when it was possible
---
which he had
 made it his life's mission and desire to propagate, and the mission
 of his ordained sons likewise
---
To put with one hand a pedestal
 under the feet of the two faithful ones, and with the other to exalt
 the unfaithful by the same artificial means, he deemed.

---
Nevertheless, he loved his misnamed Angel, and. 
---
His silent
 self- generated regrets were far bitterer than the reproaches which
 his wife rendered audible.


---
If Angel had never
 been destined for a farmer he would never have been thrown with
 agricultural girls. 
---
what had separated
 him and his wife, nor the date on which the separation had taken
 place
---
But in his later letters he occasionally
 alluded to the intention of coming home to fetch her;. 
---
He had told them.


---
The eyes were gazing at this
 time on a limitless expanse of country from the back of a mule which
 was bearing him from the interior of the South- American Continent
 towards the coast. 
---
His experiences of this strange land had been
 sad. 
---
from which he had suffered shortly, and
---
after
 his arrival had never wholly left him
---
he had by degrees
---
as
 the bare possibility existed of his remaining
---
to relinquish his hope of farming here, though, as long, he kept this change
 of view a secret from his parents.


---
who had come out to the country
 in his wake
---
He would see mothers from English
 farms trudging along with their infants in their arms, when the child
 would be stricken with fever and would die
---
Angel's original intention had not been emigration to Brazil but a
 northern or eastern farm in his own country. 
---
He had come to this
 place in a fit of desperation, the Brazil movement among the English
 agriculturists having by chance coincided with his desire to escape
 from his past existence.


---
he had
---
What arrested him now as of value in life
---
Having long discredited the old systems of mysticism,
 he now began. 
---
He
 thought. 
---
Who was the moral man? 
---
Viewing her in these lights, a regret for his hasty judgement began
. 
---
Did he reject her eternally, or? 
---
did he not
---
He
 could no longer say.


---
that he would always reject her, and
---
He was greatly perplexed; and
---
in his perplexity as
 to her motives in withholding intelligence, he did not inquire. 
---
if he had understood!--that
---
In the before- mentioned journey by mules through the interior of the
 country, another man rode beside him.
---
Angel's companion was also an
 Englishman, bent on the same errand,. 
---
though he came from another part
 of the island
---
evinced by men,
---
With that
 curious tendency more especially when in distant
 lands, to entrust to strangers details of their lives which they
 would on no account mention to friends, Angel admitted to this man
.


---
as they rode along the sorrowful facts of his marriage
---
The stranger had sojourned in many more lands and among many more
 peoples than Angel
---
; to his cosmopolitan mind such deviations from the
 social norm, so immense to domesticity, were no more than are the
 irregularities of vale and mountain- chain to the whole terrestrial
 curve. 
---
He viewed the matter in quite a different light from Angel.


---
that he was wrong in coming away
 from her
---
Angel's companion
 was struck down with fever, and. 
---
Clare waited
 a few hours, and.


---
he knew
 absolutely nothing beyond a commonplace name
---
The cursory remarks of the large- minded stranger, of whom, were sublimed by his
 death, and. 
---
His own parochialism made him ashamed by its contrast.

---
His inconsistencies rushed upon him in a flood. 
---
He had persistently
 elevated Hellenic Paganism at the expense of Christianity; yet in
 that civilization
---
Surely then he might have regarded that abhorrence of the un- intact
 state, which he had inherited with the creed of mysticism, as at
 least open to correction when the result was due to treachery. 
---
A
 remorse struck into him. 
---
The words of Izz Huett, never quite stilled
 in his memory
---
He had asked Izz,
 and
---
He thought of Tess.

---
How her eyes had lingered upon him
---
when her simple soul uncovered itself to his
---
And during the terrible evening over the
 hearth,, how pitiful her
 face had looked by the rays of the fire, in her inability to realize
 that his love and protection could possibly be withdrawn.


---
Thus from being her critic he grew. 
---
he had uttered to himself about her
---
Cynical
 things; but no man can be always
 a cynic and live; and
---
he withdrew them. 
---
The mistake of expressing
 them had arisen from his allowing himself to be influenced by general
 principles to the disregard of the particular instance.


---
Clare had been harsh towards her
---
Men are too often harsh with women they
 love or have loved; women with men. 
---
whom he had despised as a spent force
---
The historic interest of her family-- that masterful line of
 d'Urbervilles--, touched his
 sentiments now. 
---
Why had he not known the difference between the
 political value and the imaginative value of these things? 
---
So
 does Time ruthlessly destroy his own romances. 
---
In recalling her face
 again and again, he thought now.


---
that he could see therein a flash of
 the dignity which must have graced her grand- dames; and
---
the vision
 sent that_ aura_ through his veins, and

---
which he had formerly felt
---
which was then just being forwarded to him by his father
---
So spoke love renascent, preparing the way for Tess's devoted
 outpouring,;
 though owing to his distance inland it was.


---
that Angel would come in response
 to the entreaty
---
which were his favourite ballads
 among those the country- girls sang
---
that, amongst the snatches of melody, to induce the cows to let down their
 milk, Clare had seemed to like" Cupid's Gardens","
---
all the while at the
 thought that perhaps he would not, after all, come, and
 the simple silly words of the songs resounding in painful mockery of
 the aching heart of the singer
---
as
 father is not very well neither, and
---
" took very bad, and says' tis wrong for a man of
 such a high family as his to slave and drave at common labouring
 work, we do n't know."


---
when he had not danced
 with her
---
that Mrs Durbeyfield was no
 better
---
Her father's ill- health was the same indefinite kind, and
---
he sat in
 his chair as usual. 
---
But the day after her arrival he was unusually
 bright. 
---
He had a rational scheme for living, and
---
," he said,"
---
they thinking nothing of him
---
, he'd ha' done it
---
in a few
 days her father was well enough to see to the garden,
---
, some of the gardening men and women gave over
 for the night, but
---
Nobody looked at his or her companions. 
---
that Clare would ever hear them
---
her father had sent there
---
when the direction of his digging
 brought him closer
---
did he speak to her.

---
that he had not
 been there, and
---
- by
 he dug so close to her
---
that the fire- beams were reflected as
 distinctly from the steel prongs of his fork as from her own
---
that he did the same on the other side
---
The unexpectedness of his presence, the grotesqueness of his
 appearance in a gathered smockfrock, such as was now worn only by the
 most old- fashioned of the labourers,. 
---
D'Urberville emitted a low, long
 laugh.


---
" he remarked whimsically,.


---
" doing it-- it is for my father.
---
" I have no husband!"


---
" he cried lightly
---
About the children-- your brothers and sisters," he resumed.
---
-- he was touching her in a weak place. 
---
He had
. 
---
since your father will not be able to do much
---
He can
---
Why, he
 thinks
---
" He do n't. 
---
I've undeceived him."


---
" The more fool you!"

 D'Urberville in anger retreated from her to the hedge, where he
 pulled off the long smockfrock which had disguised him; and
---
if he had gone back to her father's house
---
father is dead
---
" But father was only a little bit ill!
---
He dropped down just now, and
---
there was no chance for him,
---
because his heart was growed in
---
Her father's life had a value
---
apart from his
 personal achievements, or perhaps it would not have had much.
---
it had long been coveted by the
 tenant- farmer for his regular labourers, who were stinted in cottage

---
The village had formerly contained,
-- the class
 to which Tess's father and mother had belonged-- and including the
 carpenter, the smith, the shoemaker, the huckster, together with
 nondescript workers other than farm- labourers; a set of people
 who owed a certain stability of aim and conduct to the fact of
 their being lifeholders like Tess's father, or copyholders, or
 occasionally, small freeholders. 
---
if not absolutely required by the farmer for his hands
---
, every house standing was required by the agriculturist for his work- people. 
---
The father, and even the mother,
 had got,
---
that his hoofs were almost upon the narrow border for
 plants growing under the wall
---
till he touched the window
 with his riding- crop that she observed him
---
If you are a genuine d'Urberville
---
in which he was
, and
---
he killed her-- or
---
" Father's was the last life on the property, and
---
D'Urberville's face flushed.


---
" he exclaimed in tones of ironic resentment.

---
what men are
---
he will never make it up with
 you. 
---
But d'Urberville persisted
---
; he would not take a negative.


---
," he said,
---
," he resumed. 
---
With the last sentence he had dropped his voice to a murmur, and. 
---
" he said,
---
With these words he rode off. 
---
Just at the corner of the street he
 met the man with the paint- pot, who asked him if he had deserted the
 brethren.


---
"!" said d'Urberville.


---
Her husband, Angel Clare himself, had,
 like others, dealt out hard measure to her
---
; surely he had! 
---
he had surely! 
---
How
 could he give way to entreaty? 
---
: there was
 no new event to alter his opinion.


---
Mrs Durbeyfield's pattens clicked up to the
 door, and
---
He did n't call
---
" He spoke to me in passing."


---
No.  He'll never, never come
---
" Your husband?"

"," answered Tess in stony hopelessness.

"
---
You've seen him before, and
---
What did he say?
---
It was not her husband
---
Yet a consciousness that in a
 physical sense this man alone was her husband.




---
to fetch the goods of the migrating
 families; for it was always by the vehicle of the farmer who required
 his services that the hired man was conveyed to his destination.

---
But to Tess and her mother's household no such anxious farmer sent
 his team. 
---
, a circular nest was made of the beds and bedding, in which
 Joan Durbeyfield and the young children were to sit through the
 journey. 
---
if he chose
---
" Ah-- but I did see him!"
---
" He found me."


---
" And do he know?"


---
" Husband come back?"


---
on which Mrs
 Durbeyfield and her family rode
---
her father had spoken and
---
A man could be seen, and
.


---
when he beheld the nature of their waggon- load
---
he quickened his
 steps
---
You be the woman they call Mrs Durbeyfield
---
?" he said to
 Tess's mother, who had descended to walk the remainder of the way.


---
Though widow of the late Sir John d'Urberville, poor
 nobleman, if I cared for my rights; and."


---
if you be Mrs Durbeyfield
---
The man had noticed the face of Tess, which had become ash- pale at
 his intelligence. 
---
he was bound
---
This done, she paid him,, and
---
he moved off and. 
---
he guessed.


---
As soon they beheld a man on horseback.

---
" Ah-- I'm looking for you!" he said,. 
---
It was Alec d'Urberville. 
---
?" he asked.


---
d'Urberville saying
---
that he
 would see them again, in case
---
went on,, of which he had just heard. 
---
, d'Urberville rode to the inn, and.


---
that the tall
 knights of whom her father had chanted in his cups
---
He leapt off the slab and.


---
"," he said," and. 
---
He stamped with his heel heavily on the floor;
---
he continued. 
---
The little finger of the sham d'Urberville
 can do more for you than the whole dynasty of the real underneath...

---
But in passing
 her he whispered:"!"


---
When he was gone
---
Their talk was of Angel Clare and Tess, and Tess's persistent lover,
 whose connection with her previous history they had partly heard and
 partly guessed ere this.


---
His
 having won her. '
---
if he were
---
Mr Clare can
 never be anything to us, Izz; and? 
---
why should we grudge him to her,
 and
---
If he could on'y know, and
---
, he might come."


---
him know
---
But, a month later, they heard of
 Clare's approaching return,. 
---
This was addressed to Angel Clare at the only place they had ever
 heard him to be connected with, Emminster Vicarage
---
he had not
 been sitting there. 
---
Occasionally he came in,.


---
Mrs Clare,, followed him hither.


---
He does n't reach Chalk- Newton
 till six,
---
" But he has done it in an hour with us, my dear."


---
had he not got out
 of their carriage at the particular moment
---
Mrs Clare rushed through the dark passage to the door, and
---
her
 husband came more slowly after her.


---
they could only see his
 shape against the light.

"
---
O, my boy, my boy-- home again at last!" cried Mrs Clare, who cared
 no more at that moment for the stains of heterodoxy which had caused
 all this separation than for the dust upon his clothes. 
---
O, it is not Angel-- not my son-- the Angel who went away!"
---
His father, too, was shocked to see him, so reduced
---
that Clare had

---
to which he had
---
You could see the
 skeleton behind the man, and almost the ghost behind the skeleton.

---
He matched Crivelli's dead_
---
Christus_.  His sunken eye- pits were of
 morbid hue, and
---
the light in his eyes had waned. 
---
The angular hollows
 and lines of his aged ancestors had succeeded to their reign in his
 face twenty years before their time.


---
," he said. 
---
As if, however, to falsify this assertion, his legs seemed, and
---
he suddenly sat down. 
---
"" he asked. 
---
They had not sent it on to him,
.


---
he would start for home so soon
---
He hastily opened the letter produced, and.


   
---
said Angel,. 
---
that her father is a descendant in the
 male line of one of the oldest Norman houses, like a good many others
 who lead obscure agricultural lives in our villages, and
---
He soon retired to bed; and
---
the next morning, feeling exceedingly
 unwell, he remained in his room. 
---
amid
 which he had left Tess
---
that though, now that he had arrived
---
that her estimate of him had changed under his delay--
---
her present letter,
 showing too
 justly changed, he sadly owned,--made him.

---
Clare therefore thought. 
---
it would be best, and his
 hope that she was still living with them there, as he had arranged
 for her to do when he left England
---
Marlott announcing his return
---
He despatched the inquiry that
 very day, and
---
which did not remove his embarrassment, though to his surprise
---
that me and my Family
    have left Marlott for some Time.--

    Yours,

    J. DURBEYFIELD



---
It was such a relief to Clare. 
---
They were all angry with him,
 evidently. 
---
He would wait till Mrs Durbeyfield. 
---
He deserved no
 more. 
---
His had been a love" which alters when it alteration finds".

---
He had undergone some strange experiences in his absence
---
; he had seen
 the virtual Faustina in the literal Cornelia, a spiritual Lucretia in
 a corporeal Phryne
---
; he had thought of the woman?


---
he had asked himself
---
why he had not judged Tess
 constructively rather than biographically, by the will rather than
 by the deed
---
while he waited at his father's house for the
 promised second note from Joan Durbeyfield, and indirectly to recover
 a little more strength. 
---
Then he hunted up the
 old letter sent on to him in Brazil, which Tess had written from
 Flintcomb- Ash, and re- read it. 
---
The sentences touched him now as
 much as when he had first perused them.


   
---
Clare determined. 
---
that he would no longer believe in her more recent
 and severer regard of him, but
---
He
 asked his father.

---
His father returned a negative, and
---
then for the first time it
 occurred to Angel. 
---
From his remarks his parents now gathered
 the real reason of the separation; and
---
Whilst he was hastily packing together a few articles for his journey

---
he glanced over a poor plain missive also lately come to hand-- the
 one from Marian and Izz Huett, beginning--

" Honour'd Sir
---
In a quarter of an hour Clare was leaving the house,.

---
He had declined,. 
---
He went to the inn, where he hired
 a trap, and. 
---
, he was driving up the hill out of the town which,
 three or four months earlier in the year, Tess had descended with
 such hopes and ascended with such shattered purposes
---
Benvill Lane soon stretched before him, its hedges and trees purple
 with buds; but and. 
---
he was looking at other things,
---
In
 something less than an hour- and- a- half he had skirted the south of
 the King's Hintock estates and
---
the unholy stone whereon Tess had been compelled by
 Alec d'Urberville, in his whim of reformation,. 
---
Thence he went along the verge of the upland, and,. 
---
which he supposed
---
Here, of course, he
 did not find her; and
---
what added to his depression
---
His name her dignified sense of their total severance was

---
of which he now learnt for the first time) rather
 than
---
From this place they told him. 
---
Tess Durbeyfield had gone, without due
 notice, to the home of her parents on the other side of Blackmoor,
 and
---
The farmer Tess
 was quite smooth- tongued to Clare, and
---
he had arrived in being sent back
 to Emminster
---
Clare would not accept the loan of the farmer's vehicle for a further
 distance than to the outskirts of the Vale, and,
---
who had driven him
---
, he put up at an inn, and
---
the region wherein was the spot of his dear Tess's birth.

---
it was of a parcel with his
 expectations.


---
, Clare learned
---
that John
 Durbeyfield was dead
---
; that his widow and children had left Marlott,
. 
---
By this time
 Clare abhorred the house for ceasing to contain Tess, and.


---
His way was by the field. 
---
in which he had first beheld her at the
 dance
---
He passed on through
 the churchyard, where, amongst the new headstones, he saw one of a
 somewhat superior design to the rest. 
---
Some man, apparently the sexton, had observed and. 
---
Clare standing there,

---
" Ah, sir, now that's a man who did n't want to lie
 here, but."


---
where his ancestors be
---
" And why did n't they respect his wish?"


---
The man told the name of a mason in the village, and, on leaving the
 churchyard. 
---
, Clare called at the mason's house
---
He found, and. 
---
This done, he turned in the
 direction of the migrants.


---
Clare felt such a strong
 desire for isolation that at first he would neither hire a conveyance
 nor go to a circuitous line of railway. 
---
by which he might eventually
 reach the place
---
At Shaston, however, he found; but

---
he must hire
---
The village being small he had little difficulty in finding Mrs
 Durbeyfield's tenement, which was a house in a walled garden,
 remote from the main road, where she had stowed away her clumsy old
 furniture as best she could. 
---
him to visit her
---
he felt. 
---
his call to
 be somewhat of an intrusion
---
he was too
 preoccupied to observe more than that she was still a handsome woman,
 in the garb of a respectable widow. 
---
He was obliged, and
---
that
 he was Tess's husband, and his object in coming there
---
he did it
 awkwardly enough. 
---
" to see her at once," he added. 
---
the younger children crept to the door, where, pulling at his mother's skirts,
 the youngest murmured--

" Is this the gentleman who is going to marry Tess?"

"
---
He has married her
---
Clare saw her efforts for reticence, and
---
He was turning away; and
---
then he thought of Tess's tender letter.


---
"" he retorted passionately. 
---
that he suffered
---
he pressed her
 no further.


---
"?" he said gently.


---
Without entering the house Clare turned away. 
---
, he walked thither.

---
it bore Clare
 on its wheels.




---
At eleven o'clock that night, having secured a bed at one of the
 hotels and telegraphed his address to his father immediately on his
 arrival, he walked out into the streets of Sandbourne. 
---
he reluctantly postponed
 his purpose till the morning. 
---
But he could not retire.


---
This fashionable watering- place, with its eastern and its western
 stations, its piers, its groves of pines, its promenades, and its
 covered gardens, was, to Angel Clare, like a fairy place suddenly
 created by the stroke of a wand, and.

---
By the midnight lamps he went up and down the winding way of this new
 world in an old one, and.
---
he
 thought
---
he thought.


---
The more he pondered
---
he
 puzzled
---
he sauntered along,.


---
just after twelve o'clock he entered
 and.  
---
he re
---
Before putting out his light- read Tess's
 impassioned letter. 
---
and he continually lifted the window- blind and
.


---
He might almost as well have sat up all night. 
---
In the morning he
 arose at seven, and. 
---
At the door he met an intelligent postman
 coming out with letters for the morning delivery.


---
Do you know the address of a Mrs Clare
---
The postman
 shook his head.


---
"," he
 said;" and without the name of the house' tis impossible to find
' em."


---
" I know no name of Durbeyfield
---
; but there is the name of d'Urberville
 at The Herons
---
cried Clare, pleased to think that she had reverted to
 the real pronunciation. 
---
Clare received directions, and. 
---
as he feared
---
he was inclined also
---
However, in his doubts he turned to the front, and
.


---
Clare
 inquired for Teresa d'Urberville or Durbeyfield.

"
---
he felt glad,.

"
---
He was shown into the front room-- the dining- room-- and. 
---
it crossed his mind. 
---
He did not blame her
 for one moment. 
---
Soon his sharpened ear detected footsteps upon the
 stairs,. 
---
at which his heart thumped so painfully that he could hardly
 stand firm
---
he said to himself; and.


---
He had held out his arms, but
---
they had fallen again to his side
---
that he was now
---
Mere yellow skeleton, he felt the contrast
 between them, and.

" Tess!"
---
he said huskily,"? 
---
he
 continued. 
---
He kept on. 
---
He was very kind to me,
 and to mother, and to all of us after father's death.
---
" He has won me back to him."


---
Clare looked at her keenly, then,,
---
gathering her meaning flagged
 like one plague- stricken, and his glance sank; it fell on her hands,
.


---
He is upstairs
---
I hate him now,; and
---
because he told me a lie--
---
what he's
 put upon me
---
what he did
---
" said Clare.


---
But he could not get on. 
---
But
 he had a vague consciousness of one thing,
---
though it was not clear
 to him till later
---
he found. 
---
His face
 grew colder and more shrunken,
 and
---
as he stood concentrated on the moment
---
a minute or two after, he found himself in the street,.




---
he did not know whither
---
Nevertheless, the visit of
 Angel Clare to her well- paying tenants, Mr and Mrs d'Urberville,, was sufficiently exceptional in point of time and
 manner.


---
Then a man's voice from the adjoining bedroom--

" What's the matter?"


---
And then my dear, dear husband came home to me... and... 
---
My little sisters and
 brothers and my mother's needs-- they were the things you moved me
 by... and you said my husband would never come back-- never; and you
 taunted me, and said what a simpleton I was to expect him!... 
---
And then he came back!

---
Now he is gone. 
---
I have lost him now
 for ever... and!
---
he will not love me the littlest bit ever any
 more--
---
O yes, I have lost him now-- again because
 of-- you!" 
---
" And he is dying
---
-- he looks
---
as if he
 is dying
---
And my sin will kill him and!... 
---
My own true husband will never,
 never-- O God-- I ca n't bear this!--I"


---
There were more and sharper words from the man
---
Mr d'Urberville might still be asleep,.


---
for he was not
 an early riser
---
the gentleman ring his bell
---
A man one of the workmen employed at an
 adjoining villa, was passing by, and
---
for him
 to pass in,
---
He opened the doors,. 
---
he has been hurt with a knife--
---
who lay on his back, pale, fixed, dead,
---
as
 if he had scarcely moved after the infliction of the blow
---
that a gentleman had been stabbed in his bed
---
Meanwhile Angel Clare had walked automatically along the way by which
 he had come, and,
---
He went on eating and drinking unconsciously
 till on a sudden
---
he demanded his bill;.


---
which, he took his
 dressing- bag in his hand, the only luggage he had brought with him,
 and
---
At the moment of his departure a telegram was handed to him-- a few
 words from his mother,.


---
that they were glad to know his
 address,
---
that his brother Cuthbert had proposed to
 and
---
Clare crumpled up the paper and
---
followed the route to the station;
 reaching it, he found. 
---
He sat down and. 
---
that he could wait there no longer
---
Broken in heart and
 numbed, he had nothing to hurry for; but
---
he wished, and.


---
the train pick him up
 there
---
that he followed
---
He had traversed the greater part of this depression, and

---
, he
 unconsciously looked back. 
---
Why he did
---
so he could not say, but

---
as he could see
---
as he
 gazed a moving spot
---
Clare waited, with a dim sense that
 somebody was trying to overtake him.


---
The form descending the incline was a woman's, yet so entirely was
 his mind blinded to the idea of his wife's following him that even
 when she came nearer he did not recognize her under the totally
 changed attire in which he now beheld her. 
---
that he could believe her
---
, so breathless, so quivering in every muscle, that he
 did not ask her a single question, but
---
, he led her along. 
---
wayfarers he left the high road and
---
that I have killed him
---
he, thinking from the strangeness of her manner
---
when I struck him
 on the mouth with my glove,
---
that I might do it some day for the trap
 he set for me in my simple youth, and his wrong to you through me
---
He has come between us and
---
now he can never do it any
 more. 
---
I never loved him at all
---
, Angel, as I loved you. 
---
, now I
 have killed him
---
he said,
. 
---
"-- you have killed him?"


---
Is he dead?"


---
He heard, and
---
he bitterly taunted me; and
 and
---
He had nagged me about you before. 
---
By degrees he was inclined
---
his horror at her impulse
 was mixed with amazement at the strength of her affection for
 himself, and
---
he looked
 at her--. 
---
as his confused and excited ideas could

---
As well reason, he supposed.


---
that he would be anything
 to her but a protector
---
He saw. 
---
him to be
---
Tenderness was
 absolutely dominant in Clare at last. 
---
He kissed her endlessly with
 his white lips, and! 
---
as he had become
---
Worn and unhandsome, it
 was plain that she did not discern the least fault in his appearance.

---
To her he was,
---
He was still her Antinous, her Apollo even
---
; his sickly
 face was beautiful as the morning to her affectionate regard on
 this day no less than when she first beheld him
---
; for was it not the
 face of the one man on earth who had loved her purely, and!


---
as he had

---
he persuaded
 her. 
---
till he should come back
---
He soon returned, with food
 enough for half- a- dozen people and two bottles of wine-- enough, should any emergency arise.


---
"," Clare remarked. 
---
"," said Clare. 
---
"!" he said. 
---
And
 kissing her sad mouth, he again led her onwards.


---
He was growing weary likewise,, and
---
He thought the season insufficiently advanced.


---
," he said.

---
He then requested her,.


---
whilst he went
---
Clare crept
 towards the house. 
---
His absence lasted some considerable time, and

---
when he returned
---
He had found out from a boy that there was only an old woman in
 charge as caretaker, and
---
rest there," said he.


---
Clare clambered in, and.


---
Clare unlatched the door of a large chamber,.

---
he, setting down his bag and the parcel of
 viands
---
Then Clare again stole a chink of light from
 the window, and
---
He had never known of that till now.


---
he said. 
---
Clare, rightly informed. 
---
he took advantage of the fog. 
---
His re- entry awoke her; and

---
they breakfasted on what he had brought.


---
Whenever he suggested
---
He peeped out also. 
---
his," I fear
---
any man should,
---
, Tess's lips being parted like a half- opened flower
 near his cheek. 
---
as he was dressed
---
As soon he narrowly
 scanned the lawn through the two or three inches of shutter- chink.


---
"," said he. 
---
He decided, and. 
---
At dusk Clare
 purchased food as usual, and
---
They had proceeded thus gropingly two or three miles further when
 on a sudden Clare. 
---
" said Angel.


---
He listened. 
---
lifting his hand and advancing a step or
 two, Clare felt the vertical surface of the structure. 
---
Carrying his fingers
 onward he found. 
---
what he had come in contact with
---
by stretching out his left hand he could feel a
 similar one adjoining
---
Angel, perplexed, said--

"?"


---
" A very Temple of the Winds," he said.


---
" said Clare.


---
He knelt down beside her outstretched form, and.


---
Clare, and he flung his overcoat upon her, and.


---
he fell into thought. 
---
In the far north- east sky he
 could see between the pillars a level streak of light. 
---
" No," said he.


---
He kissed her.


---
at the critical
 time he did not answer
---
In a minute or
 two her breathing became more regular, her clasp of his hand relaxed,
 and she fell asleep. 
---
It was the head of a man approaching them
 from the hollow beyond the Sun- stone. 
---
Clare wished but. 
---
He heard something behind him, the brush of feet. 
---
Turning, he saw
 over the prostrate columns another figure
---
then before he was aware
---
The dawn shone full on the front of the man westward, and

---
Clare could discern from this, and. 
---
that he was tall
---
Springing to his feet, he looked around for a weapon,
 loose stone, anything. 
---
By this time the nearest
 man was upon him.


---
sir," he said. 
---
he implored in a whisper of the men.


---
He went to the stone and bent over her,
---
" Yes, dearest," he said. 
---
neither of the men
 having moved
---
One of the pair was Angel Clare, the other a tall budding
 creature-- half girl, half woman-- a spiritualized image of Tess,
 slighter than she, but with the same beautiful eyes-- Clare's
 sister- in- law,' Liza- Lu. 
---
In the valley
 beneath lay the city, the spires of St Thomas's, the pinnacled tower of the College, and,
 more to the right, the tower and gables of the ancient hospice,
 where to this day the pilgrim may receive his dole of bread and ale.

---
the President of the Immortals, in Aeschylean
 phrase, had ended his sport with Tess.
