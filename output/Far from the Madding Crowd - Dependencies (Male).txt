 DESCRIPTION OF FARMER OAK-- AN INCIDENT


, the corners of his mouth
 spread, his eyes were reduced to chinks, and
---
His Christian name was Gabriel, and
---
on working
 days he was a young man of sound judgment, easy
 motions, proper dress, and general good character.
---
On
 Sundays he was a man of misty views, rather given to
 postponing, and
---
hampered by his best clothes and
 umbrella
---
who felt himself
---
:  upon the whole, one to
 occupy morally that vast middle space of Laodicean
 neutrality,-- that is, he went
 to church, but
---
when he meant
---
when his friends
 and critics were in tantrums
---
Or, to state his character, he was considered rather a
 bad man
---
;, he was rather a good
 man
---
; neither, he was a man
---
Since he lived six times
---
as many working- days as
 Sundays, Oak's appearance in his old clothes was most
 peculiarly his own-- the mental picture formed by his
 neighbours in imagining him being always dressed in
 that way.
---
He wore a low- crowned felt hat,
---
; his lower
 extremities being encased in ordinary leather leggings
 and boots emphatically large,.

---
damp-- their maker being a conscientious man who
 endeavoured to compensate for any weakness in his cut
 by unstinted dimension and solidity
---
Mr. Oak carried about him, by way of
---
This instrument being several
 years older than Oak's grandfather
---
The stopping peculiarity of his
 watch Oak, and he
 escaped any evil consequences from the other two
 defects by constant comparisons with and observations
 of the sun and stars, and by pressing his face close
 to the glass of his neighbours' windows.
---
, till he could
 discern the hour marked by the green- faced timekeepers
 within
---
which also
 lay at a remote height under his waistcoat
---
that Oak's fob being
 difficult of access, by reason of its somewhat high
 situation in the waistband of his trousers(), the watch
 was as a necessity pulled out by throwing the body to
 one side, compressing the mouth and face to a mere
 mass of ruddy flesh on account of the exertion, and
 drawing up the watch by its chain, like a bucket from a
 well
---
But some thoughtfull persons, him
 walking across one of his fields on a certain December
 morning-- sunny and exceedingly mild
---
In
 his face one might notice.

---
: there even
 remained in his remoter crannies some relics of the boy
---
His height and breadth would have been sufficient to
 make his presence imposing,.
---
But there is a way some men
 have,
---
that would have become a
 vestal which seemed continually to impress upon him
 that he had no great claim on the world's room
---
And from a quiet modesty, Oak
 walked unassumingly and with a faintly perceptible
 bend, yet distinct from a bowing of the shoulders.

---
if he
 depends for his valuation more upon his appearance
 than upon his capacity to wear well, which Oak did not
---
He had just reached the time of life.

---
He was at the brightest period of masculine growth,
 for his intellect and his emotions
---
were clearly separated:
 he had passed the time during which the influence of
 youth indiscriminately mingles them in the character
 of impulse, and
---
he had not yet arrived at the stage
 by the influence of a wife and family.
---
In
 short, he was twenty- eight, and a bachelor.

---
he was in this morning
---
, Oak saw
 and.
---
Gabriel had not beheld the sight for more
 than half a minute,.

---
when the vehicle was brought to a
 standstill just beneath his eyes
---
He was not yet in sight; and
---
A
 cynical inference was irresistible by Gabriel Oak, generous.
---
as he
 regarded the scene
---
though he fain would have

---
in
 which men would play a part--
---
, Gabriel withdrew
 from his point of espial, and
---
where the object of his
 contemplation now halted for the payment of toll
---
About
 twenty steps still remained between him and the gate,
.
---
when he heard a dispute
---
Oak looked from one to the other of the disputants,
 and.
---
he said,."
---
He looked up at her then
---
Gabriel's features adhered throughout their form so
 exactly to the middle line between the beauty of St.
 John and the ugliness of Judas Iscariot,
---
he attended,.
---
in gaining her a passage he had lost her
 her point, and
---
"" he said to Oak
"
---
" said Gabriel.

---
"
" What, then?"
 Gabriel, perhaps a little, glanced back to
---
where he had

---
that he is in the presence of a shape approaching the
 indestructible as nearly as any
---
till he
 was now at a right angle with the meridian
---
They were the notes of Farmer Oak's flute.

---
the traditionary outlines
 and general form of the Ark are established in men's
 imaginations among their firmest,
---
During the twelvemonth pre-
 ceding this time he had been enabled by sustained
 efforts of industry and chronic good spirits to lease the
 small sheep farm of which
---
Previously he
 had been a bailiff for a short time, and earlier still a
 shepherd only,.

---
till old
 Gabriel sank to rest
---
This venture, unaided and alone, into the paths of
 farming as master and not as man, with an advance of
 sheep not yet paid for, was a critical juncture with
 Gabriel Oak, and
---
he recognised his position clearly.

---
The first movement in his new progress was the lambing
 of his ewes, and
---
sheep having been his speciality from
 his" youth
---
, he wisely refrained from deputing-- the task
 of tending them at this season to a hireling or a novice.

---
A rectangular space
 of light appeared in the side of the hut, and in the
 opening the outline of Farmer Oak's figure.
---
He carried
 a lantern in his hand, and
---
as he stood before or behind it
---
Oak's motions, though they had a quiet- energy
---
their deliberateness accorded well with his
 occupation.
---
that his steady swings and turns"
 in and- about the flock had elements of grace
---
although he could do or
---
as can the men of towns
 who are more to the manner born, his special power,
 morally, physically, and mentally, was static, owing
 little or nothing to momentum as a rule.

---
had
 been appropriated by Farmer Oak for his great purpose
 this winter
---
Detached hurdles thatched with straw
 were stuck into the ground at various scattered points,
 amid and under which the whitish forms of his meek
 ewes moved and rustled.
---
which had been silent during his absence,
---
till Oak withdrew again from the flock
---
He
 --  returned to the hut,.

---
he placed on a wisp of hay
 before the small stove, where a can of milk was simmer-
 ing
---
Oak extinguished the lantern by blowing into it
 and then pinching the snuff
---
here the young man stretched himself along,.
---
, Farmer Oak was asleep.

---
Passing
 from the profoundest sleep to the most alert wakefulness
 with the same ease operation, he looked at his watch,.
---
After
 placing the little creature with its mother, he stood and
.

---
" One o'clock." said Gabriel.

---
that there was some charm in this life he led
---
Being a man not without a frequent consciousness
, he stood
 still after looking at the sky as a useful instrument, and
.
---
For a moment he seemed
 impressed with the speaking loneliness of the scene, or
 rather with the complete abstraction from all its compass
 of the sights and sounds of man.
---
no sentient
 being save himself
---
there
 seemed to be on the shaded hemisphere of the globe; he could fancy them.
  
---
what he had previously taken low
 down behind the outskirts of the plantation
---
Farmer Oak went towards the plantation and.
---
A dim mass under
 the slope reminded him.
---
Through crevices in the roof and side
 spread streaks and spots of light, a combination of which made
 the radiance that had attracted him.
---
Oak stepped up behind,
.
 
---
close
 to a hole, he could see into the interior clearly
---
; he could form no decided opinion
 upon her looks, her position being almost beneath his eye,.
---
so
 that he saw her in a bird's- eye view, as
---
we were rich enough to pay a man to do these
 things
---
Beside her Oak now
 noticed a little calf about a day old,.

---
Oak, upon hearing these remarks, became more
 curious, but and
---
this prospect being
 denied him by the hooding effect of the cloak,
---
by his
 aerial position, he felt.
---
himself drawing upon his fancy
 for their details
---
Had Gabriel
 been able from the first
---
to get a distinct view of her-
 countenance, his estimate of it as very handsome or
 slightly so would have been.

---
Having for some time known the want of a satisfactory
 form to fill an increasing void within him, his position
 moreover affording the widest scope for his fancy
---
, he
 painted her a beauty.

---
Oak knew her instantly as the heroine of the yellow
 waggon, myrtles, and looking- glass:  prosily, as the
 woman who owed him twopence.

---
Gabriel
 Oak returned to his flock.





---
, Oak went again into
 the plantation.
---
Lingering and musing here, he heard
 the steps of a horse at the foot of the hill, and.
---
Gabriel instantly thought of the hat
---
He hastily scanned the ditch and
---
Gabriel took it in his hand and.
---
Here he ensconced himself, and.

---
Gabriel was about to advance and
.
---
when an unexpected per-
 formance induced him
---
Gabriel's
 eyes had scarcely been able to follow her.
---
Oak was amused, perhaps a little astonished, and
 hanging up the hat in his hut.
---
The boy led away the horse,.

---
Gabriel took the
 lost hat in his hand, and.

---
Oak wish
---
Gabriel's face rising like the
 moon behind the hedge
---
That the girl's thoughts hovered about her face
 and form as soon as she caught Oak's eyes conning the
 same page
---
as if
 Gabriel had been irritating its pink surface by actual
 touch, and
---
Yet it was the man who blushed, the maid not
 at all.

---
"" said Oak.

---
You are Farmer Oak
---
" Here- going through the plantation, and all down
 the hill." said Farmer Oak, with an aspect excessively
 knowing with regard to some matter in his mind,.

---
as he
 gazed at a remote point in the direction named, and
---
him to withdraw his own eyes
 from hers as suddenly as if he had been caught in a
 theft
---
From
 the Maiden's Blush, through all varieties of the Provence
 down to the Crimson Tuscany, the countenance of Oak's
 acquaintance quickly graduated
---
; whereupon he, in con-
 siderateness, turned away his head.

---
The sympathetic man still looked the other way, and
.
---
He heard.
---
Gabriel returned to his work.

---
His want of
 tact had deeply offended her-- not by seeing what he
 could not help, but by letting her know.
---
that he had

---
that Gabriel's espial had made her an indecorous woman
 without her own connivance
---
It was food for great regret
 with him
---
; it was also a contretemps which touched into
 life a latent heat he had experienced in that direction.

---
As the milking- hour drew near, Oak kept.
---
At last he felt cold, and
.
---
round the yearling
 ewes he entered the hut and
---
Oak laid a sack there and.
---
Gabriel had always known that when the fire was
 lighted and the door closed one of these must be kept
 open-- that chosen being always on the side away from
 the wind.
---
Closing the slide to windward, he turned
---
that he would first sit down
---
He sat down.

---
His head began, and,

---
, Oak decided.
---
himself to fall asleep
---
He fell
 asleep, however, without having performed the necessary
 preliminary.

---
How long he remained unconscious
---
Gabriel never
 knew.
---
His dog was howling
---
, his head was aching fearfully--

---
somebody was pulling him about,
---
hands were loosening
 his neckerchief.

---
On opening his eyes he found.
---
More than this-- astonishingly
 more-- his head was upon her lap, his face and neck
.

---
her fingers were unbuttoning
 his collar
---
" said Oak, vacantly.

---
" Ah, the hut!" murmured Gabriel.
---
Gabriel, by way of emphasis,
 brought down his fist upon the floor.

---
"" said Oak, absently.
---
He
 was endeavouring
---
, his head upon her dress, before
 the event passed on into the heap of bygone things.

---
He wished; but
---
he would as
 soon have thought of carrying an odour in a net as of
 attempting to convey the intangibilities of his feeling
 in the coarse meshes of language.
---
So he remained
 silent.

---
him sit up,
---
then Oak began.
---
" he said at last, gratefully,.
---
some of the
 natural rusty red having returned to his face
---
her smile to hold good for Gabriel's next
 remark,
---
My
 uncle has a hut like this one, and
---
him tell
 his shepherd
---
Gabriel said, in a
 low voice,.

---
which was rather meant to travel back to
 himself than to her
---
" My name is Gabriel Oak."

---
You seem fond of yours in
 speaking it so decisively, Gabriel Oak."

---
He held it but an instant, and
---
he said, the instant after.

---
Oak held it longer this time-- indeed, curiously long.

---
" being winter time, too-- not chapped
 or rough or anything!" he said.

---
said Gabriel,
 simply;" but I will"
" That you wo n't!
---
Gabriel felt himself guilty of another want of tact.

---
THE only superiority in women is, as a rule, that of the unconscious kind; but
 a superiority which recognizes itself may sometimes
 please by suggesting possibilities of capture to the
 subordinated man.

---
Love, being an extremely exacting usurer( a sense of
 exorbitant profit, spiritually, by an exchange of hearts,
 being at the bottom of pure passions, as that of exorbi-
 tant profit, bodily or materially, is at the bottom of
 those of lower atmosphere), every morning Oak's feelings
 were as sensitive as the money- market in calculations
 upon his chances.
---
His dog waited for his meals in a
 way.
---
so like that in which Oak waited for the girl's
 presence,
---
However, he continued, and
---
thus his sentiments
 towards her were deepened without any corresponding
 effect being produced upon herself.
---
Oak had
---
not being able
 to frame love phrases;
 passionate tales--
     -- Full of sound and fury
   -- signifying nothing--
 he said no word at all.

---
By making inquiries he found.
---
He dreaded the eight day.

---
Gabriel had reached a
 pitch of existence
---
he never could have anticipated a
 short time before.
---
He liked
---
though he had sworn by brown
---
ever
 since he was a boy
---
he
 filled in a possible strength in an actual weakness
---
Oak
 began now, and!"

---
while he was perplexing himself about an
 errand on which he might consistently visit the cottage
 of Bathsheba's aunt
---
He found his opportunity in the death of a ewe,
 mother of a living lamb.
---
On a day,, Oak put the lamb
 into a respectable Sunday basket, and
---
Gabriel had watched the blue wood- smoke curling
 from the chimney with strange meditation.
---
At evening
 he had fancifully traced it down the chimney to the
 spot of its origin--
---
seen the hearth and Bathsheba
 beside it-- beside it in her out- door dress; for the
 clothes were by association
 equally with her person included in the compass of his
 affection; they seemed at this early time of his love a
 necessary ingredient of the sweet mixture called Bath-
 sheba Everdene.

---
He had made a toilet of a nicely- adjusted kind-- of a
 nature between the carefully neat and the carelessly
 ornate-- of a degree between fine- market- day and wet-
 Sunday selection.
---
He thoroughly cleaned his silver
 watch- chain with whiting,
---
he possessed upon his usually dry, sandy
---
till he had deepened it to a
 splendidly novel colour, between that of guano and
 Roman cement,
---
it stick to his head
---
It seemed, for, as the rather untoward commence-
 ment of Oak's overtures,
---
just as he arrived by the garden
 gate
---
, he saw a cat inside,.

---
for he had arrived at an age
 at which all superfluous barking was cynically avoided
 as a waste of breath
---
-- in fact he never barked even
 at the sheep except to order, when it was done with
 an absolutely neutral countenance, as a sort of Com-
 mination- service, which, though offensive, had to be
 gone through once now and then to frighten the flock
 for their own good.

---
"" said Oak to the voice," but
.
---
Almost before he had ceased
---
speaking, Oak was

---
whose ear was the recipient
 of his answer.
---
he heard.

---
Gabriel meditated, and so deeply that he brought
 small furrows into his forehead by sheer force of
 reverie.
---
Oak went up to the door a little
 abashed: .

---
his mental rehearsal and the reality had had
 no common grounds of opening
---
said Mr. Oak.
---
" Oh, thank' ee, said Gabriel,.
---
any other young
 man hanging about her at all
---
Not
 that her young men ever come here-- but,
---
said Farmer Oak, contemplating
 a crack in the stone floor with sorrow.
---
" I'm only an
 every- day sort of man, and
---
When Gabriel had gone about two hundred yards along the
 down
---
, he heard a" hoi- hoi!"
---
uttered behind
 him, in a piping note of more treble quality than that
 in which the exclamation usually embodies itself.
---
He looked round, and.

---
Oak stood still-- and
---
Gabriel's colour deepened
---
to see you," said Gabriel,.

---
he said,.
---
I had
 a young man
---
said
 Farmer Oak, smiling one of his long special smiles, and
 blushing with gladness.
---
He held out his hand.
---
Directly he seized it,."

---
so that it slipped through his fingers like
 an eel
---
"" said Gabriel, with
 half a degree less assurance than when he had seized
 her hand.

---
" A man has advanced me money to begin with, but

---
though I am only an
 every- day sort of man
---
since I was
 a boy
---
" Gabriel uttered" a little" in a tone to- show
 her."

---
He went forward and.

---
his advance take the form of an attitude

---
over the top, looking
 at him with rounded eyes," I never said."

---
said Oak,  with dismay."
---
you do n't
 want him
---
Oak added with a more appreciative sense
 of all the circumstances--."
"
---
" said Gabriel,
---
," said he to the back of her
 head, across the bush.
---
He regarded the red berries between them over and

---
" Well!"
" Why, he'd always be there,;
---
, there he'd be."

---
" Of course he would--
---
if I could be one without having
 a husband
---
"" said Oak.
---
he continued in a palliative voice,
---
Oak sighed a deep honest sigh-- none
---
" he appealed,
.

---
" he persisted,.

---
." said Mr Oak, so earnestly that he seemed
 to be coming, by the force of his words, straight
 through the bush and into her arms.
---
His
 voice had a genuine pathos now, and
---
his large brown
 hands perceptibly trembled.

---
" It would n't do, Mr Oak.
---
Oak cast his eyes down the field in a way.
"
---
he naively said.

---
Farmer Oak had one- and- a- half Christian character-
 istics too many:  his humility,
 and a superfluous moiety of honesty.
---
He broke in passionately."
---
Because I am open enough to own what
 every man in my shoes would have thought of, you
 make your colours come up your face, and.
---
your uncle at Weatherbury is
---
he said, with a laugh.

---
No man likes.
---
." said Oak,
 firmly, with the bearing of one who was going to give"
 his days and nights to Ecclesiastes for ever.
---
which one day reached Gabriel
---
THE news, that Bath-
 sheba Everdene had left the neighbourhood, had an
 influence upon him which might have surprised any
 who never suspected that the more emphatic the renun-
 ciation the less absolute its character.

---
which was
 the means that chance offered to Gabriel Oak by
 Bathsheba's disappearance though effectual with people
 of certain humours
---
Oak belonged
 to the even- tempered order of humanity, and
---
felt the
 secret fusion of himself in Bathsheba to be burning with
 a finer flame now-- that was all.

---
His incipient friendship with her aunt- had been
 nipped by the failure of his suit, and
---
that Oak learnt
 of Bathsheba's movements
---
in what capacity--
 whether as a visitor, or permanently, he could not
 discover.

---
Gabriel had two dogs.
---
that George knew the exact degrees of condemnation
 signified by cursing and swearing of all descriptions
 better than the wickedest old man in the neighbourhood
---
that he knew to a hair's
 breadth the rate of trotting back from the ewes' tails
 that each call involved,
---
Though old, he was clever
 and trustworthy still.

---
The young dog, George's son, might possibly have
 been the image of his mother,.
---
for there was not much
 resemblance between him and George
---
He was learn-
,, but
---
So earnest
 and yet so wrong- headed was this young dog( he had no,
 name in particular, and)
---
, that if sent behind the
 flock to help them on, he did it so thoroughly that he
 would have chased them across the whole county with
 the greatest pleasure if not called off or reminded when
 to step by the example of old George.

---
when Farmer Oak had returned to
---
there would be no further necessity for
 his attendance on the down
---
One night,, his
 house, believing, he called as usual to the
 dogs, previously to shutting them up in the outhouse till
 next morning.
---
- Gabriel then remembered
---
that he had left the
 two dogs on the hill, except when other food- ran
 finished his meal
---
he usually kept from them
---
eating a dead lamb( a kind of meat
, he went indoors to the luxury of a bed,
.

---
which latterly he had only enjoyed on Sundays
---
Just before dawn he was

---
The
 experienced ear of Oak knew the sound.

---
he now heard

---
He jumped out of bed,.
---
The
 forward ewes were kept apart from those among which
 the fall of lambs would be later, there being two hundred
 of the latter class in Gabriel's flock.
---
There
 were the fifty with their lambs, enclosed at the other end
 as he had left them, but the rest,,.
---
Gabriel called at the top of
 his voice the shepherd's call.
" Ovey, ovey, ovey!"

---
He went to the hedge
---
Rather surprised to find
 fence at this season, yet putting it down
 instantly to their great fondness for ivy in winter- time, he followed
 through the hedge.
---
He called again: 
---
He passed through the trees and
 along the ridge of the hill.
---
On the extreme summit,
, he saw.

---
A horrible conviction darted through Oak.
---
With
 a sensation of bodily faintness he advanced:  at one
 point
---
there he saw
 the footprints of his ewes.
---
that he expected
 some great reward for signal services rendered
---
Oak
 looked over the precipice.
---
Oak was an intensely humane man
---
: indeed, his
 humanity often tore in pieces any politic intentions of
 his which bordered on strategy, and.
---
carried him on as
 by gravitation
---
A shadow in his life had always been
.
---
that his flock ended in mutton--
---
His first feeling now was one of pity for the
 untimely fate of these gentle ewes and their unborn
 lambs.

---
; his hopes
 of being an independent farmer were laid low-- possibly
 for ever.
---
Gabriel's energies, patience, and industry had
 been so severely taxed during the years of his life between
 eighteen and eight- and- twenty,.
---
Farmer
 Oak recovered from his.
---
It was as remarkable as it was
 characteristic that the one sentence he uttered was in
 thankfulness: --

---
Oak raised his head, and.
---
what he could
 do
---
The pool glittered like a dead
 man's eye, and
---
All this Oak
 saw and.

---
As far as could be learnt it appeared that the poor
 young dog, still under the impression that since he was
 kept for running after sheep, the more he ran after
 them the better and.

---
George's son had done his work so thoroughly that
 he was considered too good a workman to live, and another instance of the untoward fate which
 so often attends dogs and other philosophers who
 follow out a train of reasoning to its logical conclusion,
 and attempt perfectly consistent conduct in a world
 made up so largely of compromise.

---
Gabriel's farm had been stocked by a dealer-- on the
 strength of Oak's promising look and character-- who
 was receiving a percentage from the farmer till such
 time as the advance.





---
that the value of stock, plant, and implements his own would be about sufficient to pay his
 debts,
---
he
 stood up in, and nothing more
---
in fact, his
 superiority was marked enough to lead several ruddy
 peasants standing by to speak to him inquiringly, as to
 a farmer, and to use` Sir' as a finishing word
---
His
 answer always was,
.
---
Gabriel was paler now.
---
His eyes were more medi-
 tative, and
---
his expression was more sad.
---
He had

---
He had sunk
 from his modest elevation as pastoral king into the very
 slime- pits of Siddim
---
he had never before known
---
which, though it often makes a villain of
 a man
---
a sergeant and his party had been beating up
 for recruits through the four streets
---
he found
---
himself not hired
---
, Gabriel
 almost wished.
---
that he had joined them, and
---
he
 turned his hand to
---
Weary of standing in the market-
 place, and not much minding the kind of work, he decided.

---
Sheep- tending was Gabriel's speciality.
---
Turning down
 an obscure street and entering an obscurer lane, he went
 up to a smith's shop.
"
---
He sat on a bench and
---
He then went to a ready- made clothes' shop
---
As the
 crook had absorbed most of Gabriel's money
---
, he
 attempted, and.

---
, he again
 hurried off to the centre of the town, and.

---
Now that Oak had turned himself into a shepherd
---
However, two
 or three farmers noticed him and.
---
Gabriel, like his dog, was
 too good to be trustworthy,.
---
and he never made advance
 beyond this point.

---
Some merry men were whistling and
 singing by the corn- exchange.
---
which
 had lain for some time idle in his smock- frock pocket
---
Gabriel's hand,,
 touched his flute which he carried there.
---
Here was
 an opportunity for putting his dearly bought wisdom
 into practice.

---
He drew out his flute and.
---
Oak could pipe with Arcadian
 sweetness and the sound of the well- known notes
.

---
He played on with spirit, and.

---
what was a small fortune to a destitute
 man
---
he learnt
---
Oak resolved-- that-- night on his way to Shottsford,
 and.

---
if Oak kept
---
if he
 stopped
---
He passed by Yalbury- Wood
 where the game- birds were rising to their roosts, and
.

---
he had walked three or four miles every
 shape in the- landscape
---
He descended Yalbury Hill and.

---
On coming close, he found there were no horses
 attached to it, the spot being apparently quite deserted.

---
Gabriel sat down on the shafts of the vehicle and
---
con-
 sidered his position.
---
He calculated
---
that he had walked
 a very fair proportion of the journey; and
---
having been
 on foot since daybreak, he felt.

---
he had taken the precaution
---
Eating his las slices of bread and ham, and drinking
 from the bottle of cider to
 bring with him, he got into the lonely waggon.
---
Here
 he spread half of the hay as a bed, and, as well as he
 could in the darkness, physically, as comfortable as ever he had been
 in his life.
---
for
 a man like Oak, introspective far beyond his neighbours,
 to banish quite, whilst conning the present
---
So, thinking of his misfortunes,
 amorous and pastoral he fell asleep, shepherds enjoying,
 in common with sailors, the privilege of being able to
 summon the god instead of having to wait for him.

---
On somewhat suddenly awaking after a sleep of
 whose length he had no idea
---
, Oak found.
---
He was being carried along the road
 at a rate rather considerable for a vehicle without
 springs, and
---
under circumstances of physical uneasiness,
 his head being dandled up and down on the bed of
 the waggon like a kettledrum- stick.
---
He then dis-
 tinguished voices in conversation,.
---
His concern at this dilemma
(, had he been a thriving
 man; but the first
 sight he beheld.
---
Gabriel concluded.

---
in other words, that he had slept two hours
---
whilst he was stealthily turning
, if possible, into whose hands
---
he had fallen
---
Gabriel soon found
---
they had come from Casterbridge fair, like
 himself
---
It came
" from the man who held the reins.

---
a man can wish for
---
I feel quite
 a new man!
---
" That I do n't know, Master Poorgrass."

---
On hearing these and other similar remarks, a wild
 thought flashed into Gabriel's mind.
---
not to alarm the speakers
 unnecessarily, Gabriel slipped out of the waggon unseen.

---
He turned to an opening in the hedge, which he
 found to be a gate, and
---
mounting thereon, he sat
.
---
The crunching jangle of the
 waggon died upon his ear.
---
He was about to walk on,
.
---
when he noticed on his left hand an unusual light--

---
Oak watched it,
 and
---
Gabriel again mounted the gate, and,,.
---
what he found to be ploughed
 soil
---
The blaze, enlarging in a  double ratio by his
 approach and its own increase, showed him.
---
as he drew
 nearer the outlines of ricks beside it,
---
His weary face now began, and.
---
the whole front of his smock-
 frock and gaiters was covered with a dancing shadow
 pattern of thorn- twigs-- the light reaching him through
 a leafless intervening hedge-- and the metallic curve of
 his sheep- crook shone silver- bright in the same abound-
 ing rays
---
He came up to the boundary fence, and
.
---
before Gabriel's eyes was a- rick of straw,
---
,
 Oak suddenly ceased from being a mere spectator
 by discovering the case to be more serious.
---
than he had

---
as he had

---
Gabriel leapt over the hedge, and.
---
that he was
 not alone
---
he came to
---
The first man was running
 about in a great hurry,.

---
as if his thoughts were several
 yards in advance of his body, which they could never
 drag on fast enough
---
Other figures now
 appeared behind this shouting man and among the
 smoke, and
---
Gabriel found
---
that, far from being alone
 he was in a great company--
---
" Stop the draught under the wheat- rick!" cried
 Gabriel to those nearest to him.
---
" Get a tarpaulin-- quick!" said Gabriel.

---
" A ladder." cried Gabriel.

---
Oak seized,"
 and
---
as if he
 were going
---
, he clambered up the beetling
 face.
---
He at once sat astride the very apex, and.

---
Billy Smallbury-- one of the men-- by this time had found a ladder, which
 Mark Clark ascended,.
---
He's a shepherd."
---
" Yes--
 he is.
---
how his crook shines
---
as he beats the rick
 with it
---
And his smock- frock is burnt in two holes
---
A fine young shepherd he is too, ma'am."

---
Whose shepherd is he?"
---
D'ye think Jan Coggan
---
that bold
 shepherd up there-- he
 sitting on the top
---
o' rick, whizzing his great long- arms
 about like a windmill
---
He does work hard.
---
he was shepherd here
---
Do n't
 any of you know his name."

---
Gabriel's elevated
 position being no longer required of him
---
, he made as
 if to descend.
" Maryann."
---
as he comes down
---
he has done
---
his features smudged, grimy, and undiscoverable
 from the smoke and heat
---
Oak,, his smock- frock burnt- into
 holes and dripping with water, the ash stem of his sheep-
 crook charred six inches shorter.
---
He lifted his
 hat with respect, and
---
not without gallantry: stepping
 close to her hanging feet he said in a hesitating voice,--
"?"

---
Gabriel and his cold- hearted
 darling, Bathsheba Everdene, were face to face.

---
he mechanically
 repeated in an abashed and sad voice,--
"?"





---
There was room for a little pity, also for a very little
 exultation:  the former at his position, the latter at her
 own.
---
putting on an air of dignity,
 and turning again to him with a little warmth of cheek;
" I do want a shepherd.
---
But-- --"
" He's the very man, ma'am."
---
" The man, truly!" said a third, with heartiness."

---
He's all there!"
---
Then will you tell him
---
the palpitation within his breast at discovering the well- known and admired, retired with him.

---
the
 men straggled on to the village in twos and threes--.
"
---
Oak
 and the bailiff being left by the rick alone
---
"?" inquired Gabriel.

---
" That I ca n't, indeed," he said,.
---
when he does

---
who showed this nervous dread of loving
 his neighbour as himself,
---
Oak
 walked on to the village, with Bathsheba, glad of his nearness to her, and
.
---
Obliged, to some extent, to forgo dreaming in order
 to find the way, he reached the churchyard, and.

---
Gabriel's footsteps were deadened by its softness, even
 at this indurating period of the year.
---
When abreast of
 a trunk to be the oldest of the old, he
 became aware that a figure was standing behind it.

---
Gabriel did not pause in his walk, and.
---
in another
 moment he accidentally kicked a loose stone
---
said Gabriel, heartily.

---
" Good- night." said the girl to Gabriel.

---
Gabriel resumed,,.

---
to be won by
 Gabriel's heartiness
---
as Gabriel had been won by her
 modulations
---
You are not a Weatherbury man?
---
Gabriel repeated, in a dull cadence
 of finality."
---
His thoughts were directed to the past, his
 eyes to the feet of the girl; and for the first time he
 saw lying there a bundle of some sort.
---
" said Oak.

---
" to have a cloak on such a cold night,"
 Gabriel observed.
---
he said.
---
Gabriel's fingers alighted on the young woman's wrist.

---
He had

---
Gabriel descended into the village of Weatherbury, or
 Lower Longpuddle as it was sometimes called.
---
He
 fancied.
---
that he had felt himself in the penumbra of a
 very deep sadness
---
Oak's hand skimmed the surface of the door with
 fingers.
---
till
 he found a leathern strap, which he pulled
---
A curved settle of unplaned oak
 stretched along one side, and.

---
This aged man was now sitting opposite the fire,.
---
his
 frosty white hair and beard overgrowing his gnarled
 figure like the grey moss and lichen upon a leafless
 apple- tree
---
He wore breeches and the laced- up shoes

---
called ankle- jacks; he kept his eyes.

---
Gabriel's nose was greeted by an atmosphere laden
 with the sweet smell of new malt.
---
The conversation
( to have been concerning the origin of the
 fire immediately ceased, and every one ocularly criticised
 him to the degree expressed by contracting the flesh of
 their foreheads and looking at him with narrowed eye-
 lids, as if he had been a light too strong for their sight.

---
his turning being as the turning of a rusty
 crane
---
That's never Gable Oak's grandson over at Nor-
 combe-- never
---
"!" he said, as a formula expressive of
 surprise, which nobody was supposed to take literally'.

---
" My father and my grandfather were old men of the
 name of Gabriel."
---
" Thought I knowed the man's face
---
as I seed him
 on the rick
---
said Mr. Oak.

---
when he was a child
---
Why, my boy Jacob there and your father were sworn
 brothers----
---
" Ay, sure." said his son, a young man about sixty-
 five, with a semi- bald head and one tooth in the left
 centre of his upper jaw, which made much of itself by
 standing prominent, like a milestone in a bank.
---
" But
" twas Joe had most to do with him.
---
the very man afore us
---
Billy, afore ye left Norcombe?"

---
Jacob's son Billy, a child
 of forty, or thereabouts,, and
 whose whiskers were assuming a chinchilla shade here
 and there
---
"" said Oak," as being a man in
 the place when I was quite a child."

---
Jacob stooped to the God- forgive- me,, but to the mind
 of any sensible drinker
---
any given toper feel ashamed of himself
---
when he sees
 its bottom in drinking it empty
---
Jacob, on receiving the order to see, placidly dipped his forefinger into it by
 way of thermometer, and.

---
because Shepherd Oak
 was a stranger
---
" No-- not at all," said Gabriel, in a reproving tone
 of considerateness.
---
Taking the
 mug he drank an inch or more from the depth of its
 contents, and.

---
duly passed it to the next man would n't think of giving such trouble to neighbours in
 washing up."
---
" A right sensible man." said Jacob.

---
observed a brisk
 young man-- Mark Clark by name, a genial and pleasant
 gentleman,.

---
you bain't a particular man we see,
 shepherd."

---
" True, true-- not at all." said the friendly Oak.

---
" Ah, he's his grandfer's own grandson!--
---
his grandfer
 were just such a nice unparticular man!"
---
" magnanimously said
 Jan Coggan, a person who held Saint- Simonian notions
 of share and share alike where liquor was concerned,.

---
as
 the vessel showed signs of approaching him in its gradual
 revolution among them
---
He was a man
 of more than middle age, with eyebrows high up in his
 forehead,.
---
that the law of the world
 was bad, with a long- suffering look through his listeners
 at the world
---
as it presented itself to his
 imagination
---
He always signed his name" Henery"--
 and
---
, he received the
 reply.

---
that " H- e- n- e- r- y" was the name he was christened
 and the name he would stick to-- in the tone of one
 to whom orthographical differences
---
Mr. Jan Coggan,,
 was a crimson man with a spacious countenance, and

---
private glimmer in his eye, whose name had appeared
 on the marriage register of Weatherbury and neighbour-
 as best man and chief witness in countless
 unions of the previous twenty years
---
ing parishes; he also very
 frequently filled the post of head godfather in baptisms
 of the subtly- jovial kind.

---
Jan.
" Ay" replied Mr.
 Clark, who, twenty years younger than Jan Coggan,
 revolved in the same orbit
---
He secreted mirth on all
 occasions for special discharge at popular parties.

---
" Why, Joseph Poorgrass, ye han't had a drop!"
---
said
 Mr. Coggan to a self- conscious man in the background,
.

---
as he is
---
All looked at Joseph Poorgrass with pitying reproach.
"
---
said Jan Coggan.

---
" Yes." continued Joseph Poorgrass-- his shyness,
 which was so painful as a defect,.
---
ye
 to be a very bashful man
---
"' Tis a' awkward gift for a man, poor soul." said the
 maltster.
---
" Ay ever since I was a boy.
---
And then I
 was put errand- man at the Women's Skittle Alley at the
 back of the Tailor's Arms in Casterbridge.'
---
" Ay, and he's very timid, too."
---
observed Jan Coggan.

---
Once he had been working late at Yalbury Bottom,
 and
---
as he was

---
continued Mr
 Coggan, with an impassive face,."
---
as he was coming along
 in the middle of the night
---
( Gabriel nodded)," and
---
Joseph, all
 in a tremble, said," Joseph Poorgrass, of Weatherbury,
 sir!"

---
said the timid
 man,.

---
that no man of a gentleman's rank would be

---
, Jan went on meditatively: --
"
---
And he's the fearfullest man, bain't
---
he would
---
knowing
, he kneeled down
---
" Ay." said Joseph,
---
I'm a
 lost man.
---
Gabriel broke the silence.
---
Gabriel's bosom thrilled gently.
  
---
as he
 thus slipped under the notice of the assembly the inner-
 most subject of his heart
---
Her uncle was took
 bad, and but
---
the doctor was called with his world- wide
 skill;
---
he could n't save the man.
---
Jan
 uncle was a very fair sort of man
---
Her
 uncle was a very fair sort of man.
---
who was his dairymaid
---
Well, a very good-
 hearted man were Farmer Everdene, and."
  
---
which
 would have been insulting the man's generosity -- --"
  
---
" True, Master Coggan,' twould so
---
" said Jacob.
---
that
 brought you no nearer to the horned man
---
" And did any of you know Miss Everdene's- father
 and mother?
---
Father, what sort of people were
 mis'ess' father and mother?"
  
---
" he was n't much to look
 at; but
---
He was fond enough
 of her as his sweetheart."
  
---
" observed Coggan.
  
---
He was very proud of her, too,."
---
" Ay." said Coggan."
---
He admired her so much that
 he used to light the candle three time a night to look
 at her."
  
---
who habitually
 spoke on a large scale in his moral reflections
---
" Well, to be sure." said Gabriel.
  
---
I knowed the man and
 woman both well.
---
that was the man's
 name, sure."
---
he were
 of a higher circle of life than that--'
---
And he became
 a very celebrated bankrupt two or three times."
  
---
he was quite a common man
---
said
 Joseph.
  
---
O no, no! That man failed for heaps of money
---
, Mr. Coggan,
 after absently scrutinising a coal, took up the narrative, with a private twirl of
 his eye:--
  "
---
he could n't help it.
---
The poor
 feller were faithful and true enough to her in his wish,
 but
---
his heart would rove,.
---
what he would
---
He spoke
 to me in real tribulation about it once."
---
he said," but
---
he cured it by making her
 take off her wedding- ring and calling her by her maiden
 name as they sat together after the shop was shut, and
 so' a would get to fancy she was only his sweetheart, and
 not married to him at all
---
as he could

---
thoroughly fancy he was doing wrong and
---
, he might have gone the bad road and

---
The man's will was
, but
---
his heart did n't chime in
---
He got so much better,,
---
that he was quite godly
 in his later years
---
" was n't he, Jan?" said Joseph Poor-
 grass.
---
" He got and
---
himself confirmed over again in a more
 serious way,
---
he liked.
---
He used, too,; and
---
he kept a
 missionary box upon his table; yes, and."
  
---
he would- box the charity-
 boys' ears,
---
" Ay, at that time he thought of nothing but high
 things."
---
" One day Parson Thirdly
 met him and."
---
when he seed a parson-
  "
---
A queer Christian, like the Devil's head in a cowl,
  " He is."
---
that man would as soon tell a lie Sundays as
 working- days--
---
"" said Gabriel.
  
---
the man of bitter moods, looking
 round upon the company with the antithetic laughter
 that comes from a keener appreciation of the miseries
 of life than ordinary men are capable of
---
Gabriel thought fit to change the subject.
---
You
 must be a very aged man, malter,
---
" to have mild and ancient" he remarked.
  
---
And he growled.

---
terrible
 crooked too, lately" Jacob continued,
---
to hear the pedigree of yer
 life, father would n't ye, shepherd?
  " Ay that I should.
---
"" said Gabriel with the heartiness
 of a man who had longed to hear it for several months.

---
The maltster cleared his throat in an exaggerated
 form for emphasis, and!
---
years afore you were thought of, Master Oak"
---
( Oak smiled
 sincere belief in the fact).
---
" Then I malted at Dur-
 nover four year, and four year turnip- hoeing; and
 I was fourteen times eleven months at Millpond St.
 Jude's"( nodding north- west- by- north).
---
" O no, father!" said Jacob.
---
"" said Gabriel, soothingly.
  
---
Jan
 must have a wonderful talented constitution, must n't he, neighbours?"
  
---
The maltster, being know pacified, was even generous
 enough to voluntarily disparage in a slight degree the
 virtue of having lived a great many years, by mentioning
 that the cup they were drinking out of was three years
 older than he.
  
---
, the end of
 Gabriel Oak's flute became visible over his smock- frock

---
" said Gabriel.
---
" Neither drum nor trumpet." said Jan Coggan.
---
" said Gabriel,.
---
Oak then struck up" Jockey to the Fair." and.
  "
---
He can blow the flute very well-- that' a can."
---
said
 a young married man,."
---
He
 continued,
---
" He's a clever man, and."
---
murmured Joseph Poorgrass, in
 a soft cadence.
---
that he's not a player of ba'dy songs' instead of these
 merry tunes
---
for God
 to have made the shepherd a loose low man-- a man of
 iniquity,-- as what he is
---
it to be of any conse-
 quence to his opinion
---
that he had only heard about a
 word and three- quarters of what Joseph had said
---
" Yes." added Joseph,;" for evil."
  
---
whitest shirted man as in the raggedest tramp upon the
 turnpike,
---
as he
 entered upon his second tune
---
yer eyes a- staring out like a strangled man's
---
" ee
 blowing into the flute to be the same man
 were scrimped
 up and--
 just as they be now."
  
---
a man
 look such a scarecrow
---
"' Tis a pity." observed Mr. Mark Clark, with
 additional criticism of Gabriel's countenance
---
you do n't mind that young man's bad
 manners in naming your features
---
said Mr. Oak.
  
---
" For by nature ye be a very handsome man,
 shepherd."
---
continued Joseph Poorgrass, with winning
 sauvity.
  
---
said Oak, in the modest
 tone.
  
---
that
 he would never let; in this severe showing a discretion equal to that
 related to its sagacious inventress, the divine Minerva
 herself
---
him playing the
 flute
---
It came from the old man in the
 background.
  
---
barely atoned for by the occasional chuckle he con-

---
" O no, no." said Gabriel.
  
---
" said Susan Tall's
 husband, the young married man who had spoken once
 before.
---
inquired Coggan.

---
said Susan Tall's husband,
 in a tone intended to imply his habitual reception of
 jokes without minding them at all.  
---
The young man
 then wished them good- night and.
  
---
Then Gabriel
 arose and.
---
Flourishing his finger ominously
 he threw a gaze teeming with tidings just-- where his eye
 alighted by accident, which happened to be in Joseph
 Poorgrass's face.
  "
---
O-- what's the matter, what's the matter, Henery?"
 said Joseph,.
  
---
he owned to having carried off five sack altogether, upon
.
---
Well, he's turned
 out neck and crop, and
---
Before
 he had replaced it on the table,
---
in came the young man,
 Susan Tall's husband, in a still greater hurry.
  "
---
" Or' tis her father's razor!" suggested Billy Smallbury,
 with a vivid sense of detail.
  
---
whom neither news, fire,
 rain, nor thunder could draw from his hole
---
he sat down again and
.
  
---
Are any of my men among you
---
said Susan Tall's husband.
  
---
if
 he had been a respectable lad
---
said Jacob,.
---
he's a soldier
---
" Do you know his name?"
---
which man it is, and

---
I ca n't speak of him now."
  
---
That night at Coggan's, Gabriel Oak, beneath the
 screen of closed eyelids, was busy with fancies, and full
 of movement, like a river flowing rapidly under its ice.

---
they possibly did
 with Oak to- night, for the delight of merely seeing her
 effaced for the time his perception of the great differ-
 ence between seeing and possessing.
  
---
He also thought of Plans for fetching his few utensils
 and books from Norcombe.
---
The Young Man's Best
 Companion, The Farrier's Sure Guide, The Veterinary
 Surgeon, Paradise Lost, The Pilgrim's Progress, Robinson
 Crusoe, Ash's Dictionary, the Walkingame's Arithmetic,
 constituted his library; and
---
though a limited series, it was
 one from which he had acquired more sound informa-
 tion by diligent perusal than many a man of opportunities
 has done from a furlong of laden shelves.





---
By daylight, the Bower of Oak's new- found mistress,
 Bathsheba Everdene, presented itself as a hoary build-
.

---
, the main staircase to which was of hard oak, the
 balusters, heavy as bed- posts,
---
wherever-
 he went
---
" To ride up the footpath like that! Why did n't he
 stop at the gate? Lord!'
---
I see the
 top of his hat."
 
---
" Why does n't Mrs. Coggan go to the door?"
---
Rat- tat- tat- tat, resounded more decisively from Bath-
 sheba's oak.
  
---
" There-- Mrs. Coggan is going!"
---
"" said Mrs. Coggan, and in a minute
.
  
---
I ca n't see him in this state
---
"
   said Mrs. Coggan,
 critically.
  
---
I ca n't see him
---
Mrs. Coggan went downstairs, and."
  
---
the other men be."
  
---
Who is Mr. Boldwood?"
---
" How old is he?"
  
---
" Why should he inquire about Fanny?"
  
---
" Oh, because,,
 he took her and.
---
He's a very kind man
 that way, but Lord-- there!"
  
---
He's been courted by sixes and sevens-- all the girls,
 gentle and simple,
---
Jane
 Perkins worked at him for two months like a slave,
 and
---
the two Miss Taylors spent a year upon him,
 and; but Lord--
."
  
---
he cost Farmer Ives's daughter nights of tears
 and twenty pounds' worth of new clothes
---
A little boy came up at this moment and.
---
He always had a loosened tooth or
 a cut finger to show to particular friends, which he did
 with an air of being thereby elevated above the common
 herd of afflictionless humanity-- to which exhibition
 of congratulation as well as pity.
  
---
"" said Master Coggan in a
 scanning measure.
  
---
He gave it to me for opening
 the gate."
  
---
What did he say?
---
""
  " He said"?'"

---
and he said,
"
---
" Cause he gave me the penny!"
  
---
But what between the poor
 men I wo n't have, and
---
A man wanted to once."
---
" And you would n't have
 him?"
  
---
" He was n't quite good enough for me."
  
---
And did you love
 him,?"
  
---
" Oh, no. But I rather liked him."
  
---
A crooked file of men was
.
---
that her men had all deposited themselves on
 a long form and a settle at the lower extremity
---
Now before I begin, men."
---
The men breathed an audible breath of amazement.
  
---
I met Farmer Boldwood.
---
I went with him and two of his men, and, but
---
but he's not.
---
He
 promised."
  
---
he'll be in directly
---
" I be the personal name of Poorgrass."
  
---
Henery Fray,, lifted his eyebrows and fingers.
  
---
he had

---
Now-the next-- Andrew
 Randle, you are a new man
---
' A's a stammering man, mem."
---
they turned him away
---
he ever did speak plain
---
because the
 only time he said
---
his soul was
 his own, and other iniquities, to the squire
---
Joseph Poorgrass, in the background twitched, and

---
his lips became dry with fear of some terrible conse-
 quences,.
  
---
as he saw Bathsheba summarily, and

---
" For you or anybody, ma'am,"
 replied the young married man.
  "
---
True-- the man must live!
---
I be his lawful wife!
---
Yes, he'll stay, ma'am!
---
Well, he can speak for himself
---
for he was

" The new shepherd will want a man under him,"

---
" Oh-- he will.
---
Who can he have?"
  
---
" Young Cain Ball is a very good lad."
---
Shepherd Oak do n't mind his youth
---
he added,
.
  
---
with his arms folded

"" said Gabriel.
  
---
" How did Cain come by such a name?"
---
made a mistake at his christening,
, and.'
---
twas Abel killed Cain
---
brought up by a very heathen father and mother, who
 never sent her to church or school, and
---
Mr. Fray here drew up his features to the mild degree
 of melancholy.
  "
---
Very well then, Cainey Ball to be under- shepherd

---
said
 Shepard Oak from the doorpost.
---
"" Gabriel was rather staggered by the remark-
 able coolness of her manner.
---
he stood
---
that Oak and
 the handsome woman before whom had ever
 been other than strangers
---
When, in the
 writings of the later poets, Jove and his family are found
 to have moved from their cramped quarters on the peak
 of Olympus into the wide sky above it, their words show
 a proportionate increase of arrogance and reserve.

" he said,"."
---
He then stamped with
 each foot severely, and.

on looking down his boots were

as is his nature to, and

Gabriel had listened with interest.

" Yes." continued William

Fanny's young man was one of the
 regiment, and

Gabriel remained musing and.

, for he
 was in doubt

The throw was the idea of a man conjoined with the
 execution of a woman.
---
No man,
 rabbit, or squirrel in his childhood, could possibly have
.

---
Nothing was heard in reply to the signal but
 the gurgle and cluck of one of these invisible wheels--
 together with a few small sounds which a sad man
 would have called moans, and a happy man laughter--
 caused by the flapping of the waters against trifling
 objects in other parts of the stream.

---
Is it Sergeant Troy?
---
there was a mannerin the man
 which is rarely a husband's.
---
The low though extensive hall,, was thronged with hot men who talked among
 each other in twos and threes, the speaker of the minute
 looking sideways into his auditor's face and concentrating
 his argument by a contraction of one eyelid during de-
 livery.
---
each subjected
 his sapling to great varieties of usage
---
During conversations-- bending it round
 his back, forming an"arch of it between his two hands,
 overweighting it on the ground till it reached nearly a
 semicircle;.

---
Something in the exact arch of her upper unbroken
 row of teeth, and in the keenly pointed corners of her
 red mouth to argue a point with a
 tall man, suggested.
---
The other man would then shake his head.

---
If everybody, this man included
---
He was a gentlemanly man, with full and
 distinctly outlined Roman features,
---
He was erect in attitude, and quiet in
 demeanour.
---
Apparently he had
---
at which a man's aspect naturally
 ceases; and,
 artificially
---
Thirty- five and
 fifty were his limits of variation
---
-- he might have been
 either, or anywhere between the two.

---
that married men of forty are usually
 ready and generous enough to fling passing glances at
 any specimen of moderate beauty
---
that this unmoved person
 was not a married man
---
" But there was one man who had more sense than
 to waste his time upon me.
---
Do you know at all who he could be?"

---
" I haven't a notion; besides,' tis no difference, since
 he took less notice of you than any of the rest.
---
if he'd taken more
---
Why, there he is!
---
That's Farmer Boldwood--
 of course' tis-- the man you could n't see the other day
 when he called.
---
"
" Oh, Farmer Boldwood." murmured Bathsheba, and
.
---
as he outstripped them
---
" He's an interesting man--
---
why he is so wrapt up and indifferent, and

---
seemingly so far away from all he sees around him,"

---
that he met
 with some bitter disappointment
---
when he was a young
 man and merry
---
it is simply his nature
---
" Simply his nature-- I expect so,-- nothing else
 in the world."

---
he has been served
 cruelly, poor thing'
---
Perhaps, after all, he has!
---
he has
---
, he has
---
he must have
---
what's the
 matter with him
---
" Did you notice Mr. Boldwood's doings in church
 this morning
---
His pew is exactly opposite yours,
---
" And you did not see his goings on!,"

---
" What did he do?
---
should he?
---
" I did n't ask him to.

---
he did n't.
---
Rich and
 gentlemanly, what does he care?"

---
It is only for little Teddy Coggan.

---
this will be a pretty
 surprise for him.
---
It just suits itself to a chubby-
 faced child like him."
---
how he would wonder
---
Boldwood's had begun a
 species of Daniel in her kingdom who persisted in
 kneeling eastward.
---
that he might just as well follow suit with the
 rest, and
---
Still,
 it was faintly depressing that the most dignified and
 valuable man in the parish
---
should withhold his eyes,
 and.
---
He would n't see any humour
 in it."

---
" He'd worry to death."
---
" He's rather a naughty
 child sometimes."

---
that he is
---
as men do
---
Open, Boldwood-- shut, Teddy.
---
Open, Teddy-- shut,
 Boldwood."

---
till the large red seal became as a blot of blood
 on the retina of his eye
---
as he ate and
---
he
 still read in fancy the words thereon,--
"
---
although they
 were too remote for his sight
---
Here, in the quiet of Boldwood's parlour,
 where the atmosphere was that of a Puritan all the week,.

---
Since the receipt of the missive in the morning,
 Boldwood had felt the symmetry of his existence to
.
---
Boldwood, of course,
 did not know.
---
And such an explanation did not
 strike him as a possibility even.
---
When Boldwood went to bed
---
he placed the valen-
 tine in the corner of the looking- glass.
---
He was
 conscious of its presence,.
---
even when his back was
 turned upon it
---
It was the first time in Boldwood's
 life that such an event had occurred.
---
him to think it
---
The same
 fascination an act prevented him from regarding it as
 an impertinence.
---
He looked again at the direction.

---
bearing his name; her unrevealed eyes had

---
watched every curve; her brain had
 seen him in imagination the while.
---
Whenever Boldwood dozed
---
when he awoke there

---
His window admitted only a
 reflection of its rays, and
---
The substance of the epistle had occupied him but
 little in comparison with the fact of its arrival.
---
He
 suddenly wondered.
---
if anything more might be found in
 the envelope than what he had withdrawn
---
He jumped
 out of bed in the weird light,.

---
Boldwood looked,: "."
---
as he
 had a hundred times the preceding day, at the insistent red
 seal
---
he said aloud.

---
In doing
 so he caught sight of his reflected features, wan in
 expression, and insubstantial in form.
---
He saw.
---
that his eyes
 were wide- spread and vacant
---
Feeling uneasy and dis-
 satisfied with himself for this nervous excitability, he
 returned to bed.

---
when Boldwood arose and
---
He
 descended the stairs and
---
over which he paused and
.

---
Boldwood was listlessly noting
---
A half- muffled noise of light wheels interrupted
 him.
---
Boldwood turned back into the road.
---
Boldwood seized it and
---
" said the man, when
 he saw Boldwood's action.
---
Boldwood looked then at the address--
 To the New Shepherd,
 Weatherbury Farm,
 Near Casterbridge.

---
The
 tall form was that of Gabriel Oak; the small one that
 of George; the articles in course of transit were hurdles.

---
" Wait," said Boldwood.
---
" That's the man on the hill.

---
I'll take the letter to him myself."

---
Exhibiting a
 face pregnant with intention, he entered the snowy field.

---
Gabriel, at that minute, descended the hill towards
 the right.
---
touched the distant roof of Warren's Malthouse
:   Boldwood
 followed at a distance.





---
The maltster, after having lain down in his clothes
 for a few hours, was now sitting beside a three- legged
 table, breakfasting of bread and bacon.
---
He had been without
 them for so many years.
---
Indeed,
 he seemed,
.

---
as he got nearer
---
if he would ever reach it at all
---
introductory matter being often
 omitted in this neighbourhood, both from word and
 deed, and the maltster having the same latitude allowed
 him
---
He picked up a fragment
 of cheese, by pecking upon it with his knife, as a butcher
.

---
Matthew Moon, Joseph Poorgrass, and other carters
 and waggoners followed at his heels, with great lanterns
 dangling from their hands,.
"
---
Henery shook his head, and.

---
he said".
---
Benjy
 Pennyways were not a true man or an honest baily--
 as big a betrayer as Judas Iscariot himself
---
He allowed.
---
his head to swing
 laterally three or four times in silence
---
; Henery meanwhile
 retained several marks of despair upon his face,.

---
directly
 he should go on speaking
---
, when I think o' it,
 I sorrows like a man in travel!"

---
" said Joseph
 Poorgrass in a voice of thorough attestation, and with
 a wire- drawn smile of misery.

---
' Twould do a martel man no harm.
---
" to have" said Billy Smallbury, who had just
 entered, bearing his one tooth before him.
---
attested
 Joseph Poorgrass.

---
her old uncle's things were not good
 enough for her
---
Mr.
 Oak appeared in the entry with a steaming face,
---
hay-
 bands wound about his ankles, a
 leather strap round his waist outside the smock- frock,
 and looking altogether an epitome of the world's health
 and vigour.
---
Four lambs hung in various embarrassing
 attitudes over his shoulders, and
---
whom
 Gabriel had contrived
---
" Well, Shepherd Oak, and how's lambing this year?" inquired Joseph Poorgrass.

---
"," said Oak.
---
Joseph remarked.

---
" said Gabriel,
---
as he was bidden
---
Oak lowered
 the lambs from their unnatural elevation,.

---
" to have at
 Norcombe" said Gabriel," and' tis such a plague to bring
 the weakly ones to a house.
---
" Sit down, Shepherd Oak," continued the ancient man
 of malt."
---
" These middle- aged men have been pulling her over
 the coals for pride and vanity."
---
The gallant Mark Clark here made a peculiar and well
 known sound with his own.

---
said
 Oak, turning to Joseph Poorgrass with a very grim
 look.

---
said Joseph,."
---
though one of the quietest and most gentle
 men on earth, rose to the occasion, with martial
 promptness and vigour
---
Here he
 placed his fist, rather smaller in size than a common
 loaf, in the mathemarical centre of the maltster's little
 table, and.
---
before he went further
---
" Now-- the
 first man in the parish prophesying bad of
 our mistress, why"( here the fist was raised and--
---
as T'hor might have done with his hammer in assaying
 it
---
let fall
)" he'll smell and
---
though he understood English
 but
---
that ye be a extraordinary good and
 clever man, shepherd
---
"" said Joseph Poorgrass with
 considerable anxiety from behind the maltster's bed-
 stead whither he had retired for safety.
---
he added,.
---
" said Matthew Moon, with
 a small anxious laugh towards Oak,.

---
how very
 friendly disposed he was likewise
---
said Oak.

---
"" said Gabriel, as a
 man of medium sentiments on the subject.

---
for ye to be such a clever man
---
Joseph Poorgrass used?"
---
Joseph shook his head
---
how absolute was the fact that he could n't."
---
Matthew marked on the dusty floor with his
 whip- handle.

---
would n't he, Joseph,
---
a seed his name
 looking so inside- out- like
---
" said Joseph, meekly.
---
"' Tis a bad afiction for ye, being such a man of
 calamities in other ways."

---
" owning" said Oak,
 frankly.
---
" Oak drew a slow breath.

---
Their noise increased to a
 chorus of baas, upon which Oak pulled the milk- can from
 before the fire, and.

---
resumed Joseph Poorgrass,.

---
his
 eyes lingering on the operations of Oak with the neces-
 sary melancholy
---
" said Gabriel.

---
" O no-- not at all." replied Gabriel, hastily, and
---
a
 sigh escaped him,.

---
Boldwood entered the malthouse,
.
" Ah!
---
he said.
---
" O yes-- not a bit of difference, Mr. Boldwood--
 not a bit." said Gabriel, readily.
---
He had not a corre-
 spondent on earth, nor.

---
was there a possible letter coming
 to him
---
Oak stepped aside, and
---
I am happy to say I am going to be married to
 the young man who has courted me for some time-- Sergeant
 Troy, of the11th Dragoon Guards, now quartered in this
 town.
---
He would, object to my having received
 anything except as a loan, being a man of great respecta-
 bility and high honour-- indeed, a nobleman by blood.
 
---
"" said Gabriel;
"
---
Boldwood read the letter and.

---
What sort of a man is this Sergeant Troy?"
---
" said
 Gabriel.

---
though
 he's a clever fellow, and up to everything
---
A slight
 romance attaches to him, too.
---
Unfortunately for her boy, his best friends died;
 and
---
he got then a situation as second clerk at a lawyer's
 in Casterbridge.
---
He stayed there for some time, and
.
---
had he not indulged in the wild freak of
 enlisting
---
from which
 he coughed with noisy vigour and great distension of face
---
" Now, Cain Ball." said?
---
-- that's Shepherd Oak."

---
said Oak,.
---
" You are
 a good boy, and
---
Oak took from his illimitable pockets a marking iron,
 imprintcd on the buttocks
 of the infant sheep the initials of her
---
he delighted to
 muse on--" B. E.." which signified to all the region
 round that henceforth the lambs belonged to Farmer
 Bathsheba Everdene, and to no one else.
"
---
" The shepherd lifted the
 sixteen large legs and four small bodies he had
---
himself
 brought, and.

---
Boldwood followed him a little way up the field,
.
---
He followed him again
 with a last resolve,.
---
On approaching
 the nook, the farmer
 drew out- his pocket- book, unfastened- it, and.
---
it
 to lie open on his hand
---
" to ask you, Oak" he said, with unreal
 carelessness,"?"

---
Oak glanced into the book, and."

---
Oak had coloured simply at the consciousness of
 sounding her name.
---
He now felt a strangely distressing
 qualm from a new thought."
---
Boldwood mistook his confusion:  sensitive persons

---
" he returned-- and

---
there was something incongruous in the serious earnest-
 ness with which he applied himself to an argument on
 a valentine.
---
Soon parting from Gabriel, the lonely and reserved
 man returned to his house to breakfast--.
---
He again
 placed the letter on the mantelpiece, and.





---
A young
 cavalry soldier in a red uniform, with the three chevrons
 of a sergeant upon his sleeve, strode up the aisle, with
 an embarrassment which was only the more marked
 by the intense vigour of his step, and by the deter-
 mination upon his face to show none.
---
A slight flush
 had mounted his cheek by the time he had run the
 gauntlet between these women; but,
---
passing on through
 the chancel arch, he never paused.
---
till he came close
 to the altar
---
Here for a moment he stood
 alone.

---
who had not yet doffed his
 surplice,
---
He whispered to the soldier,
 and
---
who in his turn
 whispered to an elderly woman, apparently his wife, and

---
He faced the south-
 east, and.

---
as he was still
---
There he stood, his face to
 the south- east, upright as a column, his cap in his hand.

---
he appeared.
---
he did turn, and
,,
 with a compressed lip
---
The young man on leaving
 the door went.
---
when, in the middle,
 he met a little woman
---
The expression of her face,
, sank at the
 sight of his nearly to terror.

---
Well?" he said, in a suppressed passion.

---
and he gave vent to a hoarse laugh.

---
" he said,
---
IN THE MARKET- PLACE


 ON Saturday Boldwood was in Casterbridge market
 house as usual,.
---
when the disturber of his dreams entered
 and
---
Adam had awakened from
 his deep sleep, and behold!
---
Boldwood looked at her-- not slily, critically, or
 understandingly, but blankly at gaze, in the way.
---
a
 reaper looks up at a passing train-- as something foreign
 to his element, and but
---
whether
 their orbits were as geometrical, unchangeable, and
 as subject to laws as his own, or
---
comets of such uncertain
 aspect, movement, and permanence, that as absolutely erratic
, he had not deemed it
 his duty
---
He saw her black hair, her correct facial curves
 and profile, and the roundness of her chin and throat.

---
He saw then the side of her eyelids, eyes, and lashes,
 and the shape of her ear.
---
Next he noticed her figure,
 her skirt, and the very soles of her shoes.

---
Boldwood thought her beautiful, but.
---
whether he was right in his thought,
---
for it seemed
 impossible that this romance in the flesh, if so sweet
 as he imagined, could have been going on long without
 creating a commotion of delight among men, and pro-
 voking more inquiry than Bathsheba had done, even
 though that was not a little
---
To the best of his judge-
 ment neither nature nor art could improve this perfect
 one of an imperfect many.
---
His heart began.
---
though
 forty years of age, had never before inspected a woman
 with the very centre and force of his glance
---
; they had
 struck upon all his senses at wide angles.

---
He could not assure
 himself.
---
that his opinion was true even now
---
He fur-
"

---
A man is never more credulous than in receiving
 favourable opinions on the beauty of a woman he is
 half, or quite, in love with
---
Boldwood was
 satisfied now.

---
Boldwood's blindness to the difference
 between approving of, and
 originating, was.

---
But Boldwood grew
 hot down to his hands with an incipient jealousy
---
" His first impulse was.
---
Boldwood renounced the idea.
---
He could not make
 the request

if
 he thought

if he

him to woo her

CHAPTER XVIII



 BOLDWOOD IN MEDITATION-- REGRET


.
---
BOLDWOOD was tenant of what was called Little
 Weatherbury Farm, and
---
his person was the nearest ap-
 proach to aristocracy that this remoter quarter of the
 parish could boast of
---
only Mr. Boldwood going out for the day
---
His house stood, and
---
Pacing up and down at the heels of the animals was
 Farmer Boldwood himself.
---
This place was his almonry
 and cloister in one:  here,.

---
after looking to the feeding
 of his four- footed dependants, the celibate would walk
 and
---
His square- framed perpendicularity showed more fully
 now than in the crowd and bustle of the market- house.

---
In this meditative walk his foot met the floor with heel
 and
---
his fine reddish- fleshed face
 was bent downwards just enough to render obscure the
 still mouth and.
---
A few clear and thread- like horizontal
 lines were the only interruption to the otherwise smooth
 surface of his large forehead.

---
The phases of Boldwood's life were ordinary enough,
 but
---
his was not an ordinary nature.
---
which struck casual observers more than anything else
 in his character and habit
---
His equilibrium disturbed.
---
,
 he was in extremity at once
---
If an emotion possessed
 him at all
---
, it ruled him
---
a feeling not mastering him

---
He was always hit mortally, or
---
he was missed.

---
He had no light and careless touches in his constitu-
 tion, either for good or for evil.
---
Stern in the outlines of
 action, mild in the details, he was serious throughout all.

---
He saw no absurd sides to the follies of life, and.
---
thus,
 though not quite companionable in the eyes of merry
 men and scoffers, and those to whom all things show
 life
---
as a jest, he was not intolerable to the earnest and
 those acquainted with grief
---
a man-who read
 all the dramas of life seriously,
---
if he failed
---
what
 Boldwood was
---
; for to form guesses concerning his wild capa-
 bilities from old floodmarks faintly visible, he had never
 been seen at the high tides which caused them.

---
Farmer Boldwood came to the stable- door and.
---
Boldwood, looking into the distant meadows, saw
 there three figures.
---
When Bathsheba's figure shone upon the farmer's
 eyes it lighted him up.
---
A man's body is; or the tablet, of
 his soul, as he is reserved or ingenuous, overflowing or
 self- contained.
---
There was a  change in Boldwood's
 exterior from its former impassibleness; and
---
his face
 showed.

---
that he was now living outside his defences
 for the first time, and with a fearful sense of exposure
---
At last he arrived at a conclusion.
---
The insulation of his heart by reserve during these
 many years, without a channel of any kind for disposable
 emotion, had worked its effect.
---
Boldwood was a living testimony to
 the truth of the proposition.
---
He became.

---
He approached the gate of the meadow.
---
Gabriel
 had skinned the dead lamb, and.

---
where he
 was overhung by a willow tree in full bloom
---
He also turned and.

---
Bold-
 wood had shown him
---
At onee connecting these signs with the letter, Gabriel suspected her of some
 coquettish procedure begun by that means, and
---
, he knew not how.

---
Farmer Boldwood had read the pantomime denoting
 that they were aware of his presence, and
---
the perception
 was as too much light turned upon his new sensibility.

---
He was still in the road, and
---
by moving on he hoped
.
---
that he had originally
 intended
---
He passed by with an
 utter and overwhelming sensation of ignorance, shyness,
 and doubt.
---
Perhaps in her manner there were signs
 that she wished to see him-- perhaps not
---
-- he could not
 read a woman.
---
Every turn, look, word, and accent
 contained a mystery quite distinct from its obvious
 import, and not one had ever been pondered by him
 until now.

---
BOLDWOOD did eventually call upon her.
---
" he murmured.
---
In con-
 templating Bathsheba as a woman, he had forgotten the
 accidents of her position as an agriculturist--
---
that being
 as much of a farmer, and as extensive a farmer, as
 himself, her probable whereabouts was out- of- doors at
 this time of the year.
---
This, and the other oversights
 Boldwood was guilty of,.
---
Thus a mild sort of
 apotheosis took place in his fancy,.

---
He had by this time
---
grown used to being in
 love; the passion now startled him less, and
---
even when it
 tortured him more
---
he felt himself adequate to the
 situation.
---
he went off

---
Boldwood went.
---
Shepherd Oak, Jan Coggan, Moon, Poor-
 grass, Cain Ball, and several others were assembled
 here,
---
The meek sheep
 were pushed into the pool by Coggan and Matthew
 Moon, who stood by the lower hatch,; then Gabriel, who stood on the brink, thrust
 them under as they swam along, with an instrument
 like a crutch, formed for the purpose, and also for
 assisting the exhausted animals when the wool became
 saturated and they began to sink.
---
Cainy Ball and Joseph,
, were if possible
 wetter than the rest
---
Boldwood came close and
---
he had

---
Boldwood seemed determined, and.
---
His tone was
---
Boldwood told everything in
 that word.

---
" he said, with a
 solemn simplicity.
---
he went on.
---
I had never any views of myself
 as a husband in my earlier days, nor
---
that Boldwood had as yet
 kept closed
---
" he exclaimed, in
 a low voice.
---
why he thought
---
that,
 far from being a conceited assumption on Boldwood's
 part, it was but the natural conclusion of serious reflec-
 tion based on deceptive premises of her own offering
---
", Mr. Boldwood--
 certainly I must say that."
---
if you can not bear with me as a husband
---
The dairy superintendence shall be done by
 a man
---
; to the
 chaise, because it is he same my poor father and mother
 drove, but
---
it swelled with
 sympathy for the deep- natured man who spoke so
 simply.
  
---
he said earnestly and
 gratefully.
---
" he said.

---
Boldwood dropped his
 gaze to the ground, and.
---
where he was
---
Realities then returned upon him
 like the pain of a wound received in an excitement
 which eclipses it, and
---
he, too, then went on.





---
" HE is so disinterested and kind to offer me all that I
 can desire."
---
Yet Farmer Boldwood, whether by nature kind or
 the reverse to kind, did not exercise kindness, here.

---
He was close
 to her doors
---
: his standing was sufficient
---
: his qualities
 were even supererogatory.
---
Boldwood as
 a means to marriage was unexceptionable
---
that ordinary men take wives
---
Cainy Ball turned the handle of Gabriel's grindstone,
.
---
his head performing a melancholy see- saw up and down
 with each turn of the wheel
---
Oak stood somewhat: his figure slightly bent
---
as
 Eros is represented when in the act of sharpening his
 arrows
---
, the weight of his body
 thrown over on the shears, and
---
his head balanced side-
 ways, with a critical compression of the lips and contrac-
 tion of the eyelids.

---
His mistress came up and
---
Cain departed, and
---
Gabriel had glanced up in intense surprise,.
---
Gabriel applied the shears.

---
Gabriel turned.
---
if the men made any observa-
 tions on my going behind the sedge with Mr. Boldwood
 yesterday
---
" said Gabriel.
---
He relinquished the winch, and
---
times slap a child's hand in teaching him to write)
---
" Incline the edge so,"
 he said.
  
---
as he spoke
---
Gabriel freed her hands quietly, and
---
Did the men think it odd
---
Gabriel looked incredulous and sad, but
---
Oak, stopping the
 handle, and
---
if Mr. Boldwood really spoke of
 marriage
---
he
 did n't to please you
---
-- his tone being ambiguous
---
Gabriel
 bitterly, and going on
 with his turning, his words rising and falling in a
 regular swell and cadence as he stooped or rose with
 the winch, which directed them, according to his
 position, perpendicularly into the earth, or horizontally
 along the garden, his eyes being fixed on a leaf upon
 the ground
---
At this period the
 single opinion in the parish on herself and her doings
 was Gabriel
 Oak's.
---
And the outspoken honesty of his character
 was such-
---
Thoroughly convinced of the
 impossibility of his own suit, a high resolve constrained
.
---
him not to injure that of another
---
Knowing he would reply truly
---
Gabriel did
---
on that account Gabriel had

---
He said nothing.

---
Not by any means." said Gabriel quietly.
---
Whatever Gabriel felt
---
, he coolly echoed her words--
"
---
that he was loving her at the same time
---
He had not finished, either.
---
He
 continued in a more agitated voice:--
.
---
Leading on a
 man is not a praiseworthy action.

---
And even, Miss Everdene, if you seriously inclined
 towards him, you might have let not by sending
 him a valentine's letter."

---
him find it out in
 some way of true loving- kindness, and
---
" I can not allow any man to-- to criticise my private
 Conduct!
---
" said Gabriel calmly.
---
He had
 been held to her by a beautiful thread which it pained
 him to spoil by breaking, rather than by a chain
---
he
 could not break.
---
" he added.

---
his, though never meeting them
---
And he took his shears and.





---
" Sixty!" said Joseph Poorgrass.

---
" Fifty- nine!" said Susan Tall's husband.
"
---
" said Joseph Poorgrass.

---
" said Joseph.

---
Joseph's countenance was drawn into lines and
 puckers by his concern.
---
his face were rigid.
---
his eyes turned whichever way."
---
said Joseph," and
---
Tis
 nothing but Corinthians and Thessalonians in this
 danged Testament.":" Joseph," he said,"
---
All the ancient men ran in a jumbled throng after
 her to the clover- field.

---
, Joseph sinking down in the
 midst when about half- way, like an individual withering
 in a world which was more and more insupportable
---
" Only one man in the neighbourhood knows the way,"

---
He could cure'em
 all."

---
if he were here
---
Who is he?
---
's get him
---
" Ah, he's a clever
 man in talents!"

---
, that he is so
---
" Ah!" said Joseph Poorgrass.

---
True-- he's the man."
---
Farmer Boldwood knows
---
Two of his store
 ewes got into some vetches t'other day, and.
---
He sent a man on horseback here
---
" Ay-- a holler pipe." echoed Joseph.
---
" Never will I send for him never!
---
" I wo n't send for him.

---
" Where is Oak staying?"

---
he
 must return instantly--
---
He diminished down the
 hill.

---
to which
 Gabriel had retired before taking his final departure
 from the locality
---
The men entered the field and
.
---
Gabriel was not visible anywhere.

---
" Perhaps he is already gone!
---
" He says."
---
Joseph
 Poorgrass retired a few steps behind a hurdle.

---
He says."

---
he shall not come
---
" Oh, oh, that's his answer!
---
Where does he get his
 airs?
---
Shall
 I beg to a man who has begged to me?"

---
The men looked grave,.

---
I'm sure he'd come then.
---
Gable is a true man in that
 way."

---
" And he drives me
---
to do what n't;
 yes, he does!
---
Gabriel
 was not angry
---
: he was simply neutral,.
---
the rider
 turning his face in receding
---
Gabriel looked at her.

---
O, Gabriel, how could you serve me so unkindly!"
 Such a tenderly- shaped reproach for his previous
 delay
---
was the one speech in the language that he could
 pardon for not being commendation of his readiness
 now.

---
Gabriel murmured a confused reply, and.
---
which sentence in her
 note had brought him
---
Gabriel was already among the turgid, prostrate forms.

---
He had flung off his coat,.

---
Gabriel began.

---
Passing his hand over the sheep's left flank, and
 selecting the proper point, he punctured the skin and
 rumen with the lance
---
; then he
 suddenly withdrew the lance,.
---
Owing to the great hurry
,
 Gabriel missed his aim in one case, and.
---
When the love- led man had ceased from his labours
---
Gabriel, will you stay on with me?
---
" said Gabriel.

---
Gabriel lately, for the first time since
 his prostration by misfortune, had been independent in
--
.
---
But this incurable
 loitering beside Bathsheba Everdene stole his time
 ruinously.
---
The spring tides were going by without
 floating him off, and
---
Flossy catkins of the later kinds, fern- sprouts
 like bishops' croziers, the square- headed moschatel, the
 odd cuckoo- pint,-- like an apoplectic saint in a niche
 of malachite,-- snow- white ladies'-smocks, the toothwort,
 approximating to human flesh, the enchanter's night-
 shade, and the black- petaled doleful- bells, were among
 the quainter objects of the vegetable world in and about
 Weatherbury at this teeming time; and of the animal,
 the metamorphosed figures of Mr. Jan Coggan, the
 master- shearer; the second and third shearers, who
 travelled in the exercise of their calling, and do not re-
 quire definition by name; Henery Fray the fourth
 shearer, Susan Tall's husband the fifth, Joseph Poorgrass
 the sixth, young Cain Ball as assistant- shearer, and
 Gabriel Oak as general supervisor.
---
Here the shearers knelt,, and the polished
 shears they flourished, causing these to bristle with a
 thousand rays strong enough to blind a weak- eyed man.

---
; his old times are still
 new
---
; his present is futurity.

---
who,, made himself useful upon
 any of the bordering farmsteads.

---
Gabriel, hovered under her
 bright eyes like a moth, did not shear continuously,
 half his time being spent in attending to the others
 and selecting the sheep for them.
---
At the present
 moment he was engaged in handing round a mug of
 mild liquor,.

---
as he put down the luncheon to drag
 a frightened ewe to his shear- station,
---
He lopped off the tresses about its head, and
---
his mistress quietly looking
 on:
"
---
Poor Gabriel's soul was fed with a luxury of content
 by having her over him and
---
, her eyes critically regarding
 his skilful shears, which apparently were going,
---
Like Guildenstern, Oak was happy in.
---
that he was
 not over happy
---
He had no wish to converse with her:
 that his bright lady and himself formed one group,
 exclusively their own, and containing no others in the
 world,.

---
: that was
 Gabriel's.
---
Full of this dim and temperate bliss, he
 went on to fling the ewe over upon her other side,

---
" How long, miss?" said Gabriel,.

---
Cainy now runs forward with the tar- pot."
---
But heartless circumstance could not leave entire
 Gabriel's happiness of this morning.
---
the men were proceeding with the shear-
 lings and hogs,.

---
when Oak's belief to
 stand pleasantly by and time him through another
 performance was painfully interrupted by Farmer Bold-
 wood's appearance in the extremest corner of the barn
---
there
 he certainly was.
---
Boldwood always carried with him a
 social atmosphere of his own, which everybody felt who
 came near him; and
---
He crossed over towards Bathsheba, who turned to
 greet him with a carriage of perfect ease.
---
He spoke to
 her in low tones, and
---
her voice ultimately even
 caught the inflection of his.
---
was not audible to
 Gabriel, who was too independent to get near, though
 too concerned to disregard.
---
Gabriel theorized, not without
 truth,.

---
Gabriel sheared on,.

---
he walked up and
 down alone for nearly a quarter of an hour.
---
young
 Bob Coggan led-on-her mare,.
  
---
Boldwood fetching his
 own horse from the tree under which it had been tied
---
Oak's eyes could not forsake them; and
---
that he watched Boldwood's manner
---
, he snipped the
 sheep in the groin.
---
to Oak, who" knew Bathsheba,
---
which the abiding
 sense of his inferiority to both herself and Boldwood was

---
that he had no longer a lover's interest in her,

---
But a manly resolve to recognize
 boldly helped him.

---
he shouted, in an unmoved voice of routine.

---
Cainy Ball ran up
---
Boldwood gently tossed Bathsheba into the saddle,
 and
---
Boldwood's deep attachment was a matter of great
 interest among all around him; but,
---
after having been
 pointed out for so many years as the perfect exemplar
 of thriving bachelorship, his lapse was an anticlimax
 somewhat resembling that of St. John Long's death by
 consumption in the midst of his proofs that it was not
 a fatal disease.
"
---
said Coggan,.

---
for' tis a pity he and she
 should trouble two houses
---
what a man I be,
 and' scarn?"

---
there's gifted men willing; but the spite-- no
---
Farmer Boldwood kissed her behind the spear- bed at the
 sheep- washing t'other day--
---
" What a lie!" said Gabriel.

---
" said Oak, with
 a pharisaical sense that he was not as other shearers in
 this matter.

---
what's a old  man's standing

---
ye to be a wonderful veteran man
---
" Nobody." said Joseph Poorgrass.
---
" Ay, and as a young man,, I was likewise liked by a good- few who
 knowed me."
---
The bent and hoary' man was satisfied, and
---
who, what with her
 brown complexion, and the working wrapper of rusty
 linsey, had at present the mellow hue of an old sketch
 in oils-- notably some of Nicholas Poussin's:--
" Do anybody know of a crooked man, or a lame, or
 any second- hand fellow at all that would do for poor
 me
---
Coggan furnished a suitable reply.
---
Oak went on
 with his shearing, and.
---
He did not covet the post
 relatively to the farm:  in relation to herself,.

---
as beloved
 by him and unmarried to another, he had coveted it
---
His readings of her seemed now.
---
His lecture to her was
---
, he thought, one of
 the absurdest mistakes.
---
He was.
---
the anticipations of
 his easy- going and worse- educated comrades, that day

---
Gabriel at this time of his life had out-
 grown the instinctive dislike which every Christian
 boy has for reading the Bible, perusing it now quite
 frequently, and he inwardly said," I find more bitter
 than death the woman whose heart is snares and
 nets!"
---
He adored Bathsheba just the same.

---
"" said Cainy Ball,.
---
And there was a great black crock upon the brandish
 with his legs, but
---
" to do my duty by it all said Joseph
 Poorgrass, in a pleasant, masticating manner of anticipa-
 tion.
---
which he did
 with great readiness
---
At this moment Mr. Boldwood came in at the gate,
 and.

---
He apologized for his lateness: 
---
his arrival was evidently
 by arrangement.
" Gabriel.
---
Mr. Boldwood come there
---
Oak moved in silence back to his original seat.

---
Inwardy, too, he
 was blithe, and consequently chatty to an exceptional
 degree.
---
that he had come
---
,
 though the uninvited presence of Pennyways, the bailiff
, disturbed her equan-
 imity for a while
---
, Coggan began on his own
 private account, without reference to listeners: --

---
Now, Master Poorgrass, your song!" said Coggan.

---
"" said Joseph,.

---
--
 never!" said Coggan,."
---
said Coggan.

---
to keep my colours from rising" said Joseph, differently;
" but."

---
he replied, in a yielding tone,
".
---
Poorgrass, thus assured, trilled forth yet
 commendable piece of sentiment,
---
This was so successful
 that he rashly plunged into a second in the same
 breath, after a few false starts: --
 I sow'-ed
---
said Coggan, at the end of the
 verse.
---
Though" love" is
 a nasty high corner when a man's voice is getting
 crazed.
---
ex-
 hibited one of those anomalies:  in
 trying to check his laughter, he pushed down his throat
 as much of the tablecloth as he could get hold of, when,
 after continuing hermetically sealed for a short time
---
, his
 mirth burst out through his nose.
---
Joseph perceived it,
 and.
---
Coggan boxed Bob's ears immediately.

---
" Go on, Joseph-- go on, and never mind the young
 scamp." said Coggan.
---
Bob
 Coggan was sent home for his ill manners, and
---
tran-
 quility was restored by Jacob Smallbury, who volunteered
 a ballad as inclusive and interminable as that with which
 the worthy toper old Silenus amused on a similar occasion
 the swains Chromis and Mnasylus, and other jolly dogs
 of his day.

---
Gabriel suddenly missed Farmer Boldwood from his
 place at the bottom of the table.
---
he had

---
Oak did not know
---
he had apparently
 withdrawn into the encircling dusk.
---
Whilst he was

---
their
 lively new flames shone down the table and over the
 men, and.

---
that Boldwood had gone inside the room, and

---
Boldwood had
 drawn up on her left, within the room.
---
For his bride a soldier sought her,
 And!

---
he:
 On the banks of Allan Water
 None was gay as she
---
In addition to the dulcet piping of Gabriel's flute,
 Boldwood supplied a bass in his customary profound
 voice,, however,
---
uttering his notes so softly as to abstain
 entirely from making anything like an ordinary duet of
 the song; they rather formed a rich unexplored shadow,
 which threw her tones into relief.
---
that Gabriel could
 not avoid
---
Yet there was nothing exceptional in
 his actions beyond what appertained to his time of
 performing them.
---
that Boldwood observed her
---
; he turned aside;
---
he
 was silent
---
praised; he murmured
 his thanks.
---
the necessity of being jealous, troubled with, did not lead Oak.

---
, Boldwood thereupon closing the sash and the
 shutters, and
---
Oak wandered
 away under the quiet and scented trees.
---
to leave, Coggan turning to
 Pennyways: --
"."
---
as he pushed back the bench
---
the
 man deserves it--
---
he remarked,.

---
as if he were the masterpiece of some
 world- renowned artist
---
" so to allude" hiccupped Joseph Poorgrass,".

---
" Well, I'll say this for Pennyways."
---
whenever he do really make up his mind,
---
as I could
 see by his face he
---
that he's stole nothing at all
---
--' tis an honest deed, and said Joseph;.
  
---
he was kneeling in it--
---
His body moved restlessly, and
---
This unwonted abstraction by love of all dignity from
 a man of whom it had ever seemed the chief component,

---
But, Mr.
 Boldwood, hesitation on so high a matter is honourable
 in any woman, and
---
Boldwood withdrew with a serene smile
---
; he had
---
even until he had
---
Gabriel had
---
this tender
 devotion was to a great extent unknown to his mistress,
 and
---
" I am a man."

---
said
 the man.

---
The man was brilliant in
 brass and scarlet.
---
He was a soldier.
---
His sudden
 appearance was to darkness.
---
It was immediately apparent that the military man's
 spur had become entangled in the gimp which decorated
 the skirt of her dress.
---
He caught a view of her face.

---
he said,
 with new- born gallantry.

---
He too stooped, and
---
He looked hard into her eyes
---
that he was young
 and slim, and
---
that he wore three chevrons upon his
 sleeve
---
he unwound a cord from the little
 wheel.
---
whether by
 accident or design, he touched it.
---
His unravelling went on, but
---
" he
 said.

---
He added a
 sigh which had as much archness in it as a sigh.
---
" he said,.

---
,
 continued the young man in a murmur, and
---
so
 did he.
---
" Ah, Beauty; good- bye!" he said.

---
really it might be
 Sergeant Troy home on furlough,.
---
though I have not
 seen him
---
He was here once in that way."

---
" He had."

---
" What kind of a person is he?"

---
him to be very quick and
---
as he is
---
He's a doctor's son by name,
"

---
he's an earl's son by
 nature!
---
And, he was brought up so well, and.

---
while he was there
---
he got on so far that he could take down Chinese
 in shorthand
---
However, he wasted his gifted lot,
 and; but
---
even then he rose.
---
And is he
---
After all, how could a cheerful wearer of skirts
 be permanently offended with the man?
---
so meanly done as what I did do to sulk away like that
 from a man who was only civil and kind
---
that he had

---
Boldwood's never once told her
---
He was a man to whom memories were an in-
 cumbrance, and anticipations a superfluity.
---
what was before his
 eyes
---
Simply
 feeling, considering, and caring for, he was vulnerable only in the present.
---
His out-
 look upon time
---
was as a transient flash of the eye now
 and then:  that projection of consciousness into days
 gone by and to come, which makes the past a synonym
 for the pathetic and the future a word for circum-
 spection, was foreign to Troy.
---
With him the past
 was yesterday; the future, to- morrow; never, the day
 after.

---
he might
---
Sergeant Troy, being entirely innocent of the
 practice of expectation, was.
---
It is not a denial of anything
 to have been always without it, and what Troy had
 never enjoyed he did not miss; but,
---
that he enjoyed
---
being fully
 conscious,
 his capacity, though really less, seemed greater than
 theirs.

---
He was moderately truthful towards men, but
---
He never passed the line which divides the spruce
 vices from the ugly; and
---
though his morals had

---
This treatment
 had led to his becoming a sort of regrater of other
 men's gallantries, to his own aggrandizement as a
 Corinthian, rather than to the moral profit of his
 hearers.

---
His reason and his propensities had seldom any
 reciprocating influence,
---
while his intentions were as honourable as could be

---
his virtuous phases of cool meditation, the latter
 had a modest tendency to be oftener heard of than
 seen.

---
Troy was full of activity, but
---
his activities were less of
 a locomotive than a vegetative nature; and,
---
Hence, whilst he sometimes
 reached the brilliant in speech.
---
because that-was
 spontaneous, he fell below the commonplace in action,
 from inability to guide incipient effort
---
He had a
 quick comprehension and considerable force of char-
 acter; but,
---
He was a fairly well- educated man for one of middle
 class-- exceptionally well educated for a common soldier.

---
He spoke fluently and unceasingly.
---
He could in this
 way be one thing and
---
for instance, he
 could speak of love and;.

---
It is to the credit of
 men that few attempt to settle the question by experi-
 ment, and.
---
Sergeant Troy was one.

---
He had been known.
---
you are a lost man.
---
" Treat them fairly, and" he would
 say.

---
This philosopher's public appearance in Weatherbury
 promptly followed his arrival there.
---
the former being the
 men, the latter the women, who wore tilt bonnets
 covered with nankeen, which hung in a curtain upon
 their shoulders
---
Coggan and Mark Clark were mowing
 in a less forward meadow,
---
Clark humming a tune to
 the strokes of his scythe,
---
to which Jan made no attempt
 to keep time with his.
---
that he
 was doing the mistress of the farm real knight- service
 by this voluntary contribution of his labour at a busy
 time
---
As soon Troy saw her,
 and
---
sticking his pitchfork into the ground and picking
 up his crop or cane, he came forward.
---
ON THE VERGE OF THE HAY- MEAD


" AH, Miss Everdene!" said the sergeant, touching his
 diminutive cap.
---
To be sure--
 I am Sergeant Troy,.
---
I have assisted
 your uncle in these fields no end of times
---
" he said.
---
: that ill- luck should follow a man for honestly
 telling a woman she is beautiful!'
---
he was
---
Because a plain blunt man,, speaks out his
 mind without exactly intending it
---
, he's."

---
he said, carelessly.
---
Troy followed,.
"
---
The careless sergeant smiled
 within himself, and.
---
" Probably some one man on an average falls in"
 love, with each ordinary woman.
---
he is content, and.
---
Men are such constant
 fools!
---
But all these men will be
.
---
And not only those ninety- nine men, but
 the ninety- nine women are
.
---
The handsome sergeant's features were during this
 speech as rigid and stern as John Knox's in addressing
 his gay young queen.

---
Seeing, he said,"?"

---
father
 died
---
-- when I have an opportunity, which latterly
 has not been often( my mother was a Parisienne)-- and
 there's a proverb they have, Qui aime bien chatie bien
 --" He chastens who loves well." Do you understand
 me?
" Ah!"
---
said Troy,
 with much hearty conviction on the exterior of his face:
;".
---
when a
 dozen men arfe ready to speak tenderly to you, and
 give the admiration you deserve without adding the
 warning you need
---
not because
 the nature of his cajolery was entirely unperceived, but

---
You may think a man foolish.
---
Perhaps he is--.
---
But you have never been a man looking
 upon a woman, and that woman yourself."

---
which was not quite so high as his eyes
---
The sergeant looked at his watch and.
"
---
What, haven't you a watch, miss?" he inquired.

---
what the young-- man was

---
" It is an unusually good one for a man like me to
 possess.
---
" he quietly said.
---
as he retired
---
" I loved my father: good; but
---
which,
, he had praised in jest,

---
Her beauty, had in its animated phases moved him to earnest; and

---
though his seriousness was less than she imagined
---
, it
 was probably more than he imagined himself.

---
A factitious reply had been again upon his lips, but
 and
---
he looked at her with an
 arrested eye.
---
that her alluring
 beauty bore out so fully the epithets he had bestowed
 upon it that he was quite startled at his temerity in
 advancing them as false
---
He said mechanically," Ah,
 why?" and.

---
he broke out,
 bluntly
---
he said,.
---
he coaxed.

---
The sergeant brought his hand to the cap on the
 slope of his head,.

---
It was in the latter part of June, and the day after
 the interview with Troy in the hayfield, that Bathsheba
 was standing in her garden, watching a swarm in the
 air and guessing their probable settling place.
---
The men and women being all busily engaged in
 saving the hay--
---
Troy was just opening the garden gate.

---
By the time Troy was there also, and
---
he stooped.

---
"" said Troy.
---
Troy flung down his cane
 and.

---
that her hat should be
 taken off-- veil and all attached-- and placed upon his
 head,
---
Troy tossing his own into a gooseberry bush
---
Then the veil had round
 his collar and the gloves put on him.

---
He looked such an extraordinary object in this guise
.
---
It was the removal of yet another stake from
 the palisade of cold manners which had kept him off
 Bathsheba.
---
whilst he was
 busy sweeping and shaking the bees from the tree,
 holding up the hive with the other hand for them to
 fall into
---
whilst his attention was absorbed in the operation
---
He came down.
"
---
" said Troy, through the veil,".
---
he approached her.
---
" said Troy.

---
Men and boys peeped through chinks or over walls into the barrack-
 yard.
---
"
 Troy looked far away.
---
" he said coldly.

---
that something more than his coldness had
 made
---
"" said Troy.





---
whilst the
 bristling ball of gold in the west still swept the tips of
 the ferns with its long, luxuriant rays
---
Troy stood
 in the bottom,.

---
" he said,.

---
Now." said Troy,; four right and four left thrusts.
---
as he
 raised it into the sunlight
---
Troy's arm was still again."
---
He
 repeated them."
---
Have'em again?" he said.
---
" Troy duly
 exhibited them."
---
He gave the movements as before."
---
He pointed to about a yard in front of him.

---
He flourished the sword by way of introduction
 number two, and
---
The third item
 of consciousness was that of seeing the same sword,
 perfectly clean and free from blood held vertically in
 Troy's hand( in the position technically called" recover
 swords").
---
" said Troy, quietly.
---
had there been more dexterity shown in its
 management than by the hands of Sergeant Troy, and

---
never had he been in such splendid temper for the
 performance as now in the evening sunshine among the
 ferns with Bathsheba.
---
It may safely be asserted with
 respect to the closeness of his cuts,,
---
his eye nevertheless always keenly
 measuring her breadth and outline, and
---
his lips tightly
 closed in sustained effort
---
Next, his movements lapsed
 slower, and
---
he stopped
 entirely.
"
---
, he
 said,
---
" Bravely borne!" said Troy.
---
He touched the palm of his hand with the blade,
 and
---
And Troy returned the weapon to
 the scabbard.

---
"" said Troy, softly.
---
him stoop to the grass,,
,
---
which he had severed from her manifold tresses
---
He was altogether too
 much for her, and
---
He drew near and."

---
He drew nearer still.
---
his
 scarlet form disappear amid the ferny thicket, almost in
 a flash, like a brand
---
The circumstance had been the gentle dip of Troy's
 mouth.
---
He had kissed her.





---
And Troy's deformities lay deep down from a
 woman's vision,
---
whilst his embellishments were upon
 the very surface
---
All this infatuation Gabriel saw, and.
---
That he was not beloved
---
That is a noble though perhaps an unpromising love
 which not even the fear of breeding aversion in the
 bosom of the one beloved can deter from combating his
 or her errors.
---
Oak determined.

---
He would base his appeal on what he considered her
 unfair treatment of Farmer Boldwood, now absent from
 home.

---
when Oak,, took the same path and
---
as he thought
---
Oak
 stood aside.

---
" Oh, is it Gabriel
---
to meet you," said Oak,.

---
Now Oak, with marvellous ingenuity, had been going
.
---
" But all at, it suddenly occurring to him.
---
He tried
 another preamble.
"
---
as the man to meet
 you is away from home
---
Farmer Boldwood
 -- why, thinks.
---
" he said.

---
what you meant by saying
 that Mr. Boldwood would naturally come to meet me
---
Gabriel now put forth his unobscured opinion, for
 the moment.
---
he
 said,"."

---
if his is not a courting of you
---
I did n't definitely promise Mr. Boldwood
 anything.
---
I have never cared for him.
---
I respect him,
 and
---
he has urged me.
---
as he returns
---
that I can not think of
 marrying him
---
you were trifling with him,
 and
---
I do n't trifle with
 him; but
---
then, I have nothing to do with him."

---
Oak was unfortunately led on to speak of Boldwood's
 rival in a wrong tone to her after all.
---
that young Sergeant Troy, miss
---
" never met" he sighed.


---
He is not good enough for' ee."

---
that Sergeant Troy does not
 concern us here
---
that Sergeant Troy is an educated man, and quite worthy
 of any woman
---
He is."

---
" His being higher in learning and birth than the
 ruck o' soldiers is anything but a proof of his worth.
---
Mr. Troy's course is not by any means downward;
 and
---
his superiority IS a proof of his worth!"

---
him to have no conscience at all
---
he's such a bad man
---
he is not
---
what he is
---
as if he MIGHT be bad,
 simply for your own safety
---
Do n't trust him, mistress;
 I ask you."

---
he said,
 sturdily.
---
" His cleverness in his calling may have
 tempted him astray, and
---
When he tries
---
him coming one way
---
When
 he says anything laughable
---
who will
 report your talk as" that fantastical man
---
Why he should be mentioned quite.
---
",
 th- th- that he is a thoroughly conscientious man-- blunt
 sometimes even to rudeness-- but always speaking his
 mind about you plain to your face!"

---
" He is as good as anybody in this parish!
---
He is
 very particular, too, about going to church--!"

---
yes, he
 is
---
" I am afraid nobody saw him there.
---
that he goes
 in privately by the old tower door, just when the service
 commences, and
---
He
 told me so."

---
This supreme instance of Troy's goodness fell upon
 Gabriel ears like the thirteenth stroke of crazy clock.

---
Oak was grieved.

---
He brimmed with deep feeling.
---
as he replied in a steady
 voice
---
, the steadiness of which was spoilt by the palpable-
 ness of his great effort to keep it so: --
" You know, mistress, that I love you, and
---
to consider that, both to keep yourself, and in common generosity
 to an honourable man who loves you as well as I
---
he went on.
---
Mr. Boldwood is ten years
 older than I, and
---
consider-- to consider
-- how safe you would be in his
 hands!"

---
Oak's allusion to his own love for her lessened, to
 some extent, her anger at his interference; but
---
said Oak, calmly.
---
a man say
---
what he would n't dream of
 at other times
---
that she privately and un-
 consciously respected him a little for this grim fidelity,

---
which had been shown in his tone even more than in
 his words
---
that he might stay
---
if he wished
---
He wondered, and
---
He stood still and.

---
till he could only see her
 form upon the sky
---
A distressing explanation of this anxiety to be rid of
 him at that point now ensued.
---
The shape beyond all doubt
 was Troy's.
---
Oak would not be even a possible listener,
 and at once turned back till.

---
Gabriel went home by way of the churchyard.
---
In
 passing the tower he thought of what she had said about
 the sergeant's virtuous habit of entering the church un-
 PARTICULARS OF A TWILIGHT WALK
 perceived at the beginning of service.
---
Believing was quite disused, he
 ascended the external flight of steps at the top of which

---
It was a decisive proof that
 the door had not been opened at least since Troy came
 back to Weatherbury.





---
The farewell words of
 Troy,, still
 lingered in her ears.
---
He had bidden her adieu for two
 days, which were so he stated, to be spent at Bath in
 visiting some friends.
---
He had also kissed her a second
 time.

---
that Troy's presentation of himself so aptly at
 the roadside this evening was not by any distinctly pre-
 concerted arrangement
---
He had hinted; and
---
his still
 coming
---
he had brought before her
 and kindly given her time to decide upon
---
till Boldwood
 came home before communicating to him her conclusive
 reply
---
If he marry her
---
I had half such a husband
---
I do n't care the least for Mr. Troy--
---
how much I hate him
---
" I hate him too.
---
" You admired him from your heart only this morning
 in the very world
---
He is a wild scamp
 now, and
---
you are right to hate him."

---
" He's NOT a wild scamp!
---
I have no right to hate him, nor you, nor anybody.

---
what he is
---
I do n't care for him
---
if
 any of you say a word against him
---
you cared for him
---
Of course a lady like Miss Everdene ca n't love him
---
" O, I love him
 to very distraction and misery and agony!
---
that he's
 not a fast man
---
they say about him!"

---
he is not if-- --"
" You graceless girl

, Liddy, he CANNOT BE had,

He is not had at all....
---

 returning
---
THE next evening Bathsheba, with the idea of getting
 out of the way of Mr. Boldwood in the event of to answer her note in person, proceeded.
---
Boldwood
 was stepping on, not with that quiet tread of reserved
 strength which was his customary gait, in which he
 always seemed to be balancing two thoughts.
---
Boldwood had
---
he had

---
though her fancy might not flood him with the iridescent
 hues of uncritical love
---
He came on looking upon the ground, and.
---
He looked up at the sound of her pit- pat, and

---
his changed appearance sufficiently denoted to her the
 depth and strength of the feelings paralyzed by her
 letter.

---
Seeing, he said,"?"

---
said he.
---
Boldwood walked up to her heavily
 and dully.

---
Boldwood
 burst out.
---
" It was only whispered, for something unutter-
 ably mournful no less than distressing in this spectacle
 of a man showing himself to be so entirely the vane of a
 passion.

---
" am mad" he
 said.
---
" I am no stoic at all to he supplicating here; but

---
that furthest,
 highest compliment a man can pay a woman--?
---
he loves her
---
what is a pastime
 to all other men
---
whilst his reproaches fell,

---
Can a man fooled
---
He immediately said with more resentment:"!
---
He was coming to
 Troy.
---
He did then know!
---
And
 the name fell from his lips the next moment.

---
" Why did Troy not leave my treasure alone?"
---
he
 asked, fiercely.
---
When I had no thought of injuring
 him
---
", why did he force himself upon your notice!

---
Before he worried you
---
But he stole in in my absence
 and.
---
Why did't he win you away before,
?--.
---
When I am dead they'll say, Miserable love- sick man
 that he was.
---
His unreasonable anger terrified her, and
---
" You'll chatter with him doubtless about me.
---
" Boldwood would have died for me
---
" Yes, and
 you have given way to him,.
---
He has kissed you--.

---
-- he has kissed you
---
although Boldwood was
---
that he has kissed you
---
" Ha-- then he has!"
---
" He has," she said, slowly, and, in spite of her fear,
 defiantly.
---
" Then curse him; and curse him!" said Boldwood,
.
---
Ah, a time of his life shall come
; and then may he
 ache, and wish, and curse, and yearn-- as I do now!"

---
when he will have, and
---
he has caused another man
---
sir, for I love him true
---
Boldwood's ideas had reached that point of fusion at
.
---
He did not hear her at all now.

---
" I'll punish him-- by my soul!
---
I'll meet
 him, soldier or no, and
---
If he
 were a hundred men
---
I'd horsewhip him-- --"
---
He
 dropped his voice suddenly and unnaturally."
---
when he's the greatest sinner
---
He stole your dear
 heart away with his unfathomable lies!...
---
lt is a
 fortunate thing for him that he's gone back to his
 regiment-- that he's away up the country, and not here!

---
he may not return here just yet
---
God
 he may not come into my sight,
---
For a moment Boldwood stood so inertly after this
.
---
that his soul seemed
---
He turned his face
 away, and
---
his form was soon covered over
 by the twilight.

---
as his footsteps mixed in with the low
 hiss of the leafy trees
---
Such astounding wells of fevered
 feeling in a still man like Mr. Boldwood were incompre-
 hensible, dreadful.
---
he was--
---
Troy had not returned to his distant barracks as
 Boldwood and others, but.
 
---
; he would lose his self- mastery
---
as he had this
 evening
---
; Troy's blitheness might become aggressive
---
Boldwood's anger might
 then take the direction of revenge.
 
---
Her troubled spirit was far
 away with Troy.

Coggan called
 Gabriel, who now again lodged in his house as at first,
 and
---
Hark!" said Gabriel.

---
said Gabriel, decisively.

---
said Coggan.
---
" Then wait here." said Gabriel.

---
He ran down the hill towards Farmer Boldwood's.

---
" Farmer Boldwood is not at home.

said Coggan.

Less than five minutes brought up Oak again,.

two halters dangling from his hand

Jan.
" Maryann, you go to he
---
Gabriel shouted to her
 from the top of the hedge.

---
Springing down into Boldwood's pastures, each
 pocketed his halter.
---
he seized by the mane,
---
Oak vaulted
 astride, and
---
Coggan clambered up by aid of the hank,
.

---
" The villains!" said Gabriel.
---
Coggan
 suddenly pulled up Moll and.

---
" said Gabriel.

---
" to track'em,"
 said Jan,.
---
He struck a light,
 and.
---
" Jan exclaimed.
---
we do n't hear him
---
I'd swear to his make among ten thousand."

---
"" said Oak.
---
Coggan carried an old pinchbeck repeater which
 he had inherited from some genius in his family; and

---
He lighted another match, and
---
" he said,.

---
Coggan's watch struck one.
---
" said Gabriel.

---
" Only a trot now." said Coggan, cheerfully.
---
" We
 shall overtake him in time."

---
said Coggan.
---
Gabriel dismounted.
---
" said
 Gabriel,.
---
as he moved the match
 over the ground about the turning
---
Coggan,, again scrutinized the mystic characters.

---
He screwed up his face and!"

---
" Lame." said Oak.

---
Coggan slowly staring still at the footprints
---
said Gabriel,.

---
We shall have him now!
---
"" he exclaimed.

---
The keeper of that gate is the
 sleepiest man between here and London-- Dan Randall.

---
that's his name-- for years,.
---
when he was at
 Casterbridge gate
---
"" said Gabriel.

---
said Coggan.

---
that there had been a previous call which
 they had not noticed, for on their close approach the
 door of the turnpike- house opened, and the keeper
 came out half- dressed, with a candle in his hand
---
He has
 stolen the horse!"

---
Who?" said the turnpike- man.

---
Gabriel looked at the driver of the gig, and.

---
Coggan had, however,.

---
"" he said,
 amazed.

---
expostulated Coggan," and ladies do n't
 drive at these hours,, as a jineral rule of society."

---
said Coggan.
---
Coggan and Gabriel put about their horses, and,,.

---
said
 Coggan, curiously.

---
" Yes." said Gabriel, shortly.

---
Boldwood's indignation had cooled
---
to keep Troy away from Weather-
 bury till; the second
 to listen to Oak's entreaties, and Boldwood's denuncia-
 tions, and.

---
had Troy been Boldwood, and the path
 of love the path of duty-- inflicting upon herself gratuit-
 ous tortures by imagining him the lover of another
 woman after forgetting her
---
, hut unfortunately loved him no less in
 thinking that he might soon cease to love her-- indeed,
 considerably more
---
A letter to keep him away could
 not reach him in time,.

---
even if he should be disposed
---
that the support of a lover's arms is not of a kind best
 calculated to assist a resolve to renounce him
---
till Boldwood was secure
---
before he set out
---
all the men were a- field under a monochromatic Lammas
 sky, amid the trembling air and short shadows of noon.

---
Every drop of moisture not in the men's bottles
 and flagons in the form of cider was raining as perspira-
 tion from their foreheads and cheeks.
---
when Coggan
 saw a figure in a blue coat and brass buttons running
 to them across the field
---
"?" he said.

---
I wish."
"' Tis Cain Ball."
---
said Gabriel,.

---
Oak was not bound by his agreement to assist in the
 corn- field; but
---
, so he lent a
 hand.

---
He's."
---
" dressed up in his best clothes said Matthew
 Moon.
---
He hev been away from home for a few days,

---
since he's had that felon upon his finger
---
" said Joseph
 Poorgrass,
---
straightening his back; for he, like some of
 the others, had a way of resting a while from his labour
 on such hot days for reasons preternaturally small
---
my father put his arm out of joint
---
said Jan Coggan, in an eclipsing
 tone,.

---
By this time Cainy was nearing the group of harvesters,
 and.

---
from which he took mouthfuls

---
as he ran
---
When he came close
---
, his mouth assumed the bell shape,
 and
---
he began.
   
---
" Now, Cainy!" said Gabriel, sternly. 
---
,
 that's, Cain Ball."
 
---
" Hok- hok- hok!" replied Cain."
---
Directly Cain mentioned Bath,
---
Un-
 fortunately the erratic crumb did not improve his
 narrative powers, and
---
which dangled in front of the young man
 pendulum- wise
---
he continued,
---
his eyes follow
---
directing his thoughts to Bath
 and letting," l've seed the world at last
 -- yes-- and I've seed our mis'ess-- ahok- hok- hok!"

---
" Bother the boy!" said Gabriel.
---
Please, Mister Oak, a gnat have
 just fleed into my stomach and!"

---
"' Tis terrible bad to have,
 pore boy!" said Matthew Moon.

---
like courting complete--
 hok!-- courting complete-- --" Losing the thread of his
 narrative at this point simultaneously with his loss of
 breath, their informant looked up and down the field
 apparently for some clue to it."
---
" Damn the boy!" said Gabriel.

---
Cain Ball, looking reproachfully at Oak, with eyes
 drenched in their own dew
---
Here's some cider for him-- that'll cure his throat,"

---
said Jan Coggan,
---
lifting a flagon of cider, pulling out
 the cork, and applying the hole to Cainy's mouth;
 Joseph Poorgrass in the meantime beginning.

---
that would
 follow Cainy Ball's strangulation in his cough,
---
said Joseph, in an unboastful voice;" and
 so should you, Cain Ball.
---
Mr. Coggan poured the liquor with unstinted liber-
 ality at the suffering Cain's circular mouth
---
; half of it
 running down the side of the flagon, and half of what
 reached his mouth running down outside his throat,
 and half of what ran in going the wrong way, and being
 coughed and sneezed around the persons of the gathered
 reapers in the form of a cider fog, which for a moment
 hung in the sunny air like a small exhalation.

---
said Coggan, with-
 drawing the flagon.

---
as he could speak
---
" True, true." said Joseph Poorgrass.
---
I knowed the
 boy's grandfather-- a truly nervous and modest man,
 even to genteel refinery.'
---
" Not at all, Master Poorgrass." said Coggan."' Tis
 a very noble quality in ye."

---
murmured Poorgrass, diffidently."
---
he may have begrudged no gifts....

---
Cainy's grandfather was a very clever man.
---
which is called by his name to this day
---
in a way he had no business to by rights
---
"' a used to bide about in a public- house wi' a
 woman--' a were a clever man in the sense of the term."

---
Now then." said Gabriel, impatiently,""

---
what did you
 see, Cain?
---
that his words were very effective as regarded
 Gabriel's emotions
---
the sojer was
 Sergeant Troy
---
Gabriel's features seemed.
---
" said
 Coggan.

---
The
 boy's meaning is.'
---
as such the boy's words should be suffered
---
" And the people of Bath." continued Cain,."

---
said Cain," and.
---
And do n't victuals spring up as well as drink?"
 asked Coggan,.
"
---
" said Gabriel,.

---
when the sun shone upon the bright gown and his
 red coat
---
"
" I'm coming to that, if you'll leave me alone, Mister
 Oak!" remonstrated Cainy
---
him tell it his own way
---
" Yes- let." said Coggan.

---
Gabriel settled into a despairing attitude of patience,
 and
---
Cainy went on: --
"
---
Yes; he would kneel down and."

---
that he'd earned

---
And as good a man as ever walked
---
as they'd be to him on
 a dull afternoon
---
when he's up in the pulpit lighted by
 the wax candles
---
" Perhaps he's made of different stuff.
---
than to wear
" em" said Gabriel, grimly.
---
" A very right feeling-- very." said Joseph Poorgrass.

---
" A right and proper boy." said Joseph Poorgrass.

---
exclaimed Oak,
 with much disappointment.

---
" said Gabriel,
 indignantly.

---
" said Coggan.
---
", he's not a coarse, ignorant man,."
---
for he
 was well brought up
---
that made him a soldier, and
---
Gabriel restlessly," can you
 swear in the most awful form
---
","
 said Joseph in the sepulchral tone.
'
---
that on it will grind
 him to powder
---
" Please no, Mister Oak!" said.
---
" Cain, Cain, how" asked Joseph sternly.

---
you
 swear like wicked Shimei, the son of Gera, who cursed
 as he came
---
to squander a pore
 boy's soul, Joseph Poorgrass-- that's what' tis!"
---
Cain, beginning
---
" no getting at the rights of it said Gabriel,
.

---
Gabriel, without making any
 pretence of being lively, did nothing.
---
that he
 was particularly dull
---
However, Coggan knew, and
---
together he said--
".
---
said Gabriel.





---
Gabriel was leaning over
 Coggan's garden- gate,.

---
Oak instantly knew the
 voices to he those of Bathsheba and Liddy.

---
Oak could only luxuriate in the sense of it.
---
He lingered and
---
Gabriel might have been
 there an additional half- hour when a dark form walked
 slowly by.
---
It was Boldwood.
---
" Good- night, sir." said Gabriel.

---
Boldwood likewise vanished up the road, and
---
Oak
 shortly afterwards turned indoors to bed.

---
Farmer Boldwood went on towards Miss Everdene's
 house.
---
He reached the front, and,.
---
Her back was
 towards Boldwood.
---
He went to the door,.

---
Boldwood had not been outside his garden since
 his meeting with Bathsheba in the road to Yalbury.

---
Silent and alone, he had remained in moody medita-
 tion on woman's ways,.
---
he had ever closely beheld
---
By degrees a
 more charitable temper had pervaded him, and
---
this
 was the reason of his sally to- night.
---
He had come but
.

---
as he supposed
---
the Bath escapade
 being quite unknown to him
---
He inquired for Miss Everdene.
---
he did not notice it.
---
He
 as unforgiven-- that was the issue of it all.
---
He had

---
who was to him simultaneously a delight and
 a torture,
---
he had shared with her
 as a peculiarly privileged guest only a little earlier in
 he summer
---
Boldwood did not hurry homeward.
---
when, walking deliberately through the
 lower part of Weatherbury, he heard
---
driven by a Weatherbury man
---
said Boldwood to himself,"."

---
Troy entered the carrier's house, which had been
 the place of his lodging on his last visit to his native
 place.
---
Boldwood was moved by a sudden determina-
 tion.
---
He hastened home.
---
In ten minutes he was
 back again, and.
---
as if he were going
---
as he approached
---
He heard, and
---
the voice
 was Troy's.
---
Boldwood, however, hastened up
 to him.
---
Troy had.

---
that he had brought with him
---
as if he were going
---
Troy turned up the hill and.

---
Boldwood stepped forward.

---
" I am William Boldwood."

---
The tone was all
 that had been wanted to bring Boldwood to the
 point.

---
" to speak a word with you." he said.

---
said Boldwood, standing in front
 of him," wonder or not."

---
Troy heard the dull determination in Boldwood's
 voice.
---
he carried in his hand
---
He remembered.
---
It seemed worth while to be civil to
 Boldwood.

---
said Troy,
 placing his bag on the ground."

---
I am the only person in the village, excepting
 Gabriel Oak, who does know it
---
Troy was about to utter something hastily
---
; he then
 checked himself and."
---
His voice
 was changed.
---
Boldwood's present mood was not critical enough to
 notice tones.
---
He continued,"
---
"" said Troy.
---
The tone was all
 Troy
---
heard the dull determination in Boldwood's
 voice, looked at his stalwart frame, then at the thick
 plainly; and understand, I do n't wish
---
" engaged to be married to Miss Everdene,"
 said Boldwood," but
---
" said Troy.

---
In making this statement Boldwood's voice revealed
 only too clearly a consciousness of the weakness of his
 position, his aims, and his method.
---
His manner had
 lapsed quite from that of the firm and dignified Bold-
 wood of former times; and
---
as he had

---
he would have condemned as childishly
 imbecile only a few months ago.
---
We discern a grand
 force in the lover which he lacks whilst a free man; but

---
there is a breadth of vision in the free man which in
 the lover we vainly seek.
---
Boldwood exemplified
 this to an abnormal degree
---
: he knew nothing of Fanny
 Robin's circumstances or whereabouts
---
, he knew nothing
 of Troy's possibilities, yet
---
what he said
---
" said Troy;" and
---
" Ah!" said Boldwood, in a more elastic voice."
---
"" said Troy.
---
said Boldwood,"."
---
He handed Troy a small packet.

---
said Boldwood.

---
" Stop, listen!" said Troy in a whisper.

---
" he continued.
---
Troy whistled a
 double note in a soft, fluty tone.

---
"" said Troy.

---
Troy stepped forward.

---
O God!" said Boldwood.

---
" Yes." said Troy to her.

---
his
 wheels entering the village
---
I had almost given you up, Frank
---
" said Frank.
---
said Troy.
---
During the progress of this dialogue there was a
 nervous twitching of Boldwood's tightly closed lips, and

---
his face became.
---
He now
 started forward towards Troy.
---
Troy turned to him and
.
"
---
said Boldwood, in a hoarse whisper.

---
Now." said Troy,".
---
Perhaps
 I am a bad man-- the victim of my impulses
---
Troy felt Boldwood's grasp slowly
 tightening.
---
" he gasped.
---
" said Troy.

---
Boldwood loosened his hand,!"

---
Boldwood groaned.
---
He reluctantly released the
 soldier, and."
---
said he.

---
Troy rebounded like a ball, and; but
---
he checked himself,.
---
" Troy." said."

---
Boldwood's arm moved spasmodically towards Troy's
 person again.
---
He repressed the instinct, and
---
his form
 drooped as with pain.

---
Troy went on--

---
Troy paused in secret amazement at Boldwood's
 wild infatuation.
---
He carelessly said,"?"

---
Boldwood, more like a somnambulist than a wakeful
 man, pulled out the large canvas bag he carried by way
 of a purse, and.

---
" twenty- one pounds." he said.

---
" Nothing, nothing." said Boldwood, hastily.
---
, Troy said,".
---
Opening the door, he glided inside,.

---
Boldwood waited.
---
Boldwood then saw.
---
Troy appeared
 inside,.

---
"?" said
 Boldwood, contemptuously.

---
Troy handed a folded newspaper through the slit
 between door and doorpost, and.

---
he said,.

---
Boldwood looked and.
"
---
This may be called Feeble, hey,
 Boldwood
---
" Fort meeting?" said Troy.
---
The paper fell from Boldwood's hands.
---
Troy
 continued--
" Fifty pounds to marry Fanny, Good.
---
Now, Boldwood,
 yours is the ridiculous fate which always attends inter-
 ference between a man and his wife.
---
" said Boldwood, in a hiss.

---
"" said Troy, contemptuously.

---
He wrapped the packet of gold in the notes, and.

---
Boldwood shook his clenched fist at him.
---
Troy then closed the
 door, and.

---
Just before the clock struck five Gabriel Oak and
 Coggan
---
when Oak fancied
---
he saw the opening
 of a casement in one of the upper windows
---
The two
 men were at this moment,, and
---
A handsome man leaned idly from the lattice.
---
He
 looked east and then west, in the manner of one who
 makes a first morning survey.
---
The man was Sergeant
 Troy.
---
His red jacket was loosely thrown on, but
---
he had altogether the relaxed bearing of
 a soldier taking his ease
---
Coggan spoke first,.

---
" he said.

---
Gabriel had previously beheld the sight, and
---
he now
 stood with his back.

---
somewhere."He glanced
 round upon Gabriel.
---
"?" said Oak, with a faint smile.

---
His mind sped into the future,
 and the scenes o
 repentance that would ensue from this work of haste

---
he had instantly decided
---
The union
 was not only an unutterable grief to him
---
: it amazed
 him, notwithstanding.
---
that he had passed the preceding
 week in a suspicion that such might be the issue of
 Troy's meeting her away from home
---
" he shouted, in a cheery voice,
.

---
Coggan replied to the greeting."
---
he then said to Gabriel.
---
Gabriel soon decided too.

---
he loved
---
" he returned, in a
 ghastly voice.

---
Troy, smiling
---
"" suggested Coggan.

---
Gabriel shook his head.
---
the sun kindled his scarlet coat
 to an orange glow.

---
the oak cleared quite away, and
."

---
says he," and.
---
The military man turned and.
---
Gabriel and Coggan began.

---
" Oh, Coggan." said?"

---
Troy," do you know
---
if insanity has ever appeared in Mr.
 Boldwood's family
---
Jan reflected for a moment.

---
that an uncle of his was queer in his
 head
---
" he said.

---
said Troy, lightly.
---
I'm not a proud man
---
:  nobody
 is ever able to say that of Sergeant Troy.
---
here's half- a- crown to drink my
 health, men."

---
Troy threw the coin dexterously across the front plot
 and over the fence towards Gabriel, who shunned it in
 its fall,.
---
his face turning to an angry red
---
Coggan
 twirled his eye,.
" very well.
---
" said Gabriel with
 disdain and almost fiercely."
---
As for me, I'll do with-
 out gifts from him!"

---
said Coggan, musingly.

---
if he's married to her
---
" For, mark my words, he'll buy
 his discharge and.
---
only to be kept by smoothing him down, my
 place must be lost."

---
There's Mr. Boldwood."
---
" said Oak.
---
what
 Troy meant by his question
---
Coggan and Oak nodded respectfully to the farmer,
.

---
him pass on
---
The only signs of the terrible sorrow Boldwood had
 been combating through the night, and
---
The horse bore him away, and
---
Gabriel, for
 a minute, rose above his own grief in noticing Boldwood's.

---
He saw
---
,
 the head turned to neither side, the elbows steady by
 the hips, the brim of the hat level and undisturbed in
 its onward glide, until the keen edges of Boldwood's
 shape sank by degrees over the hill.

who knew
 the man and his story
---
THE REVEL


 ONE night, at the end of August,, a man stood
 motionless in the stockyard of Weatherbury Upper
 Farm,.

---
Oak gazed with misgiving at eight naked and un-
 protected ricks, massive and heavy with the rich
 produce of one- half the farm for that year.
---
He went
 on to the barn.

---
This was the night which had been selected by
 Sergeant Troy.
---
As Oak
 approached the building the sound of violins and a
 tambourine, and the regular jigging of many feet
---
He came close to the large doors,
---
Tufts and garlands of green foliage decorated
 the walls, beams, and extemporized chandeliers, and
 immediately opposite to Oak a rostrum had been
 erected,.
---
three
 fiddlers, and beside them stood a frantic man with his
 hair on end, perspiration streaming down his cheeks,
 and a tambourine quivering in his hand
---
Troy was lolling beside her.
"
---
Gabriel delayed his entry no longer.
---
He avoided
 Bathsheba, and.
---
where Sergeant Troy was now seated,
---
Gabriel could not easily thrust himself
 within speaking distance of the sergeant, and
---
he sent
 a message,.

---
he could not attend
---
Will you tell him, then.
---
" said Gabriel,"?"

---
" M. Troy says."
---
he can not stop."

---
In Juxtaposition with Troy, Oak had a melancholy
 tendency to look like a candle beside gas, and
---
ill at
 ease, he went out again,
---
he would go home
---
thinking;
 for, under the circumstances, he had no heart for the
 scene in the barn.
---
At the door he paused for a
 moment: .

---
Troy was speaking
---
that every man may go happy to bed,

---
A treble- strong
 goblet will he handed round to each guest."

---
he said,!
'
---
If any of the men
 show the white feather
---
Thus Troy and the men on the farm were left sole
 occupants of the place.
---
Oak, not to appear unneces-
 sarily disagreeable, stayed a little while; then he, too,
 arose and.

---
Gabriel proceeded towards his home.
---
In approach-
 ing the door, his toe kicked something which felt and
 sounded soft, leathery, and distended, like a boxing-
 glove.
---
Oak took it up,; but
---
finding
, he placed it again among the grass.
---
He
 knew.
---
When he struck a light indoors there
---
Oak's eyes followed
 the serpentine sheen to the other side, where it led up
 to a huge brown garden- slug, which had come indoors
 to- night for reasons of its own.
---
It was Nature's second
 way of hinting to him.

---
that he was
---
Oak sat down.

---
This reminded him.

---
that he
 thoroughly understood
---
He left the room,.

---
that, on the sudden appearance of Oak's
 head over the fence, they did not stir or
---
They had now a terror of something greater than their
 terror of man.
---
He knew now, and.
---
that he was right
---
that
 Troy was wrong
---
Oak returned to the
 stack- yard.
---
that of necessary food for man
 and beast:  should the risk be run of deteriorating this
 bulk of corn to less than half its value, because of the
 instability of a woman?"Never,!
---
"
 said Gabriel.

---
Such was the argument that Oak set outwardly before
 him.
---
He went back to the barn to endeavour.
---
he would have passed on in the
 belief that the party had broken up,.

---
Gabriel looked in.
---
An unusual picture met his eye.

---
Coggan was on his back, with his mouth
 open,,; the
 united breathings of the horizonal assemblage forming
 a subdued roar like London from a distance.
---
Joseph
 Poorgrass was curled round in the fashion of a hedge-
 hog, apparently in attempts to present the least possible
 portion of his surface to the air; and.
---
Gabriel glanced hopelessly at the group, which, with
 one or two exceptions, composed all the able- bodied
 men upon the farm.
---
He saw at.

---
once that to be saved that night, or even the next morning,
 he must save them with his own hands
---
It was Coggan's watch striking the hour of
 two.

---
Oak went to the recumbent form of Matthew Moon,
 who usually undertook the rough thatching of the home-
 stead, and.
---
Gabriel shouted in his ear,""

---
He then went to Susan Tall's
 husband.
"
---
Oak flung down Tall's head into the
 corner again and.

---
To be just, the men were not greatly.
---
Sergeant Troy had
---
Gabriel was greatly depressed.
---
whom the
 faithful man even now felt within him as the embodi-
 ment of all that was sweet and bright and hopeless
---
He put out the expiring lights,.
---
A hot breeze, as if breathed from the
 parted lips of some dragon about to swallow the globe,
 fanned him from the south,.
---
Going on to the village, Oak flung a small stone
 against the window of Laban Tall's bedroom,; but
---
He went round
 to the back door, which had been left unfastened for
 Laban's entry, and.
"
---
" said Oak, in a stentorian
 voice.

---
" Yes." said Gabriel.

---
--"
 Gabriel took the key, without waiting to hear the
 conclusion of the tirade.
---
Ten minutes later his lonely
 figure might have been seen
---
Oak looked under the staddles and.
---
He mounted the third pile of wealth and and,.

---
Gabriel saw a candle shining in Bath-
 sheba's bedroom, and.

---
Gabriel from
 his elevated position could see over the landscape at
 least half- a- dozen miles in front.
---
that Gabriel worked entirely by feeling with his hands
---
He had stuck his ricking- rod, or poniard,
---
a smack-- smart, clear, and short,
 Gabriel felt and
---
his position to be anything but a safe one,

---
he resolved.

---
He wiped his
 weary brow, and.
---
Was his life so valuable to
 him after all?
---
What were his prospects that he
 should be so chary of running risk, when important
 and urgent labour could not be carried on without
 such risk?
---
He resolved.
---
How-
 ever, he took a precaution.
---
This he carried up the ladder, and

---
he drove in.
---
Under the
 shadow of this extemporized lightning- conductor he
 felt himself comparatively safe.

---
Before Oak had laid his hands upon his tools again
 out leapt the fifth flash, with the spring of a serpent
 and the shout of a fiend.
---
the light revealed to him
---
as he looked over the ridge of
 the rick
---
:
 then he could see no more.

---
"" said Gabriel to the darkness.

---
said the voice of Bathsheba,
" Gabriel.
---
I can not find my husband.
---
Is he with you?"

---
He is not here."

---
where he is
---
" He promised!
---
"" said Gabriel.
---
On the slope in front of him
 appeared two human shapes, black as jet.
---
Gabriel turned his
 head.
---
It had been the sixth flash which had come from
 the east behind him, and
---
the two dark forms on the
 slope had been the shadows of himself and Bathsheba.

---
Gabriel turned, and.
---
while he was still reversed in his attitude
---
he saw,.
---
as Gabriel hastily drove them in
---
He thought.

---
" Hold on!" said Gabriel,.

---
In the meantime one of
 the grisly forms had alighted upon the point of Gabriel's
 rod,, down the chain, and into
 the earth.
---
Gabriel was almost blinded, and
---
he could
 feel-- a
 sensation novel and thrilling enough; but.

---
Bathsheba's warm arm tremble in his hand
---
Oak had hardly time to gather up these impressions
 into a thought, and to see how strangely the red feather
 of her hat shone in this light, when the tall tree on the
 hill before mentioned seemed on fire to a white heat,
 and a new one among these terrible voices mingled with
 the last crash of those preceding.
---
By the
 lustre reflected from every part of the earth and from the
 wide domical scoop above it, he saw.
---
" said Gabriel, hurriedly.

---
he could distinctly hear
 her rhythmical pants, and the recurrent rustle of the
 sheaf beside her in response to her frightened pulsations
---
, he
 followed her.
---
Oak thought only of her just then.

---
At last he said--
"."

---
" said Oak,
 in a hesitating way.

---
"" said Gabriel.
---
He crossed to the barn,.
---
He
 looked through the chinks of the door.
---
as he had left it, and
---
He felt and.

---
He endeavoured
---
Then Oak went back again,.
---
Oak looked up at her.
---
since
 he left the barn
---
" he said.

---
he answered, somewhat
 surprised at the abruptness with which this new subject
 was broached.
"
---
Gabriel ceased his rustling.

---
" I went to Bath that night in the full intention of
 breaking off my engagement to Mr. Troy.
---
that scandal
 might seize hold of me for meeting him alone in that
 way
---
when he suddenly said

---
he had
---
that his constancy could not be counted on
---
unless
 I at once became his
---
And then, between
 jealousy and distraction, I married him!
---
Gabriel made no reply.

---
He was not.
---
for it was perfectly true about
 -- about his seeing somebody else
---
Gabriel soon perceived a languor in the movements of
 his mistress up and down, and
---
he said to her, gently as
 a mother--
".
---
he
 heard the latch of the gate fall.

---
He worked in a reverie now,.

---
He was disturbed in his meditation by a grating
 noise from the coach- house.
---
A huge drop of rain smote
 his face, the wind snarled round every corner, the trees
 rocked to the bases of their trunks, and
---
Driving in spars at any point and on any
 system, inch by inch he covered more and more safely
 from ruin this distracting impersonation of seven hundred
 pounds."
---
Oak soon felt
.
---
the water to be tracking cold and clammy routes down
 his back
---
Ultimately he was reduced well- nigh to a
 homogeneous sop, and
---
the dyes of his clothes trickled
 down and.

---
The rain stretched obliquely through the dull atmo-
 sphere in liquid spines, unbroken in continuity between
 their beginnings in the clouds and their points in him.

---
Oak suddenly remembered.
---
that eight months before
 this time he had been fighting against fire in the same
 spot as desperately
---
as he was fighting against water
 now-- and for a futile love of the same woman
---
But Oak was generous and true, and
---
dis-
 missed his reflections.

---
when Gabriel came down from the last stack,
 and
---
He was

---
for he was cheered by a sense of success in
 a good cause
---
he looked
 that way.
---
, who wore a red jacket, and advanced
 with his hands in his pockets, whistling
---
Troy, their leader, entering the farmhouse
---
Not a single one of them had turned his face to the
 ricks, or.

---
Soon Oak too went homeward, by a different route
 from theirs.
---
In front of him against the wet glazed
 surface of the lane he saw.
---
a person walking yet more
 slowly than himself under an umbrella
---
The man
 turned and
---
plainly started; he was Boldwood.

---
" How?" said Oak.

---
Boldwood seemed.

---
" You look tired and ill, Oak."
---
he said then,.

---
said Boldwood,
 shortly.
---
" Boldwood added, after an interval of
 silence: "?"

---
that announcement had upon Oak at such a
 moment
---
All the night he had been feeling-- the only instance of the kind within the circuit
 of the county.
---
he was labouring
---
A few months earlier Boldwood's
 forgetting his husbandry would have been as preposter-
 ous an idea as a sailor forgetting he was in a ship.
---
Oak
 was just thinking.

---
whatever he himself might have
 suffered from Bathsheba's marriage
---
when Boldwood spoke in a
 changed voice-- that of one who yearned to make a
 confidence and relieve his heart by an outpouring
---
""
 said Gabriel,.
---
he added, with the repose of
 a man whom misfortune had inured rather than sub-
 dued.

---
said Bold-
 wood, as if the subject came irresistibly to his tongue,
 and with a miserable lightness meant to express his
 indifference.

---
Boldwood stood still now and."
---
he continued,
---
Yes,
 He prepared a gourd, and
---
like the prophet
 I thanked Him and.
---
But the next day He
 prepared a worm; and

---
Boldwood aroused himself from
 the momentary mood of confidence into which he had
."
---
he resumed, with a carelessness which
 was like the smile on the countenance of a skull:
---
Though on foot, he held the reins and
 whip, and.
---
This
 man was her husband, formerly Sergeant Troy, who,
 having bought his discharge with Bathsheba's money,
 was gradually transforming himself into a farmer of a
 spirited and very modern school.
---
People of unalter-
 able ideas still insisted upon calling him" Sergeant"
 hen.

---
they met him,
---
" he was saying.
---
" And, Frank." said?
---
Troy had

---
Troy started visibly at the sound of the voice; yet

---
he seemed.
---
He said,."

---
him speak
---
" Stay, and attend to the horse!"
 said Troy,.
---
said Troy to the woman,.

---
in a strangely
 gentle, yet hurried voice, as he lifted her up
---
he woman made no answer.

---
Troy
 then came on towards his wife,.
---
He was
 rather agitated.

---
" he said,.

---
He suddenly seemed.

---
he said.
---
" Meet him
 the day after to- morrow: God help me!
---
He was huge, heavy, and.
---
He seemed.
---
Being thus assignable to no
 breed, he was the ideal embodiment of canine greatness
 -- a generalization from what was common to all.
---
Perhaps
 I can make use of him--!"

---
he trotted on
---
Then,
 finding, he came back and.

---
The dog, was frantic in his distress on these occasions
---
; he would
 tug at her dress and.
---
that he would give up a
 year's rental to have at his own door
---
the view-- and very probably the
 inmates would have given up the view for his year's
 rental
---
a man appeared inside.

---
He discerned the panting heap of clothes,.
---
He entered a second
 time, and.

---
The man then closed the door.

---
" Where is he gone?
---
He helped me."

---
I stoned him away."
---
said the man.

---
the man
 in front bearing the light, the two bony women next,
 supporting between them the small and supple one.

---
he was not
 disposed to say much to her
---
He exhibited the un-
 pleasant combination of a restless condition with a
 silent tongue.
---
In the
 evening Troy said,?"

---
The anxiety upon
 Troy's face was unusual and very marked.
---
lt was a
 culmination of the mood he had been in all the day.

---
Troy for the moment made no reply.
---
Her mistake
 had its advantages to a man who shrank from having
 his mind inspected as he did now.
---
" he said, at last.

---
Few men could have

---
, Troy would have succumbed instantly
---
;, he thought.

---
he would not deceive her longer
---
","
 he said.

---
Troy hesitated.
---
He did not now love her enough
 to allow himself to be carried too far by her ways.
---
", he said.
---
as he
 spoke
---
Troy had instantly closed his watch.
---
He carelessly
 replied, as one who cloaked some feelings that the sight
 had stirred."
---
he said, loudly.

---
" he inquired, quickly.
"
---
" said Troy,.
---
Troy had by this time
---
said Troy;" upon
 my heart,!"

---
Frank went on.
---
as if he had not heard her
---
, so do I."
 Trembling now, she put her hand upon his arm,
!
---
I do n't otherwise, Frank.
---
I could be content
 with nothing less than the highest homage from the
 husband I should choose
---
as he did so,
---
Directly he had gone
---
touched by no man's on earth
---
that her husband had risen,,
 and
---
self preceded in forethought by Gabriel Oak,
---
her musings under this head
 were short and entirely confined to the times when
 Troy's neglect was more than ordinarily evident.

---
It was Mr. Boldwood.
---
The two men then
 approached each other and.

---
Boldwood and
 Gabriel called to him,
---
when Boldwood turned
 back again
---
He set down his barrow, and,.

---
Mr. Boldwood is going."

---
Mr. Boldwood do any such
 thing
---
that Mrs. Troy will take upon herself the duty
 of fetching an old servant of the family
---
that the
 Union, in the form of four labouring men, will meet me
, and
---
that he might no
 longer notice the mood which had set its sign so visibly
 upon her,
---
What Oak and Mr. Boldwood told me
---
Gabriel said,.

---
,' he said,
---
Mr. Boldwood turned round to me then, and
.
---
He
 told me about her having lived by seampstering in
 Melchester, as I mentioned to you, and.
---
Not a word, mistress" he said.

---
why Gabriel did n't bring the message to
 me himself
---
He mostly makes a point of seeing me
 upon the most trifling errand."
---
" Perhaps he was busy, ma'am."
---
Joseph suggested.

---
And sometimes he seems.'
---
when he was better
 off than
---
" Did anything seem upon his mind?"

---
whilst he was

---
He was
 terrible down, and"

---
so was Farmer Boldwood.
---
" Her young man was a soldier,
---
was he not?"

---
He says

---
he knew him very well."What
---
, Mr. Troy says so?
---
he to say
 that
---
" One day I just named it to him, and.
---
if
 he knew Fanny's young man
---
He said,."

---
" O yes, he
 knew the young man
---
as he knew himself, and

---
as well that there was n't a man in the regiment
---
he liked
 better
---
that, did he?
---
" Yes; and he said,!"

CHAPTER XLII



 JOSEPH AND HIS BURDEN


 A WALL bounded the site of Casterbridge Union-
 house, except along a portion of the end.
---
Joseph Poorgrass rang
 the bell, and.
---
laid by two men in fustian along the middle of the
 vehicle
---
One of the men then stepped up beside it,.
---
He covered the
 whole with a black cloth, threadbare, but
---
one
 of the men handed a certificate of registry to Poorgrass,
 and
---
Joseph then placed the flowers, and
---
as enjoined to
 divine; he smacked his
 whip, and
---
as he walked beside the horse
---
Joseph Poorgrass looked round upon his sad burden
 then at the unfathomable gloom amid the high trees on
 each hand, indistinct, shadowless, and spectrelike in
 their monochrome of grey.
---
He felt anything but cheer-
 ful, and.
---
he had the company even of a child or
 dog
---
Stopping the home, he listened.
---
The nearer boughs were beaded
 with the mist to the greyness of aged men, and
---
into which Gabriel Oak
 crept on his first journey to Weatherbury; but,
---
It was a relief to Joseph's heart when the friendly
 signboard came in view, and,.
---
, he proceeded
---
His spirits were

---
He turned the horse's head
 to the green bank, and.

---
, what should
 Joseph see, in the form of the countenances of Mr. Jan
 Coggan and Mr. Mark Clark
---
" said Joseph,."
---
" Then drink, Joseph, and do n't restrain yourself!"
 said Coggan,.

---
Joseph drank for a moderately long time, then for
 a longer time,."

---
as he lowered the jug
---
said Jan,.

---
who repeated a truism so familiar to his brain,

---
that he
 hardly noticed its passage over his tongue; and
---
as one
 lifting the cup, Coggan tilted his head gradually
 backwards, with closed eyes,
---
that his expectant soul
 might not be diverted for one instant from its bliss
 by irrelevant surroundings
---
"" said Poorgrass.
---
leads us to
 that horned man in the smoky house highly favoured with a power that way" said Mark Clark.
---
"" said
 Joseph.

---
said Joseph,.

---
" said Coggan,"."

---
,"
 Coggan continued, with that tendency to talk on
 principles which is characteristic of the barley- corn.

---
, a man can
 belong to the Church and.
---
" said Joseph, thoughtfully.

---
" Yes." said Coggan.
---
But I hate a feller who'll
 change his old ancient doctrines for the sake of getting
 to heaven.
---
Why, neighbours,, our Parson Thirdly
 were the man who gave me a sack for seed, though
 he hardly had one for his own use, and no money to
 buy'em.
---
If it had n't been for him
---
" observed Joseph.
---
He's a generous man
---
; he's found
 me in tracts for years, and; but
---
he's never
 been the man to cry out at the expense.
---
The longer Joseph Poorgrass remained
---
, the less his
 spirit was troubled by the duties which devolved upon
 him this afternoon.
---
Coggan's repeater struck
 six from his pocket in the usual still small tones.

---
He
 stared sternly at the one lengthy and two round faces
 of the sitters, which confronted him with the expressions
 of a fiddle and a couple of warming- pans.
---
";' tis disgraceful,
 Joseph, disgraceful!" said Gabriel, indignantly."
---
Coggan,
 you call yourself a man, and."

---
Coggan looked up indefinitely at Oak, one or.

---
other
 of his eyes occasionally opening and closing of its own
 accord,, but a dozy individual
 with a distinct personality
---
" Do n't take on so, shepherd!" said Mark Clark,
 looking reproachfully at the candle, which appeared
 to possess special features of interest for his eyes.

---
" said
 Coggan, with the precision of a machine.
---
why should a man put himself in a tearing hurry for
 lifeless clay
---
To- mor-- row', to- mor--
" Do hold thy horning, Jan!" said Oak; and turning
 upon Poorgrass," as for you, Joseph, who do your wicked
 deeds in such confoundedly holy ways, you are as drunk
 as you can stand."

---
" said Joseph Poorgrass, meekly.

---
" Yes; I see two of every sort, as if I were some holy
 man living in the times of King Noah and entering
 into the ark.... Y- y- y- yes."
---
he added,;"!"

---
much
 affected by the picture of himself as a person thrown
 away, and
---
" I wish!"
" Show myself a man of spirit?...
---
you'd show yourself a man of spirit, and
---
that you have, Hero Poorgrass,
---
that I be not a man of spirit
---
Gabriel, seeing to Cake charge of the waggon for the remainder of
 the journey, made no reply, but,
---
He pulled the horse's head from the large patch
 of turf it had eaten bare,.

---
But, thanks to Boldwood's
 reticence and Oak's generosity, the lover had never been individualized as Troy.
---
Gabriel hoped

---
that Gabriel reached the old manor-
 house, her residence, which lay in his way to the church
---
A man came from the gate and
---
Is that Poorgrass with the corpse?"

---
Gabriel recognized the voice as that of the parson.

---
"" said Gabriel.

---
" No." said Gabriel.
---
Poorgrass has that
---
he's at the Buck's Head.
---
Gabriel had his reasons for thinking the latter a
 most objectionable plan, notwithstanding.
---
But his will was not law, and.
---
he
 went indoors
---
He found her in an unusual
 mood: .
---
Troy
 had not yet returned.
---
Oak argued upon the convenience of leaving
 her in the waggon, but."
---
Perhaps Mrs. Troy is right in feeling that we
 can not treat a dead fellow- creature too thoughtfully
."

---
Gabriel lighted a lantern.

---
Fetching three other men to assist him, they bore the
 unconscious truant indoors,.

---
Every one except Gabriel Oak then left the room.

---
He still indecisively lingered beside the body.
---
He was
.
---
that
 circumstances were putting on with regard to Troy's
 wife, and at his own powerlessness
---
( n spite of his careful manoeuvring all this day, the very
 worst event had happened now
---
Oak
 imagined a terrible discovery resulting from this after-
 noon's work that might cast over Bathsheba's life a shade
 which the interposition of many lapsing years might but
 indifferently lighten, and which nothing at all might
 altogether remove.

---
Suddenly, as in a last attempt to save Bathsheba
 from, at any rate, immediate anguish, he looked again,
.
---
as he had looked before, at the chalk writing upon the
 coffinlid
---
Gabriel took his handkerchief and
.
---
He then left the
 room, and.





---
I'll sit up for him
 myself till twelve o'clock, and
---
if he has not arrived by
 that time
---
, I shall give him up and too."

---
And within the last day or two had come these
 disquieting thoughts about her husband's past.
---
Oak
 may have had the best of intentions in withholding for
 as many days as possible the details of what had
 happened to Fanny; but
---
had he known
---
,
 he would have done nothing.

---
Oak had
---
who seemed so much deeper and
 higher and stronger in feeling than Gabriel
---
Boldwood,, had not
 yet learnt, any more than she herself, the simple
 lesson which Oak showed a mastery of by every turn
 and look he gave-- that among the multitude of interests
 by which he was surrounded, those which affected his
 personal wellbeing were not the most absorbing and
 important in his eyes.
---
Oak meditatively looked upon
 the horizon of circumstances without any special regard
 to his own standpoint in the midst.
---
But then Oak was not racked
 by incertitude upon the inmost matter of his bosom,.
---
Oak knew all about.

---
Fanny
 that he wished
---
to go to him now at once and say"
 he would feel.
---
He knew her so well.

---
that no
 eccentricity of behaviour in her would alarm him
---
Yes,
 it was Gabriel himself who was sitting up: .
---
he was reading,
 From her standing- place in the road
---
his light curly head upon his
 hand, and only occasionally looking up
---
which stood beside him
---
At length he looked
 at the clock,.
---
He was going to bed
---
Gabriel appeared in
 an upper room,.
---
which Oak's example had raised in her
---
there was no longer much room for doubt as
 to the origin of the curl owned by Troy.
---
Oak kneeling
 down that night
---
Gabriel had
 prayed;
---
her husband appeared
 at the entrance to the room,.

---
He beheld it all by degrees,.
---
as if he thought it an illusion raised by some
 fiendish
 incantation
---
as he stood with the
 door in his hand
---
that at this moment,, Troy never once thought of Fanny in
 connection with what he saw
---
His first confused idea
 was.
"
---
Well-- what?" said Troy, blankly.

---
said Troy.

---
He seized her hand, and

---
He, still holding her thus, hand in hand
---
, came up the
 room, and, Troy and Bathsheba
 approached the coffin's side.

---
Troy looked
 in,
---
he stood still.

---
So still he remained.
---
that he could be imagined to

" said Troy.

---
He had originally stood.
---
He was gradually sinking forwards.
---
What Troy did
---
that was forgotten in the simple and still strong
 attachment of wife to husband
---
that
 Troy, loosening her tightly clasped arms from his neck
---
It was such and unex-
 pected revelation of all women being alike at heart, even
 those so different in their accessories as Fanny and this
 one beside him, that Troy could hardly seem to believe
 her to be his proud wife Bathsheba.
---
he said.

---
that I have been a bad, black- hearted
 man
---
" to say" he answered.

---
He turned to Fanny then
---
It was the product*
 of her union with Troy.

---
said Troy,
 heartlessly.
---
A vehement impulse to flee from him, to run from
 this place, hide, and escape his words at any price, not
 stopping short of death itself, mastered Bathsheba now.

over-
 hung by some large oak and beech trees

Presently he came opposite,
 and

that he was one of
 the boys on her own farm
---
He was followed by a
 shambling tramp of heavy feet, and
---
He was a schoolboy, with a
 bag slung over his shoulder containing his dinner,
 and a hook in his hand.
---
He paused by the gate,
 and, without looking up,.

---
The boy was of the
 dunce class apparently
---
this was his way of learning the collect.

I heard his voice late last night; and

Is he at home?

No; he left."

CHAPTER XLV



 TROY'S ROMANTICISM


 WHEN Troy's wife had left the house at the previous
 midnight
---
his first act was.

---
he ascended the stairs, and
---
as he was
---
dressed, he waited miser-
 ably for the morning.

---
Fate had dealt grimly with him through the last four-
 and- twenty hours.
---
His day had been spent in a way
 which varied very materially from his intentions regard-
 ing it.
---
,
 he had managed.
---
he
 could muster on his own account, which had been seven
 pounds ten
---
With this money, twenty- seven pounds ten
 in all, he had hastily driven from the gate that morning
.

---
On reaching Casterbridge he left the horse and trap
 at an inn, and.
---
A rush of recollection
 came upon Troy
---
as he waited
---
: this was the second
 time she had broken a serious engagement with him
 In anger he vowed it should be the last, and at eleven
 o'clock, when he had lingered and watched the stone
 of the bridge till he knew every lichen upon their face
 and heard the chink of the ripples underneath till they
 oppressed him.

---
, he jumped from his seat, and
---
He reached the race- course at two o'clock, and
---
as it had appeared to him in the sombre
 shadows of that Saturday evening,
---
Fanny's image, returned to his mind,
.
---
He vowed, and
---
he
 would not bet
---
he kept his vow, for on leaving the
 town at nine o'clock in the evening.

---
he had diminish
 his cash only to the extent of a few shillings
---
He trotted slowly homeward, and
---
He regretted.
---
that he had not remained in Casterbridge
 and
---
Reaching home he quietly un-
 harnessed the horse and.

---
that awaited him
---
As soon,
 Troy arose from the coverlet of the bed, and in a mood
 of absolute indifference to Bathsheba's whereabouts, a
 almost oblivious of her existence
---
, he stalked downstairs
 and.
---
His walk was
 towards the churchyard,.
---
which he searched
 around
---
till he found a newly dug unoccupied grave--

---
, he hastened on to Caster-
 bridge,.

---
he had last seen Fanny alive
---
Reaching the town, Troy descended into a side
 street and."

---
Troy was so unlike himself now in look, word, and
 deed, that the want of likeness was perceptible even to
 his own consciousness.
---
His method of engaging himself
 in this business of purchasing a tomb was that of an
 absolutely unpractised man.
---
He could not bring him-
 self to consider, calculate, or economize.
---
He waywardly
 wished for something, and.'
---
he set about in a nursery
---
he said to
 the man who stood in a little office within the yard.

---
It was all the money he possessed.

---
." said Troy, impatiently. 
---
Troy then
 settled the account and.
---
He waited in the yard till
---
He carried rather a heavy basket upon his
 occasionally at bridges and gates,
---
whereon he deposited

---
, the men and the waggon
 the work was done, and,.
---
on being assured,
 Troy entered Weatherbury churchyard
---
as the men had stated
---
Troy deposited his basket beside the tomb, and
.
---
When he returned
---
he
 carried a spade and a lantern, the light of which he
 directed for a few moments upon the marble, whilst he
 read the inscription.
---
He hung his lantern on the lowest
 bough of the yew- tree, and.
---
Troy laid these out upon the grass, and with an im-
 passive face set to work to plant them.
---
Troy, in his prostration at this time, had no percep-
 tion that in the futility of these romantic doings, dictated
 by a remorseful reaction from previous indifference
---
Deriving his idiosyn-
 crasies from both sides of the Channel, he showed at
 such junctures as the present the inelasticity of the
 Englishman, together with that blindness to the line
 where sentiment verges on mawkishness, characteristic
 of the French.

---
the rays from Troy's lantern spread into the two old
 yews with a strange illuminating power, flickering,.
---
He
 felt a large drop of rain upon the back of his hand, and

---
out-
 Troy was weary and and
---
, he resolved.
---
He groped along the wall and over the graves
 in the dark.

---
till he found himself round at the north side
---
Here he entered the porch, and,
---
that nothing on earth could be more hideous
 than those he saw on the north side until he went
 round to the south
---
It
 was too human to be called like a dragon, too impish
 to be like a man, too animal to be like a fiend, and not
 enough like a bird to be called a griffin.
---
Troy slept on in the porch, and
---
his shoulders felt stiff his feet tender, and his head
 heavy
---
He remembered his position,.

---
He entered the gravel path which would take him
 behind the tower.
---
At one place in the path he saw
 a tuft of stringy roots.
---
He picked it up
---
-- surely it could
 not be one of the primroses he had planted?
---
He saw
 a bulb, another, and another as he advanced.
---
With a face of perplexed
 dismay Troy turned the corner and.

---
The disturbed
 earth was washed over the grass and pathway in the
 guise of the brown mud he had already seen, and
---
Troy's brow became.
---
He set his
 teeth closely, and
---
his compressed lips moved as those of
 one in great pain.
---
This singular accident, by a strange
 confluence of emotions in him, was felt as the sharpest
 sting of all.
---
Troy's face was very expressive, and.
---
who had seen him now
---
him to be a man who had laughed,
---
To curse
 his miserable lot was at first his impulse, but
---
whose
 absence was necessarily antecedent to the existence of the
 morbid misery which wrung him.
---
it was more than he could endure.

---
Sanguine by nature, Troy had a power of eluding
 grief by simply adjourning it.
---
He could put off the
 consideration of any particular spectre till the matter
.
---
as if his intention had been known and
---
as he stood
 by this dismantled grave
---
that the fact of his life being his own is the one
 qualification which singles it out as a more hopeful life
 than that of others who may actually resemble him in
 every particular
---
Troy had felt, in his transient way,
.
---
that he could not envy other people
 their condition,
---
when he
 desired no other than his own
---
that related to him
---
, the vicissitudes of his life,
 the meteorlike uncertainty of all,
 because these appertained to the hero of his story,
 without whom there would have been no story at all for
 him; and
---
, all of a
 sudden, Troy hated himself.
---
He stood and.
---
Whither
 should he go?"
---
He accursed, let."
---
him be accursed
 still
---
who has
 spent his primal strength in journeying in one direction

---
A man has not much spirit left for reversing his course.
---
Troy
 had, since yesterday,; but
---
the merest
 opposition had disheartened him.
---
that Providence, far from
 helping him into a new course, or showing any wish
 that he might adopt one,
---
He slowly withdrew from the grave.
---
He simply threw up his cards and
.
---
-- he passed down some fields
 at the back, and.
---
Shortly afterwards he had gone from the village.

---
The light
 of Troy's lantern in the churchyard was noticed about
 ten o'clock by the maid- servant, who casually glanced
 from the window in that direction whilst taking her
 supper, and
---
He's now gone on."

---
Gabriel has been here this morning!"

---
he had left off lately
---
Has Mr. Troy been in to- night?
---
he's gone to Budmouth
---
The sound of the word carried with
 it a much diminished perspective of him and his deeds;
 there were thirteen miles interval.

---
he has gone there
---
" Laban Tall saw him on the Budmouth road this
 morning before breakfast."

---
the men having returned
---
just as Troy had seen it
---
On the other side of the scene stood Gabriel.

---
His eyes, too, were fixed on the tomb, and her arrival
 having been noiseless
---
Then
 her eye followed Oak's, and
---
Oak saw her, and
---
his first act was.
---
Whilst
 Oak was doing
---
TROY wandered along towards the south.
---
The sad accessories
 of Fanny's end confronted him as vivid pictures which
 threatened to be indelible, and.
---
At three in the afternoon he found
 himself at the foot of a slope more than a mile in length,
.
---
Troy toiled up the road with a languor and depression
 greater than any he had experienced for many a day
 and year before.
---
as he approached
---
At last he reached the summit, and
---
a wide and
 novel prospect burst upon him with an effect almost like
 that of the Pacific upon Balboa's gaze.
---
The broad
 steely sea stretched the
 whole width of his front and round to the right, where,
 near the town and port of Budmouth
---
He descended and.
---
Troy's nature freshened within
 him
---
; he thought.
---
he would rest and before
 going farther
---
He undressed and.
---
being smooth as a pond, to get a little of the ocean
 swell, Troy presently swam between the two projecting
 spurs of rock which formed the pillars of Hercules to
 this miniature Mediterranean.
---
Unfortunately for Troy
 a current unknown to him existed outside,.
---
Troy
 found.

---
himself carried to the left and
---
He now recollected the place and its sinister
 character.
---
Troy began.
---
that he might be added to their number
---
After wellnigh exhausting himself in attempts
 to get back to the mouth of the cove, in his weakness
 swimming several inches deeper than was his wo nt,
 keeping up his breathing entirely by his nostrils,
---
, Troy resolved as a last resource to tread
 water at a slight incline, and.
---
This, necessarily a slow process, he
 found.
---
though there
 was no choice of a landing- place-- the objects on shore
 passing by him in a sad and slow procession
---
-- he per-

---
as his only means of salvation on
 this side of the Unknown, a moving object broke the
 outline of the extremity, and
---
Troy's vigour spasmodically revived.
---
Swimming with his
 right arm, he held up his left.
---
From
 the position of the setting sun his white form was
 distinctly visible upon the now deep- hued bosom of the
 sea to the east of the boat, and
---
the men saw him at
 once.
---
Backing their oars and putting the boat about,
 they pulled towards him with a will, and
---
in five or six
 minutes from the time of his first halloo, two of the
 sailors hauled him in over the stern.

---
Lending him late they made again towards the roadstead where their
 And now night drooped slowly upon the wide watery
 levels in front; and
---
There had origin-
 but the peculiar nature of her uncle's will, his own
 frequent testimony before his death to her cleverness
 in such a pursuit, and her vigorous marshalling of the
 numerous flocks and herds which came suddenly into
 her hands before negotiations were concluded
---
that
 in the event of her own or her husband's inability to
 meet the agent at the forthcoming January rent- day,
 very little consideration would be shown, and
---
I am looking for Mrs. Troy
---
Her
 husband is drowned."

---
A gloomy man,, stepped quickly to her side at the moment of
 her exclamation, and.

---
Boldwood, looking up at the
 bringer of the big news, as he supported her
---
" Her husband was drowned this week.
---
A coastguardsman found his clothes,
 and."

---
Thereupon a strange fire lighted up Boldwood's eye,
 and.
---
his face flushed with the suppressed excitement of
 an unutterable thought
---
He
 lifted her bodily off the ground, and.

---
Here he passed with her under the archway into a
 private room; and by the time he had deposited-- so
 lothly-- the precious burden upon a sofa
---
Boldwood left the room.
---
He stood for a moment in
 the passage.
---
The experience had
 been too much for his consciousness
---
that he had grasped it
---
; he had been close to hers.

---
He started onward again, and.

---
what he had already
 heard
---
He then ordered, and.

---
He found.

---
The first shades of evening were showing them-
 selves when Bathsheba reached home, where, silently
 alighting and leaving the horse in the hands of the boy
---
Because he's still alive."

---
I am
 perfectly convinced that he is still alive!"

---
which,
 beyond making by a methodizing pen formidable pre-
 sumptive evidence of Troy's death by drowning, con-
 tained the important testimony of a young Mr. Barker,
 M.D., of Budmouth, who spoke to being an eyewitness
 of the accident, in a letter to the editor
---
In this he
 stated.
---
that he was passing over the cliff on the remoter
 side of the cove
---
At that
 time he saw a bather carried along in the current outside
 the mouth of the cove, and.
---
unless he should
 be possessed of unusual muscular powers
---
He drifted
 behind a projection of the coast, and
---
But by the time
 that he could reach an elevation
---
The other circumstance was the arrival of his clothes,
.
---
though this had virtually been done long before
 by those who inspected the letters in his pockets
---
that anything
 but death could have prevented him
---
that Troy had followed Fanny
 into another world
---
Had he done this intentionally, yet
?

---
he had shown that night
 
---
which had been restored to her with the rest
 of the articles belonging to him
---
as he had opened it before her a week ago
---
He was hers and
---
that he was not hers
 still
---
However, one excellent result of her general apathy
 was the long- delayed installation of Oak as bailiff; but

---
he having virtually exercised that function for a long
 time already
---
Boldwood lived secluded and inactive.
---
Much of
 his wheat and all his barley of that season had been
 spoilt by the rain.
---
it was elicited from one of
 Boldwood's men.
---
for he had been reminded of the danger to
 his corn as many times and as persistently as inferiors
 dared to do
---
he one evening sent for Oak.
---
that Gabriel
 should undertake the superintendence of the Lower
 Farm as well as of Bathsheba's, because of the necessity

---
Boldwood felt for such aid, and the impossibility of
 discovering a more trustworthy man
---
Gabriel's malig-
 nant star was assuredly setting fast.

---
that the two farms together
 were too extensive for the observation of one man
---
Boldwood,, suggested.
---
that Oak
 should be furnished with a horse for his sole use,

---
Boldwood did not directly
 communicate with her during these negotiations,.

---
Oak mounted on a strong cob, and
---
as if the crops
 belonged to him
---
that Gabriel Oak was feathering his
 nest fast
---
" Gable Oak
 is coming it quite the dand
---
He now wears shining
 boots with hardly a hob in'em, two or three times
 a- week, and a tall hat a- Sundays, and' a hardly knows
 the name of smockfrock.
---
to he cut up into bantam cocks
---
that Gabriel, though paid
 a fixed wage by Bathsheba independent of the fluctua-
 tions of agricultural profits,
---
by which Oak was, yet.

---
,
 for though his condition had thus far improved, he
 lived in no better style than before,,,, and
---
as Oak was not only provokingly
 indifferent to public opinion, but
---
But a man,, there was room for doubt as to his
 motives.

---
A great hope had latterly germinated in Boldwood
---
This fevered hope had grown up
 again like a grain of mustard- seed during the quiet
 which followed the hasty conjecture that Troy was
 drowned.
---
He nourished it fearfully, and.
---
How long he might have.
---
he had

---
what he would try
---
he trusted.
---
that
 man would be himself
---
There was a substratum of
 good feeling in her: her self- reproach for the injury
 she had thoughtlessly done him.
---
Such was Boldwood's hope.

---
endeavouring to get a notion of her
 middle of the haymaking, and Boldwood contrived to
" I am glad to see you out of doors, Lydia."
---
he said
.

---
why he
" I hope
---
Mrs. Troy is quite well after
---
" Mrs Troy puts much confidence in you, Lydia,
 and very wisely, perhaps."

---
Mr. Troy's
 going and all
---
that his darling had thought of re- marriage
---
how very stupid Mr. Boldwood was getting
---
" he returned hastily,.
---
his hope falling
 again
---
Boldwood, growing red
---
so Mr,
 Oak says.
---
He went away vexed with himself, and.
---
ashamed of
 having for this one time in his life done anything which
 could be called underhand
---
Poor Boldwood had no
 more skill in finesse than a battering- ram, and
---
he was
 uneasy with a sense of having made himself to appear
 stupid and
---
But he had,.
---
This pleasant notion was now continually in his mind.

---
he had for
---
Jacob had served twice seven years for
 Rachel
---
He
 tried.
---
Boldwood felt his love
.
---
He would annihilate
 the six years of his life as if they were minutes--.
---
so little
 did he value his time on earth beside her love
---
He
 would let, all those six years of intangible ether-
 eal courtship, how little care he had for anything but as
 it bore upon the consummation.

---
-- TROY TOUCHES HIS WIFE'S HAND



---
The shepherd of each flock marched behind,
 a bundle containing his kit for the week strapped upon
 his shoulders, and
---
in his hand his crook, which he used
 as the staff of his pilgrimage.
---
Men were shouting,

---
" The Royal Hippodrome Performance of Turpin's
 Ride to York and the Death of Black Bess." replied the
 man promptly, without turning his eyes or leaving off
 trying.

---
These were so convinced by such genuine appeals to
 heart and understanding both that they soon began to
 crowd in abundantly, among the foremost being visible
 Jan Coggan and Joseph Poorgrass, who were holiday
 keeping here to- day,
"' That's the great ruffen pushing me!" screamed a
 woman in front of Jan over her shoulder at him when
 the rush was at its fiercest.

---
" pushing ye?" said Coggan, in a deprecating tone,.

---
in which Coggan
 and Poorgrass were again thrust by those behind upon
 the women in front
---
Now." said Coggan, appealing in an earnest voice
 to the public at large.
---
" They might get their men by the shine of their eyes."

---
Jan held his tongue,, and
---
as if he had no objection to be
 pacified to please a friend
---
, Poorgrass being flattened like a
 jumping- jack, and.
---
which he
 had got ready half- an- hour earlier
---
who
 took the money of him
---
whom we
 instantly recognise as Sergeant Troy
---
Troy's appearance in this position may be briefly
.
---
aboard which he was taken in
 Budmouth Roads
---
Troy read the articles and
, but
---
as he had
---
his clothes were
---
He ultimately worked his passage
 to the United States, where he made a precarious living
 in various towns as Professor of Gymnastics, Sword
 Exercise, Fencing, and Pugilism.
---
There was a certain animal form of refinement in his
 nature; and
---
There
 was ever present, too, the idea that he could claim a
 home and its comforts did he but chose to return to
 England and Weatherbury Farm.
---
To England he did return at last; but the

---
his intention to enter his old groove at
 the place became.
---
he con-

---
if he were
---
that to go home
 his reception would be of a kind very unpleasant to con-
 template
---
what Troy had in the way of emotion
---
how
 could he endure existence with a spirited wife to whom
 at first entering?
---
he would be beholden for food and
 lodging
---
Moreover, it was not at all unlikely that his
 wife would fail at her farming; and
---
he would then become liable for her
 maintenance:  and!
---
, he put off his return from day
 to day, and.

---
if he could have found anywhere else the ready- made
 establishment which existed for him there
---
-- he fell in with a
 travelling circus which was performing in the outskirts of
 a northern town.
---
Troy introduced himself to the
 manager by taming a restive horse of the troupe, hitting
 a suspended apple with pistol-- bullet.
---
For
 his merits in these-- all more or less based upon his ex-
 periences as a dragoon- guardsman-- Troy was taken into
 the company, and
---
the play of Turpin was prepared with
 a view to his personation of the chief character.
---
Troy
 was not greatly elated by the appreciative spirit in which
 he was undoubtedly treated, but
---
he thought.

---
without having formed any
 definite plan for the future, that Troy found himself
 at Greenhill Fair with the rest of the company on this
 day.

---
who was driven to the fair that day
 by her odd man Poorgrass
---
Boldwood, her comparatively isolated, came up to her side.

---
the sheep have done well to- day, Mrs. Troy? nervously
---
"
 he said,
---
He was looking at this large tent and the announcement.

---
Turpin was a real man
---
", was he not?"

---
Jan Coggan say that a relation of his knew
 Tom King, Turpin's friend, quite well.
---
Coggan is
---
" Yes, yes; we know Coggan.
---
you would like,
 Mrs. Troy?
---
Perceiving, he added,"."

---
that Oak
 might appear
---
Oak was nowhere
 to be seen; and
---
Troy, on peeping from his dressing- tent through a
 slit for a reconnoitre before entering, saw his unconscious
 wife on high before him as described,.
---
He started back in utter confusion,
 for
---
although his disguise effectually concealed his person-
 ality
---
, he instantly felt.
---
He had several times during the day; but
---
he had taken the
 risk carelessly.
---
, let them, he had said.

---
the
 reality of the scene was so much intenser than any of
 his prefigurings.

---
that he felt
---
he had not half enough
 considered the point
---
He had not
 expected.
---
Should he go on, and?

---
He could not bring himself.
---
who already despised him
---
He actually blushed
 at the thought, and.

---
that
 his sentiments of dislike towards Weatherbury should
 have led him
---
But Troy was never more clever than when absolutely
 at his wit's end.
---
He hastily thrust aside the curtain
 dividing his own little dressing space from that of the
 manager and proprietor, who now appeared as the
 individual called Tom King as far down as his waist, and
 as the aforesaid respectable manager thence to his toes.

---
"" said Troy.

---
that he'll perform it just
 the same without speaking
---
The proprietor shook his head.

---
said Troy, firmly.

---
it would be
 extremely awkward to offend his leading man just at
 this time
---
half- awake
 gatekeeper in his tasselled nightcap denies,
---
Coggan uttered!"
---
Poorgrass smiled delightedly
 with a nice sense of dramatic contrast between our
 hero, who coolly leaps the gate, and halting justice in
 the form of his enemies, who must needs pull up
 cumbersomely and wait to be let through.
---
At the
 death of Tom King, he could not refrain from seizing
 Coggan by the hand, and whispering, with tears in his
 eyes," Of course he's not really shot, Jan --  only
 seemingly!"
---
And, nothing could restrain Poorgrass
 from lending a hand, exclaiming,."
---
as he asked Jan,"
---
For
 many a year in Weatherbury, Joseph told, with the air
 of a man who had had experiences in his time,.
---
that he
 touched with his own hand the hoof of Bess
---
Meanwhile Troy had added a few touches to his
 ordinary make- up for the character
---
though he had felt faint qualms
 on first entering
---
, the metamorphosis ously" lining" his face with a wire rendered him safe from
 the eyes of Bathsheba and her men.
---
Nevertheless, he
 was relieved.

---
Troy had taken his part very
 quietly this time,; and.
---
when, whilst
 standing at the edge of the circle contiguous to the first
 row of spectators, he observed within a yard of him the
 eye of a man
---
Troy
 hastily shifted his position, after having recognized in
 sworn enemy, who still hung about the outskirts of
 At first Troy resolved to take no notice and abide
 by circumstances.
---
That he had been recognized by
 this man
---
Then the great objection he had felt to
 allowing.
---
that knowledge of his present occupation would
 discredit him still further in his wife's eyes
---
news of his proximity to precede him to
 Weatherbury in the event of his return, based on a
 feeling, returned
 in full force
---
Moreover, should he resolve
---
his being alive and
---
he was
 anxious to acquire a knowledge of his wife's temporal
 affairs before deciding which to do.

---
In this dilemma Troy at once went out to recon-
 noitre.
---
It occurred to him.
---
He had put on a thick beard borrowed from the
 establishment, and
---
this he wandered about the fair-
 field.
---
as he was

---
fenced of from the body of the tent by a
 luncheon- bar, behind which the host himself stood
 bustling about in white apron and shirt- sleeves, and look-
 ing as if he had never lived anywhere
---
Troy stood at the entrance to the booth, where a
 gipsy- woman was frying pancakes over a little fire of
 sticks and selling them at a penny a- piece, and.
---
He could see
 nothing of Pennyways, but
---
he soon discerned Bathsheba
 through an opening into the reserved space at the
 further end.
---
Troy thereupon retreated,.
---
He could hear
 Bathsheba's voice immediately inside the canvas
---
A warmth overspread his
 face
---
He wondered.
---
To get at the root of
 the matter, Troy took a penknife from his pocket and
.
---
Close to this he placed his face,
---
He made
 another hole a little to one side and lower down, in a
 shaded place beside her chair,.

---
Troy took in the scene completely now.
---
the owner of the male voice was Boldwood,
 who had apparently just brought the cup to her,
 Bathsheba,,, and
---
he was obliged
---
as he gazed in
---
Troy found.
---
unexpected chords of feeling to be stirred
 again within him
---
some minutes before he could counteract his sudden
 wish to go in, and
---
Then he thought.
---
who had always looked down upon him

---
him to be a strolling player
---
Were he
---
himself known
---
to make
, that chapter of his life must at all risks
 be kept for ever from her and from the Weatherbury
 people, or
---
his name would be a byword throughout the
 parish.
---
He would be nicknamed" Turpin" as long as
 he lived.
---
Assuredly before he could claim her these few
 past months of his existence
---
" said Farmer Boldwood.

---
It was great neglect in that man.
---
if it had not been for him
---
Troy scrutinized her cheek,
 and and the
 white shell- like sinuosities of her little ear.
---
when at this moment Pennyways
 entered the tent
---
Troy trembled: .
---
here was his scheme
 for respectability at once
---
He was about
 to leave his hole of espial, attempt to follow Pennyways,
 and find out if the ex- bailiff had recognized him, when
 he was arrested by the conversation, and found he was
 too late.

---
" Excuse me, ma'am." said Pennyways;"."

---
this man was evident
---
; in
 fact, he was continually coming to her with some tale
 or other.

---
, by which he might creep into favour at the
 expense of persons maligned
---
said Pennyways, confidently.
---
He
 stooped over the table,.
---
" YOUR husband is here
---
I've seen him.
---
This he folded small, and
---
Pennyways, then, with a laugh
 of derision, tossed it into her lap, and,,
.

---
though he had not been able to see what the ex- bailiff
 wrote
---
that the note referred
 to him
---
that he could think of
---
" Curse my luck!" he whispered,
 and.
---
Meanwhile Boldwood said,--
"?
---
He wants.
---
me to recommend him, or
---
He's always doing that."

---
The moment had come for saving his game,
 and
---
Troy impulsively felt!
---
that he would play the card,

---
For yet another time he looked at the fair hand, and
 and
---
the blue veins of the
 wrist,: how familiar it all was to him
---
in which he was such an adept
---
Then, with
 the lightning action, he
 noiselessly slipped his hand under the bottom of the
 tent- cloth, which was far from being pinned tightly down.
---
Troy then slid down on the outside of the rampart,

---
His object was now.

---
as he should choose
---
Troy reached the tent door, and
---
One or two men were speaking of
 a daring attempt that had just been made to rob a
 young lady by lifting the canvas of the tent beside her.

---
His chagrin and disappointment at dis-
 covering its worthlessness would be a good joke
---
the four bowed old men with grim countenances and
 walking- sticks in hand, who were dancing" Major
 Malley's Reel" to the tune
---
Behind these stood
 Pennyways.
---
Troy glided up to him,, and

---
with a mutual glance of
 concurrence the two men went into the night together.





---
that Oak should take the place of Poor-
 grass in Bathsheba's conveyance and
---
that Joseph
 was suffering from his old complaint, a multiplying eye,

---
But Oak had found himself, and
---
so many cares relative to
 those portions of Boldwood's flocks that were not
 disposed of, that Bathsheba, without telling Oak or
 anybody, resolved to drive home herself, as she had
 many times done from Casterbridge Market, and trust
 to her good angel for performing the journey un-
 molested.
---
Boldwood assured
 her.

---
, since he
 was her own managing- man and servant
---
Boldwood mounted his horse, and.
---
who
 so persistently loved on to his own injury and per-
 manent gloom
---
Hence her pity for the man had betrayed Bathsheba into an injudi-
 cious considerateness of manner, which appeared
 almost like tenderness, and.

---
He soon found an excuse for advancing from his
 position in the rear, and.
---
when Boldwood said suddenly
 and simply--

---
, Oak's usefulness to them both, and other
 indifferent subjects," Mrs. Troy, you will marry again some day?"

---
Yet your late husband
 has been dead nearly one year, and--
---
that his death was never, and
---
A man saw.
---
him drowning, too
---
No
 reasonable person has any doubt of his death; nor

---
From the first, I have had a strange
 uaccountable feeling that he could not have perished,
 but
---
that I shall see
 him no more
---
, the creaks of
 Boldwood's saddle and gig springs were.
---
Boldwood ended the pause.

---
Every
 dog has his day
---
to
 you before HE was anything, and
---
" Boldwood pleaded.
---
" But, Mr. Boldwood-- six years--"
" Do you want?"

---
My husband
 may be living,."

---
I am a
 middle- aged man, willing to protect you for the
 remainder of our lives.
---
His tone was so excited that she almost feared him
 at this moment, even whilst she sympathized.
---
vividly his outburst on the Yalbury Road, and shrank
 from a repetition of his anger:--

---
" I will never marry another man-- but
---
that I
 never shall love you as much as a woman ought to love
 a husband
---
if my husband should not come back
---
He said nothing further."

---
till he
 added: "
---
something
 occurred in the course of their labours which led Oak
 to say, speaking of Boldwood
---
He'll never forget you,
 ma'am, never."

---
what Boldwood had asked her, and
---
how he was
---
that, he'll go out
 of his mind
---
" said Gabriel, gravely.

---
I hold that man's future in my
 hand
---
His career depends entirely upon my treatment
 of him.
---
said Oak,"; but.

---
that his life is a total blank whenever
 he is n't hoping for' ee
---
His natural manner has always been dark and strange,
.
---
WITH OAK
 time, even if Mr. Troy does not come back again,!
---
which
 he may not impossibly do
---
However he came to dream of it
---
Perhaps it would be an uncommon agreement for a
 man and woman to make
---
said Oak, slowly.
---
In fact the very
 thing to marry en
 under any condition, that is, your not caring about him
 --."
---
" Love is an utterly bygone, sorry, worn-
 out, miserable thing with me-- for him or any one else."

---
Well, your want of love seems to me the one thing
 that takes away harm from such an agreement with him.

---
to do wi' it, making ye long to over-
 come the awkwardness about your husband's vanishing,
 it mid be wrong; but
---
a cold- hearted agreement to oblige
 a man seems different, somehow.
---
-- that I once seriously injured
 him in sheer idleness
---
If I had never played a trick
 upon him
---
, he would never have wanted.

---
if I could only pay some heavy damages in money
 to him for the harm I did, and
---
When a
 rake gambles away his expectations, the fact does n't make him the less liable.

---
that my own scruples, and the fact that in the
 eye of the law my husband is only missing, will keep
 any man from marrying me until seven years
---
that all depends upon whe'r you
 think, as everybody else do, that your husband is
 dead
---
what would have brought him back long before
 this time
---
if he had lived
---
But why do n't ye ask Mr. Thirdly's
 advice on how to treat Mr. Boldwood?"

---
., I
 never go to a man who deals in the subject pro-
 fessionally.
---
said
 Oak, with a grave smile.

---
ex-
 pected any reply from Gabriel more satisfactory than
 that she had obtained.
---
Oak had not once
 wished her free that he might marry her himself--."

---
Yet he might have
---
if he might speak of it
---
that Boldwood
 was
---
that
 Boldwood should be the giver
---
The log
 to form the back- brand of the evening fire
 was the uncleft trunk of a tree, so unwieldy that it could
 be neither brought nor rolled to its place; and accord-
 ingly two men were to be observed dragging and heaving
 it in by chains and levers as the hour of assembly drew
 near.
                      
---
I have not spoken to Mr.
 Boldwood since the autumn,, but."

---
I should seem to he rejoicing when I am
 solemn all the time
---
III
 Boldwood was dressing also at this hour.
---
A tailor
 from Casterbridge was with him,.

---
for the
 first time in his experience Boldwood was not, but now no philosophic or
 hasty rebuke whatever was provoked by this man for
 attaching as much importance to a crease in the coat
 as to an earthquake in South America.
---
Boldwood at
 last expressed himself nearly satisfied, and.

---
just as Oak came in

---
" Oh, Oak." said Boldwood.
---
" to be here," said Gabriel, quietly.
---
"" said Oak.
---
His tone had sunk to
 sadness.

---
Boldwood approached Gabriel, and
---
as Oak tied the
 neckerchief
---
said Oak, with
 faint bitterness.
---
to have shifted our
 positions: I have become the young and hopeful man,
 and you the old and unbelieving one.
---
" he said, in an impulsive whisper.

---
" Seven years." murmured Oak.

---
"!" he said, with im-
 patience.
---
since he vanished,

---
Never!" said Boldwood, vehemently.

---
IV
 Troy was sitting in a corner of The White Hart
 tavern at Casterbridge, smoking and drinking a steaming
 mixture from a glass.
---
Pennyways entered.

---
" Well, have you seen him?"
---
Troy inquired,.

---
" He wadn' at home.
---
because a man appears and
---
, he should be liable for anything.

---
If a man changes his
 name and so forth, and
---
takes steps to deceive the world
 and his own wife, he's a cheat, and
---
Troy had laughed,
 but
---
" that he said,?
---
There's a deal of
 feeling on his side seemingly, but
---
that she've not so much as spoke to him
---
How-
 ever, she's not fond of him-- quite offish and quite care
 less."

---
" He smoked on awhile, and
"

---
Oak is head man still
---
, is n't he?"

---
He manages everything."

---
" Twill puzzle him any other man
 of his compass!"

---
well he's pretty independent
---
" to
 captivate Mr. Boldwood, I suppose.
---
I dread the
 risk of wounding him by staying away."Anyhow, ma'am,.'
---
Mr. Boldwood should ask you
 ----"
" Liddy-- none of that
---
Boldwood," I want--
 that little arrangement we made about your share in the
 farm
---
said Oak, hastily.
---
But you have behaved like a man, and I, as a
 sort of successful rival- successful partly through your
 goodness of heart--."

---
", thank' ee" said Oak,
 hurriedly.
---
"; other
 men have, and
---
Oak then left him.
---
He was uneasy on Boldwood's
 account,.

---
for he saw anew
---
that this constant passion
 of the farmer made him not the man he once had

---
As Boldwood continued awhile in his room alone--
 ready and dressed to receive his company--
---
the mood of
 anxiety about his appearance seemed, and
.
---
He looked out
 of the window, and.

---
Then he went to a locked closet, and.
---
But
 he lingered.
---
Boldwood's eyes dwelt upon its many sparkles a long
 time,.

---
though that its material aspect concerned him

---
Boldwood closed the box,.

---
who was his indoor factotum
---
The old man came at the
 same moment to the foot of the stairs.

---
is it Mrs. Troy?
---
A reserved and sombre expression had returned to
 Boldwood's face again, but
---
it poorly cloaked his feel-
 ings; and
---
when he pronounced Bathsheba's name
---
his
 feverish anxiety continued.
                   
---
as he went down the stairs
---
" said Troy to Pennyways,
"."

---
He was buttoning on a heavy grey overcoat of
 Noachian
---
which was pulled down
 over his ears
---
Pennyways snuffed the candle, and?
---
deliberately inspected Troy

---
then looked up
 and to go then" he
 said.

---
Faith, I'd even bide-- a single man of the name of Francis.
---
" All nonsense!" said Troy, angrily.
---
But what man on earth was!"

---
if he has her there
---
Pennyways now felt.
---
himself to be in something of a
 difficulty
---
if he would secure the patronage of her husband
---
" he said, as a saving sentence."
---
said Troy, after
 emptying his glass in one draught as he stood.'
---
HORAE MOMENTO


 OUTSIDE the front of Boldwood's house a group of
 men stood in the dark, with their faces towards the door,
.

---
He was seen in Casterbridge this afternoon
---
"-- so the
 boy said.
---
His body was never found,."

---
" Perhaps he do n't mean.
---
" said another
 man.

---
If he's alive and here in the neighbourhood
---
", he
 means mischief."
---
He'll drag her to the dogs."

---
" O no; he'll settle down quiet enough."
---
what
 the man was made of
---
Be ye any of Boldwood's workfolk?"

---
He peered into their faces.

---
,
" have ye heard this strange tale?"
" What-- that about Sergeant Troy being seen, d'ye
 mean, souls
---
, here Laban
 comes himself,' a b'lieve.
---
, every man busied with his
 own thoughts,.
---
the wellknown form of
 Boldwood was seen in the rectangular area of light
---
Boldwood walked slowly down the path.

---
" one of the men whispered,.
---
as he neared
 them
---
"-- he'll go in again
 directly.
---
He would think it unseemly o' us to be
 loitering here.

---
Boldwood came on, and.

---
passed by the men without
 seeing them,
---
He paused, leant over the gate, and.
---
low words come from him
---
He said this to himself, and
---
Boldwood hastened back to the door, and;
 and.

---
Boldwood compressed his emotion to mere welcome
---
:
 the men marked her light
---
: he took her into the house; and.

---
it was like that with
 him
---
" said one of the men.
---
that fancy of
 his was over long ago
---
n't he should know."
---
Troy was in -- -- 
---
since he
 came here
---
when, pausing, he turned suddenly to his companions
 and
---
Troy's face was almost close to the
 pane, and
---
he was looking in.
---
Not only was he looking in,
 but
---
he appeared, the voices of
 the interlocutors being those of Oak and the maltster.

---
"" said
 the old man.
---
Although he made believe'
---
Farmer Boldwood being such a fool at his time of life
 as to ho and hanker after thik woman in the way' a do,

---
The men, after recognizing Troy's features, withdrew
 across the orchard as quietly.
---
" It gave me quite a turn-- his face.
---
William ought
---
He's
 oldest."

---
Why, he'll go on
 to her himself in a few minutes, ye'll."

---
that he will
---
" O no; I sha n't speak to Mr. Boldwood.
---
When he opened it
 the hum of bustle.
---
as he closed it
 again
---
Each man waited intently, and.
---
if he took
 interest in the scene,
---
where
 he started from and
---
So the men entered the hall, which was the room
 selected and arranged for the gathering because of its
 size.
---
The younger men and maids were at last just
 beginning to dance.
---
" he said.
---
what he was about to say
---
" to get an opportunity of speaking
 to you" said Boldwood.
---
"?" he said, eagerly.

---
" Boldwood
 knew;
 but"
---
he had proved.
---
, said Boldwood.

---
There is considerable doubt of his death, and
---
"; a blissful loving intimacy of six years, and
 then marriage-- O Bathsheba, say them!" he begged in
 a husky voice, unable to sustain the forms of mere
 friendship any longer.
---
If he does not return
---
Boldwood had come close to her side, and
---
now he
 clasped one of her hands in both his own, and.

---
he said more quietly, but.
---
And Boldwood slipped the ring on her finger.

---
though Boldwood kept her hand
 yet
---
Boldwood pressed her hand, and.
---
"" he said.
---
He left the room, and.

---
when he thought
---
Boldwood was standing by the fireplace,
 and he, too,.

---
that he scarcely saw anything,
---
you are in doubt about, men
---
?" he said.

---
Mrs. Troy has come downstairs."
---
One of
 the men opened it instantly, and.
"
---
Mrs. Troy is wanted.
---
" he said, on returning.

---
said the man by the door.

---
said Boldwood.

---
Troy, wrapped up to
 his eyes.

---
as we have seen him
---
that he
 was in the neighbourhood
---
Those recognized him instantly;
 those who did not were perplexed.
---
Boldwood was among those who did not notice that
 he was Troy.
---
he repeated,
 cheerfully," and!"

---
Even then Boldwood did not
 recognize.

---
who had once before broken in
 upon his bliss
---
that the impersonator of Heaven's persistent
 irony towards him,, scourged him, and
---
Troy began:
---
Boldwood
 recognized him now.

---
Troy turned to Bathsheba.
---
her dark eyes
 fixed vacantly upon him,
---
Then Troy spoke.
---
Troy went across to her.

---
" he said,

---
formed him.

---
Troy stretched out his hand.
---
This visible dread of
 him seemed, and
---
he seized her arm and
.
---
Whether his grasp pinched her, or

---
whether his mere touch was the'cause
---
In bewilderment they turned their eyes to Boldwood.

---
, Boldwood's face of gnashing despair had changed.

---
a frenzied look had gleamed
 in his eye
---
He had turned quickly,.

---
Troy fell.
---
The distance apart of the two men was
 so small that the charge of shot did not spread in the
 least, but.
---
He uttered
 a long guttural sigh
---
-- there was a contraction-- an exten-
 sion-- then his muscles relaxed, and
---
he lay still.

---
Boldwood was seen through the smoke
---
he had, meanwhile, in some way
---
Samway his man was the first to see this, and
.

---
Boldwood had already twitched the handkerchief, and

---
Boldwood gasped.

---
Then he broke from Samway,.
---
He put on his hat,
.





---
nobody
 thinking of preventing him
---
Here he walked at
 an even, steady pace over Yalbury Hill, along the dead
 level beyond, between
 eleven and twelve
---
strips of white paving upon which his step echoed
.
---
as his passed along
---
He turned to the right, and.
---
Boldwood stepped forward, and.
---
when, after a delay, another man
 came
---
Boldwood entered, and
---
the door was closed
 behind him, and
---
he walked the world no more.

---
Boldwood's merrymaking became known to
 all.
---
Of those out of the house Oak was one of the
 first to hear of the catastrophe, and
---
when he entered
 the room, which was
---
about five minutes after Boldwood's
 exit, the scene was terrible.
---
the men were bewildered as to what to do.
---
his head pillowed in her
 lap,
---
Troy recumbent in his wife's lap formed now the sole
 spectacle in the middle of the spacious room.

---
when he entered
---
Mr.
 Boldwood has shot my husband."

---
almost before he had comprehended anything beyond
 the briefest abstract of the event,
---
he had

---
Not till ridden more than a mile did it occur to him by sending some other man
 on this errand, remaining himself in the house.
---
that he
 would have done better
---
What
 had become of Boldwood?
---
He should have been
.
---
Was he mad--
---
Then how had Troy got there?
---
Where had he come
 from?
---
How did this remarkable reappearance effect
 itself when he was supposed by many to be at the
 bottom of the sea?
---
Oak had in some slight measure

---
been prepared for the presence of Troy by hearing a
 rumour of his return just before entering Boldwood's
 house; but
---
before he had weighed that information,
---
he rode on, in the excitement of these self- inquiries
.

---
Aldritch, the surgeon; and more than three hours
 passed between the time at which the shot was fired
 and that of his entering the house.
---
Oak was addition-
 ally detained in Casterbridge through having to give
 notice to the authorities of what had happened; and

---
he then found.

---
that Boldwood had also entered the
 town, and
---
In the meantime the surgeon, having hastened into
 the hall at Boldwood's
---
He went on to the back of the house,
.

---
where he discovered in the kitchen an old man, of
 whom he made inquiries
---
" him took away to her own house, sir,
---
"
 said his informant.

---
"?" said the doctor.
" Mrs. Troy.'
---
he met
---
" done?" he said.

---
When he was brought
 home and
---
Oak entered with the parson at this moment, and

---
anybody in the world may see him now.
---
where
 Oak and the parson still waited
---
which had been useless in Troy's
 case
---
Oak, finding
 from the bulletins that nothing really dreadful was,.
---
The
 groups consisted of a throng of idlers, a party of
 javelin- men, and two trumpeters, and in the midst

---
Joseph,,"
 said Coggan, as they walked.
---
" said Poorgrass.
---
as
 if I would read his very soul
---
there was mercy
 in his eyes-- or."

---
said Coggan,.
---
Twill disturb his  mind more than anything."

---
as if he were a show
---
to weigh him in the balances," I said
 in my reflectious way," and.
---
if he's found," and
---
, so
 be it unto him
---
,
 A man ought
---
; though the speech
 of some men is rumoured abroad as though by nature
 formed for such.
---
every man bide at home
---
That he had been from the time of Greenhill Fair
 until the fatal Christmas Eve in excited and unusual
 moods; but
---
who had been intimate
 with him
---
that there had shown
 in him unequivocal symptoms of the mental derange-
 ment which Bathsheba and Oak, alone of all others
 and at different times, had momentarily suspected
---
when Oak entered from Caster-
 bridge with tidings of the kiln glow shone upon
 it,
---
he would do
---
Boldwood,, had pleaded guilty, and
.

---
that Boldwood had not been morally
 responsible for his later acts.
---
for Boldwood had
 never made many friends over the counter
---
The shops
 thought it very natural that a man who, by importing
 direct from the producer, had daringly set aside the
 first great principle of provincial existence, namely
 that God made country villages to supply customers
 to county towns, should have confused ideas about
 the Decalogue.
---
The prompters were a few merciful
 men who had perhaps too feelingly considered the
 facts latterly unearthed, and the result
---
At
 that time Gabriel came from Casterbridge Gaol,.
---
whither
 he had been, and
---
When past the last
 house he heard a hammering, and
---
lifting his bowed
 head
---
he looked back for a moment.
---
Over the chimneys
 he could see the upper part of the gaol entrance,.
---
He with-

---
drew his eyes quickly, and.

---
when he reached home
---
" Gabriel said, wearily."
---
I've been with him more than two
 hours."

---
he REALLY was out of his mind
---
when he
 did it
---
Oak replied."
---
" No." said Oak.
---
"; but I
 could n't stay in town any longer-- after seeing him too,

---
is n't he?"

---
his life will be spared
---
said Coggan.

---
Gabriel's anxiety was great that Boldwood might be
 saved, even though in his conscience he felt that he
 ought to die; for there had been qualities in the farmer
 which Oak loved.
---
than forth he yode.
" We shall soon know now, one way or other.
---
In other pace" said
 Coggan, and
---
"" said Gabriel.

---
He's not.'
---
" Hurrah!" said Coggan, with a swelling heart."
---
First came the words of
 Troy himself:--
 ERECTED BY FRANCIS TROY
 IN BELOVED MEMORY OF
 FANNY ROBIN,
 WHO DIED OCTOBER9,18--,
 AGED20 YEARS.

---
Mr.
 Oak." exclaimed
---
" A few minutes, ma'am." said Oak, respectfully.

---
" said Gabriel.
---
At length Oak
 said,
---
But he feared, and?"

---
as I
 wished Mr. Oak
---
" said Oak.

---
Gabriel murmured.

---
when he saw the date
---
Oak walked after her.
---
he said, with hesitation.

---
Oak stammered out.

---
" But it is understood everywhere that you are going
 to take poor Mr. Boldwood's farm on your own account."

---
said Gabriel, in a
 distressed tone.
---
Good afternoon,
 ma'am" he concluded, in evident anxiety, and
---
there
 occurred to Bathsheba several incidents of latter in-
 tercourse with him, which, trivial
---
He argued on
 her side,
 had at last like.

---
more evidence of his
 want of interest in her was forthcoming.
---
as he had hitherto done during
 her seclusion
---
that instead of entering the small parlour or office
 waiting, or
 leaving a memorandum, Oak never came at all
---
Whenever he wanted directions he sent a
 message, or note with neither heading nor signature, to
 which she was obliged to reply in the same off- hand
 style.
---
that the sub-
 ject of which the season might have been supposed
 suggestive-- the event in the hall at Boldwood's; but
---
instead, an agonizing con-
 viction that Oak was the ringleader of the
 recusants.
---
There he was, as usual,.
---
But on seeing Bathsheba turn, he
 looked aside, and
---
as he got beyond the gate
---
, he
 made one, and.

---
It was a formal notice
 by letter from him that he should not renew his engage-
 ment with her for the following Lady- day.

---
that the
 possession of hopeless love from Gabriel, AFTER ALL
 grown
---
Since Troy's death Oak
 had attended all sales and fairs for her,.
---
Gabriel
 opened the door, and the moon shone upon his fore-
 haad.
" Mr. Oak."
---
" Yes; I am Mr. Oak.
---
" said Gabriel.
---
" Oak replied, with some awkwardness.
"
---
Oak placed two or three for her.

---
down sat he, the fire dancing
 in their faces, and upon the old furniture
 all a- sheenen
 Wi' long years o' handlen
---
,
 that formed Oak's array of household possessions, which
 sent back a dancing reflection in reply.
---
he said, simply.
---
The
 top and tail o't is this-- that I am sniffing about here,
 and waiting for poor Boldwood's farm, with a thought
 of getting you some day."

---
Gabriel looked her long in the face, but
---
Bathsheba,"
 he said,!"

---
"" said Gabriel, with a low laugh of joyous-
 ness.
---
" anybody so provoking
 he said,.
---
that I, as
 an unmarried man, carrying on a business for you as a
 very taking young woman
---
" And quite right too." said Oak.
---
He accompanied her up the hill,.

---
This good- fellowship-- CAMARADERIE--  usually occurring
 through similarity of pursuits, is unfortunately seldom
 because men and
 women associate, not in their labours, but in their
 pleasures merely.
---
Those had been Bathsheba's words to Oak one
 evening, some time after the event of the preceding
 chapter, and
---
he meditated a full hour by the clock upon
 how to carry out her wishes to the letter.

---
he said
 to himself at last."
---
On a dark night, a few days later, Oak came with
 mysterious steps from the surrogate's door, in Caster-
 bridge.
---
On the way home he heard a heavy tread in
 front of him, and,.
---
him to be
 Coggan
---
when he heard his lone
 voice among certain hard words of the Psalms,
---
whither
 no man ventured
---
" Well, good- night, Coggan." said Oak,"."

---
" Oh!" said Coggan, surprised;?"

---
It seemed rather ungenerous not to tell Coggan,
 under the circumstances,
---
for Coggan had been true as
 steel all through the time of Gabriel's unhappiness about
 Bathsheba, and
---
Gabriel said,"?"

---
said Coggan,.
"
---
said Oak,.
---
" Yet I must tell him to-
 night,, and."

---
for he's working so far off
---
said Coggan.

---
Then he'll come out,
 and
---
Coggan
 advanced boldly, and.
---
" He's not at home, and
---
Coggan stepped.

---
Who's t'other man, then
---
" Only a friend." said Coggan.

---
he's wanted
---
" Say to meet mistress near church- hatch
 to- morrow morning at ten." said Oak, in a whisper.

---
" That he must come without fail, and."

---
"" said Coggan.

---
" said Oak.
---
So Coggan delivered the message.
---
" Mind, het or
 wet, blow or snow, he must come' Tis
 very particular, indeed.
---
Coggan retired.
---
Then Gabriel went home,
 and.
" Liddy."
---
Farmer Oak is coming
 here!"

---
Nevertheless,
 at twenty minutes to ten o'clock, Oak came out of his
 house, and

---
A man puts out,
 and.
---
An observer must have
 been very close indeed to discover that the forms under
 the umbrellas were those of Oak and Bathsheba, arm- in-
 arm for the first time in their lives, Oak in a greatcoat
 extending to his knees, and Bathsheba in a cloak that
 reached her clogs.
---
that Farmer Oak should go there,,

---
since
 he had as yet neither money, house, nor furniture worthy
 of the name,
---
though he was on a sure way towards them
---
Oak, laughing," I knew
---
;"
 Oak took up the light and.
---
Those bright boys, Mark Clark and Jan, are at the
 bottom of all this."
---
said Oak.
---
Here's long life and happiness
 to neighbour Oak and his comely bride!"

---
" Thank ye; thank ye all." said Gabriel.
---
Coggan, in a critical tone, turning to his
 companions
---
," the man hev learnt?"

---
how very youth-
 ful he is in wedlock as yet-- hey, neighbours all
---
Then Oak laughed, and
---
" said Joseph
 Poorgrass with a cheerful sigh;
" and
