   " Yea, many there be. 
---
Many also
     have perished
---
O
     ye men, how can it be.



---
they do thus?"--ESDRAS
---
The schoolmaster was leaving the village, and
---
everybody seemed sorry.

---
For the schoolhouse had been partly
 furnished by the managers, and. 
---
the only cumbersome article possessed
 by the master, in addition to the packing- case of books,
---
But the enthusiasm
 having waned.


---
The rector had gone away for the day,. 
---
who disliked the
 sight of changes
---
when
 the new school- teacher would have arrived and, and

---
everything would be smooth again
---
The blacksmith, the farm bailiff, and the schoolmaster himself were
.

---
The master had remarked.


---
who had been thoughtfully assisting in the
 packing
---
as they rubbed their chins
---
it could be put there, perhaps,."


---
till you've
 found a place to settle in, sir
---
" A proper good notion," said the blacksmith.


---
It was decided. 
---
The smith and the bailiff started
, and
---
if the truth must
 be told
---
The regular scholars,, stood at the present moment afar off, like certain historic
 disciples,.


---
Why do you go, sir?
---
" Ah-- that would be a long story. 
---
You would n't understand my reasons,
 Jude. 
---
You will, perhaps, when you are older."


---
You know, and a university degree? 
---
what a university
 is
---
My scheme, or dream, is, and. 
---
if my scheme is practicable at all
---
that being on the
 spot will afford me a better chance of carrying it out than I should
 have elsewhere
---
It was accordingly left in
 the school till the evening,; and
---
when more hands would be available for
 removing it
---
the schoolmaster gave a final glance round.


---
as the cart moved off
---
you can
---
if ever you come to
---
you hunt
 me out for old acquaintance' sake
---
The cart creaked across the green, and.
---
disappeared round the corner
 by the rectory- house
---
The well was as ancient as the village itself, and
---
There was a lining of green moss near the top, and nearer still the
 hart's- tongue fern.


---
that the schoolmaster had drawn at that well scores of times on a
 morning like this, and
---
The morning
 was a little foggy, and
---
interrupted by a sudden outcry
---
will ye, you idle young harlican!"


---
the well
 stood-- nearly in the centre of the little village, or rather hamlet
 of Marygreen
---
It was as old- fashioned as it was small, and
---
it rested in the lap of
 an undulating upland adjoining the North Wessex downs. 
---
as it
 was
---
Old, however, the well- shaft was probably the only relic of the local
 history that remained absolutely unchanged. 
---
dormered dwelling- houses had been pulled down of late years, and

---
many trees felled on the green. 
---
Above all, the original church,
 hump- backed, wood- turreted, and quaintly hipped, had been taken
 down, and
---
who had run down from London and back
 in a day
---
The site whereon so long had stood the ancient temple to
 the Christian divinities.




---
that had immemorially been the churchyard
---
the obliterated
 graves being commemorated by eighteen- penny cast- iron crosses
 warranted to last five years
---
Within the little lead
 panes of the window-- this being one of the few old houses left--
---
Having
 seen the school- master depart, they were summing up particulars of
 the event, and.

"
---
" Well ye med ask it, Mrs. Williams. 
---
since
 you was last this way
---
who answered
---
for' n, Belinda"( turning to the right)",
 and was took wi' the shakings for death, and.
---
as you
 know
---
, Caroline"( turning to the left)
---
" It would ha' been a blessing
! 
---
what's
---
The local washerwoman replied."


---
" Why did n't ye get the schoolmaster, and
---
It runs in our
 family rather. 
---
as it happened
---
after they were married
---
and then they only had one till--
---
for the
 Fawleys to take that step any more
---
a child o' my own, Belinda, till the split come
---
The brown surface of the field went right up towards the sky all
 round,. 
---
where it was lost by degrees in the mist that shut out the
 actual verge and accentuated the solitude
---
" How ugly it is here!"
---
The fresh harrow- lines seemed,. 
---
there really attached associations enough and
---
Every inch of ground had been the site, first or last,
 of energy, gaiety, horse- play, bickerings, weariness. 
---
Groups of
 gleaners had squatted in the sun on every square yard.
---
that had populated the adjoining hamlet
---
Love- matches
 had been made up there
 between reaping and carrying. 
---
who would not turn their heads by the next harvest;
 and
---
For them it was a lonely place,
 possessing, in the one view, only the quality of a work- ground, and
 in the other that of a granary good to feed in.


---
At each clack the rooks left off
 pecking, and.


---
They seemed,. 
---
which did not want them
---
They took upon more and more
---
they alighted
 anew.

" Poor little dears!
---
" You SHALL have some dinner--
 you shall. 
---
There is enough for us all. 
---
Farmer Troutham can afford
. 
---
you have some
---
They stayed and
---
as those lives were
---
The birds and Jude started up simultaneously, and
---
So it's'
---
if you say,
''
---
And you've been idling at the
 schoolmaster's too, instead of coming here, ha'n't ye, hey? 
---
That's
!"


---
how you earn your sixpence a day for keeping the rooks off my corn
---
till the field echoed with
 the blows, which were delivered once or twice at each revolution
---
the rooks going round and
---
that-- there was a good
 crop in the ground--
---
'em sow it--
---
the rooks could have a
 little bit for dinner-- and
---
you would n't miss it, sir-- and
---
This truthful explanation seemed.


---
the farmer had largely subscribed,
---
though that was keen enough
---
walked along the trackway
 weeping-- not from the pain,; not from the
 perception of the flaw in the terrestrial scheme, by which what was
 good for God's birds was bad for God's gardener; but
---
went homeward by a roundabout track behind a high hedge
 and across a pasture
---
as
 they always did in such weather at that time of the year
---
It was
 impossible to advance in regular steps without crushing some of them
 at each tread.


---
trees cut down or
---
that it hurt them; and late pruning,
---
when the sap was up
 and
---
the tree bled profusely,
---
as it may be called
---
This weakness of character,, suggested
. 
---
when the customer was gone
---
Well, how do
 you come
---
" Mr. Troutham have turned me away. 
---
the rooks have a few
 peckings of corn
---
And there's my wages--"


---
If you ca n't skeer birds
---
", what can ye do? 
---
do n't ye look so deedy! 
---
Farmer Troutham is not so much better than
 myself,. 
---
But' tis as Job said,'
---
Now they that are
 younger than I have me in derision
---
Not that you should have let. 
---
the birds eat
---
what Farmer Troutham
 planted
---
Of course you was wrong in that. 
---
But, oh no-- poor or'nary child-- there never was any sprawl on thy
 side of the family, and
---
" Lord! you ought. 
---
where the city of Christminster is
---
It is a place much too good for you ever
 to have much to do with
---
You did n't grow up hereabout, or
---
you would n't ask such as
 that. 
---
" How can I tell?"

" Could I go?"

" Lord, no!  We've never had anything to do with folk in Christminster, nor
 folk in Christminster with we."


---
The fog had. 
---
the position of the sun could be seen through it
---
Events did not rhyme. 
---
That mercy towards one set of creatures was cruelty towards
---
As you got older, and
---
yourself
 to be at the centre of your time, and not at a point in its
 circumference,
---
as you had felt
---
when you were little
---
, you were seized
 with a sort of shuddering
---
the noises and glares
 hit upon the little cell called your life
---
when there was nothing more to be done
---
Christminster lay.


---
Oh, well, out by there yonder;-- not I.  I've never had any business at such a place."


---
There was something
 unpleasant about the coincidence for the moment, but
---
The
 farmer had said
---
yet
 Christminster lay across it, and
---
the path was a public one. 
---
till the track joined the highway by a little clump of
 trees
---
Here the ploughed land ended, and
---
Not a soul was visible on the hedgeless highway, or on either side of
 it, and
---
the white road seemed. 
---
till it joined
 the sky
---
At the very top it was crossed at right angles by a green
" ridgeway"--the Ickneild Street and original Roman road through the
 district. 
---
This ancient track ran east and west for many miles, and
. 
---
But it was now neglected and
 overgrown.


---
Not far from the road stood a weather- beaten old barn of reddish- grey
 brick and tile. 
---
It was known as the Brown House by the people of the
 locality. 
---
" Well, my lad, and what may you want up here?"


---
where the city of Christminster is
---
if you please
---
" Christminster is out across there, by that clump. 
---
You can see
 it-- at least you can on a clear day. 
---
" You ca n't often see it in weather like this
---
" The time
 it is,
 and
---
when the sun is going down in a blaze of flame
---
it looks."


---
" The heavenly Jerusalem," suggested the serious urchin.

"
---
that might lie in the banks
 thereabout
---
that the ladder was still in its place, but
---
that finished their day's work and
---
It was waning towards evening
---
; there was still a faint mist, but
---
it
 had cleared a little except in the damper tracts of subjacent country
 and along the river- courses. 
---
But it was hardly
 likely that the air would clear before night. 
---
Christminster might be

---
Perhaps, the wish to see forwarded. 
---
People said
---
if you prayed
---
that,, things sometimes came to
 you,
---
even though they sometimes did not. 
---
the money came in by the next post
---
the money did not come;

---
that the breeches were made by
 a wicked Jew
---
This was not discouraging, and
---
In the course of ten or
 fifteen minutes the thinning mist dissolved altogether from the
 northern horizon,. 
---
as it had already done elsewhere, and
---
the westward clouds
 parted
---
about a
 quarter of an hour before the time of sunset, the sun's position being partially uncovered, and
---
the beams
 streaming out in visible lines between two bars of slaty cloud
---
The air increased in transparency with
 the lapse of minutes, till the topaz points
---
that were
---
It was Christminster, unquestionably;.


---
The spectator gazed on and on till the windows and vanes. 
---
The
 vague city became veiled in mist. 
---
that
 the sun had disappeared
---
The foreground of the scene had grown
 funereally dark, and near objects put on the hues and shapes of
 chimaeras.


---
that remutinied every night on
 board the bewitched ship
---
so that you could hardly see
---
the poor penny
 articles exhibited within, and
---
it must rain at Christminster too
---
that it rained so drearily there
---
Then the day came. 
---
It would be
 necessary, but
---
The project was duly executed. 
---
It was not late, only just after dusk, but
---
accompanied by a wind from the same quarter
---
a black north- east
 sky,, made the occasion
 dark enough. 
---
was not the lamps in
 rows,. 
---
No individual light was visible,.


---
the city seem distant but a mile or
 so
---
where the
 schoolmaster might be
---
who never communicated with anybody at
 Marygreen now
---
to wonder on the exact point in the glow he; who was as if dead to them here. 
---
as if it were a sweet liquor
---
now you are here,-- you, the very same."


---
breathed by
 me
---
, it seemed. 
---
Surely it
 was the sound of bells, the voice of the city,,
---
" We are happy here!"


---
only got back to it by a rough recalling
---
having reached the place by dint of half an
 hour's serpentine progress from the bottom of the immense declivity
---
They had a load of coals behind them-- a fuel that could only be got
 into the upland by this particular route. 
---
They were accompanied by a
 carter, a second man, and a boy, who now kicked a large stone behind
 one of the wheels, and.


---
the panting animals to have a long
 rest
---
while those in charge took a flagon off the load and
---
if they had come from Christminster
---
Heaven forbid, with this load!
---
"" said they.


---
" The place I mean is that one yonder." 
---
There do seem a spot a bit brighter in the nor'-east than
 elsewhere,."


---
Here a little book of tales,
 having brought them. 
---
before it grew dark
---
" Ah, young man" you'd have."


---
your head screwed on
 t'other way
---
before you could read
---
what they read there
---
" Oh, they never look at anything that folks like we can understand,"

---
the carter continued, by way of passing the time. "
---
when no two families
 spoke alike
---
They read that sort of thing as fast as a night- hawk
. '
---
And that's learning too, for.

---
there's wenches in the
 streets o' nights... 
---
You know
---
that they raise pa'sons
 there like radishes in a bed
---
though it do take-- how many years,
 Bob?--five years
---
if it can be
, and
---
they be, and
---
as they used
---
There,' tis their
 business, like anybody else's."


---
" But how should you know"


---
som'at coming
---
You must
 mind. '
---
Em lives on a lofty
 level; there's. 
---
As we be here in our bodies on this high ground
---
And some on'em be strong
 young fellows that can earn a'most as much in silver cups. 
---
As for
 music, there's beautiful music everywhere in Christminster. 
---
You med

---
you med not, but. 
---
you ca n't help
---
And there's a street in the place-- the
 main street-- that ha'n't another like it in the world. 
---
By this time the horses had recovered breath and bent to their
 collars again. 
---
The waggon turned
 into a cross- road,.

"
---
Well,' tis oonly what has come in my way
---
you be welcome to it.

---
A- getting about the world, and mixing with all classes of
 society, one ca n't help hearing of things. 
---
, that
 used,."


---
Would it be a spot in
 which, without fear of farmers, or hindrance, or ridicule
---
It is a city of light
---
The tree of knowledge grows there
---
" It is."


---
what you may call a castle, manned by scholarship and
 religion
---
" It would just suit me
---
that danced madly and
---
to be wearing an
 extraordinarily tall hat, a swallow- tailed coat, and a watch- chain
 threw around scintillations of sky- light as
 its owner swung along upon a pair of thin legs and noiseless boots.

---
so you'll have. 
---
if you keep alongside of me
---
Do you know?"


---
That comes of being a public
 benefactor."


---
Vilbert was an itinerant quack- doctor,,. 
---
The distances were enormous, and. 
---
you've been to Christminster, Physician?
---
" That's one of my
 centres."


---
" It's a wonderful city for scholarship and religion?"


---
" You'd say. 
---
who do the washing of the colleges
---
", that
 they may be able to read the New Testament in the original."


---
You must get a grammar of each tongue."


---
Whenever you do
---
", you say. 
---
that Physician Vilbert is the only
 proprietor of those celebrated pills that infallibly cure all
 disorders of the alimentary system, as well as asthma and shortness
 of breath
---
specially licensed by the
 government stamp
---
" Can you get me the grammars?"


---
you mine with pleasure--
---
which
 was giving him a stitch in the side
---
you'd better drop behind, my young man
---
if you'll remember, at every house in the village,
---
" Where will you be with the grammars?"


---
My movements are."


---
which is seen

---
if a supernatural lamp were held inside their transparent natures,

---
that heaven lies about them then
---
which the pedestrian did not diminish
 by a single unit of force
---
, the latter seemed. 
---
though with the lapse of the fortnight the evenings
 had grown light
---
who are you? 
---
The quack mentally registered these with great care.

"
---
" You were,."


---
that you used
---
before you took your
 degree
---
, you see,
---
You haven't brought' em!"


---
But you must get me some more orders from sick people, and
---
which is sometimes vouchsafed to children
---
the gift of
 sudden insight showed him
 all at once what shoddy humanity the quack was made of. 
---
There was. 
---
The disappointment was followed by an interval of blankness. 
---
that required money
---
it gave Jude
 a lead. 
---
it would be
 sure to reach the desired eyes. 
---
which would have the charm of being mellowed by
 the university atmosphere
---
It was
 necessary to act alone.


---
which happened
---
The piano was
---
At last a packet did indeed arrive at the village, and
---
that it contained two thin books
---
what is
 everywhere known as Grimm's Law-- an aggrandizement of rough rules to
 ideal completeness
---
that the words of the required
 language were always
---
who had the art
---
being furnished by the books
---
such art
 aforesaid
---
that the packet bore the postmark of
 Christminster
---
which chanced
---
that there was no law of transmutation,

---
( there was, in some degree, but
, but
---
the grammarian did not recognize it)
---
that every word in both
 Latin and Greek was
---
This was! 
---
Latin and Greek, then, was it
 this grand delusion
---
What brains they must have in Christminster and the great schools!

---
as the
 little sun- rays continued
---
But nobody did come,
; and
---
because nobody does
---
During the three or four succeeding years a quaint and singular
 vehicle might have been discerned,.


---
under which the ideas lay
 in those dusty volumes called the classics
---
the
 business of the little cottage bakery had grown in consequence. 
---
as the horse had learnt the road and
---
as the case might be
---
The only copies were old Delphin
 editions,. 
---
because they were superseded, and therefore cheap
---
,
 bad for idle schoolboys, it did
---
The hampered and lonely itinerant conscientiously
 covered up the marginal readings, and. 
---
which had already been

---
thumbed by hands possibly in the grave,."


---
the people of the neighbourhood
 began
---
( such they
 considered)
---
There were murmurs. 
---
Then a private
 resident of an adjoining place informed the local policeman. 
---
that it was the constable's duty
---
The only thing to be done was,
 therefore,. 
---
as
 anybody loomed in the distance
---
The light had changed, and
---
The sun was going
 down, and
---
the full moon was rising simultaneously behind the woods in
 the opposite quarter. 
---
that, in a moment of the same impulsive emotion which years
 before had caused
---
that nobody was in sight
---
Phoebe silvarumque potens Diana!
---
The horse stood still.


---
which had led
 to such a lapse from common sense and custom in one who wished
---
the strange forgetfulness, next
 to being a scholar, to be a Christian divine
---
It had all come of
 reading heathen works exclusively. 
---
Certainly there seemed little harmony between this pagan
 literature and the mediæval colleges at Christminster, that
 ecclesiastical romance in stone.


---
obtained by post from a
 second- hand bookseller
---
which
 might spread over many years
---
What was most required by citizens? 
---
An income from any work in preparing the first would be too meagre
---
They built in a city
---
that contained the
 scholar souls
---
metal
 not being available, and
---
There was a stone- mason of a humble kind in Alfredston, and
---
It was fine, warm, and soft summer weather, and
---
It being the end of the week
---
This was true
---
there was only one dialect all the same
---
These things are only a beginning. 
---
there
 get
---
that my present knowledge will appear to me
---
one of those colleges
 shall open its doors to me--
---
whom now it would spurn
---
Well, on second thoughts, a bishop was
 absurd. 
---
,
 the books I have not been able to get hold of here:
---
"  The sounds were expressed in light
 voices on the other side of the hedge, but
---
it is that which tells....
---
Yes, Christminster shall be my
 Alma Mater; and
---
as though the future were thrown thereon by a magic
 lantern
---
what it was-- a piece of flesh, the characteristic
 part of a barrow- pig, which the countrymen used for greasing their
 boots,
---
as it was useless for any other purpose
---
Pigs were rather
 plentiful hereabout,.


---
On the other side of the hedge was a stream,
---
On the further side of the stream stood a
 small homestead,
---
a garden and pig- sties attached
---
which they were washing in the running water
---
One or two pairs of
 eyes slyly glanced up, and
---
last
 been attracted, and
---
, they braced themselves
 for inspection by putting their mouths demurely into shape and
 recommencing their rinsing operations with assiduity.


---
can you
---
Nor I," the second answered.

" said the third.


---
" If I had thrown anything at all, it should n't have been THAT!"

" Pooh! 
---
And they laughed and.


---
YOU did n't do it-- oh no!
---
That you'll never be told
---
" Whoever did it was wasteful of other people's property."


---
" Oh, that's nothing."


---
But you want
---
if you like to.
---
will you come to the plank above here?"


---
which, so far, had no sort of premeditation in it
---
when the last intention of
 their lives is
---
what is lying there
---
They walked in
 parallel lines, one on each bank of the stream, towards the small
 plank bridge. 
---
This production of dimples at will was a not unknown
 operation, which many attempted, but only a few succeeded in
 accomplishing.


---
They met in the middle of the plank, and
---
as it clutched the rail of the bridge
---
; till,
 moved by amatory curiosity
---
" You do n't think_
---
who naturally does n't want anything

---
What made
---
either of the others throw it
---
it was I, mind
---
me wash the
 innerds for black- puddings and such like
---
They talked a little more and a little more,. 
---
as they stood
---
It is scarcely an exaggeration.

---
though the words had

---
" Ah, you should see me Sundays!
---
That's
---
for you to think on
---
There's nobody after me just now,
." 
---
though there med
---
the dimples disappeared.


---
Will
 you let me?"


---
" To- morrow, that is?"


---
which had

---
which so precisely formulated only a few minutes
 earlier
---
Well, it's only a bit of fun
---
that to common sense there was something lacking, and
---
which made it necessary
---
It had
.

---
one might momentarily see an
 inscription on a wall before being enshrouded in darkness. 
---
And then
 this passing discriminative power was withdrawn, and
---
though you med think so
---
to be a scholar, they say."


---
Do n't you think
 it, my child
---
" Oh, do n't ye! 
---
You need n't try! 
---
What did you stay
? 
---
, if you did n't want un
---
Whether you do or
---
whether
 you do n't
---
as you courted
 on the bridge
---
who has sloughed off its winter
 skin
---
which was very winning, apart from
 promises
---
Indeed, it would be
 impossible,.


---
This seemed and
---
HÊ KAINÊ DIATHÊKÊ was no more heeded, and
---
A smell of piggeries came from the back, and the grunting
 of the originators of that smell. 
---
as
 it evidently wore to the speaker
---
The door was opened and
---
would n't you
---
We'll walk up to the Brown House and back
---
", we can
 do it in half an hour."


---
all the misgivings vanished
---
First they clambered to the top of the great down
---
they were struck by the rising of a dense volume of smoke
 from the neighbourhood of the little town which lay beneath them at a
 distance of a couple of miles
---
It is a fire
---
's run and
---
It is not
 far!"


---
They started off down the hill almost at
 a trot; but
---
on gaining level ground at the bottom, and walking a
 mile, they found.


---
that the spot of the fire was much further off than
 it had seemed
---
Having begun their journey, however, they pushed on; but
---
it was not
 till five o'clock. 
---
The conflagration had been got under
 by the time they reached it, and
---
after a short inspection of the
 melancholy ruins they retraced their steps--.


---
their course lying
 through the town of Alfredston
---
they entered an inn of an
 inferior class, and
---
As it was not for beer
---
they
 had a long time to wait. 
---
who kept hisself up so particular
---
The latter
 guessed and
---
what was being said,
---
They sat and. 
---
which hung on the wall
---
The
 whole aspect of the scene had
---
which
 few places can produce like a tap- room on a Sunday evening when
 the setting sun is slanting in
---
no liquor is going, and
---
It began. 
---
They could not wait longer,
---
really, for the
 tea, they said. 
---
" Yet what else can we do?
---
" It is a
 three- mile walk for you."


---
we can have some beer
---
Somehow it seems odd."


---
" But we did n't."


---
" No, we did n't."
---
which was
---
" What's the matter with it
---
, it is true
---
it is bad, and
---
But this seems
 all right."


---
" How much you know!
---
they
 went on their way. 
---
It was now nearly dark, and as soon as they had
 withdrawn from the lights of the town they walked closer together,
 till they touched each other. 
---
" Now we are well together, dear,
---
are n't we
---
Thus they walked. 
---
till they reached the foot of the upland, where they
 could see the white highway ascending before them in the gloom
---
Before they
 had climbed
---
far they were
---
" These lovers-- you find'em out
---
Are we lovers
---
" You know best."


---
" But you can tell me?"


---
They walked now no longer arm in arm but,. 
---
After all, what did it matter
---
since it was dark
---
When they were
---
half- way up the long hill they paused as
 by arrangement, and
---
They reached the top, and

---
" You can keep your arm there,
---
if you would like to
---
It was nine o'clock.


---
if only for a minute, as it would seem so
 odd otherwise,
---
that the door was opened
---
several neighbours sitting round
---
They all spoke in a congratulatory manner, and.


---
But that sense was only temporary:
---
what hitherto adhered to so strictly, as to not wasting a
 single minute of time day by day? " Wasting!" 
---
It depended on your
 point of view
---
As
 the sun had only just risen
---
it was possible. 
---
that nobody had passed
 there since
---
as they had stood
---
which nothing could fill
---
A pollard willow stood close to the place,
 and.

---
that willow was different from all other willows in the world
---
which must elapse
---
Utter annihilation of the six days would have been.


---
that marked it
---
the scene of
 the kiss, and the willow, though chattering freely on
 the subject to the other two
---
" You've got if you han't!"

---
" It's well!"


---
What med
---
be the right way
---
" Oh you do n't know
---
-- you do n't!
---
" said Sarah, the third girl.


---
" On my word I don't!--No further"

 know!"


---
"" said Anny.


---
as one may say
---
Well, we can teach
' ee som'at then, as well as you us."


---
that's honourable and serious- minded
---
turning up their eyes
 in drollery began
---
although nobody was near
---
" Nothing venture nothing have! 
---
You'd be safe enough with yours. 
---
they'd
 get married at all
---
that three young unfattened pigs had
 escaped from their sty by leaping clean over the top, and
---
The animals took advantage
 of the pause by doubling and bolting out of the way.


---
" They were only put in this morning!
---
They are wanting! 
---
Will you shut
 the garden gate, dear, and. 
---
Every now and then they ran together,
. 
---
The first pig was

---
got back promptly; the second with some difficulty; the third a
 long- legged creature, was more obstinate and agile. 
---
me take your hand, darling
---
" You are getting out of
 breath." 
---
they trotted along together.


---
This comes of driving'em home
---
" They always know
 the way back. 
---
if you do that
---
They ought."


---
as the pursuers had entered and
---
As soon ascended to the
 top of the high ground it became apparent. 
---
that they would have
---
if they wished
---
" It is no good!
---
before we get
 there
---
It do n't matter. 
---
now we know
---
They'll see and. 
---
it is ours,
---
" We've run all this way for nothing. "
---
Well-- why do n't
 you speak, deary?"


---
It was all up hill."


---
They were in absolute solitude-- the most apparent of all solitudes,
 that of empty surrounding space. 
---
They were, in fact, on one of the
 summits of the county, and the distant landscape around Christminster
 could be discerned from where they lay. 
---
" A
 sort of a-- caterpillar, of the most loveliest green and yellow you
 ever came across!"


---
you must come here
---
where it branches off
---
How stupid you are!
---
you to let
---
me kiss you
---
" What's the matter?
---
Have you heard that lately-- quite lately?
---
But it has been known a long time. 
---
you and Father to go and
---
how the Edlins be, this
 evening after tea
---
Or no-- there's evening service at Fensworth
---
-- you
 can walk to that."


---
What's up to- night, then?"


---
when you are here
---
If it is fine."


---
we med as well,
---
since you wish
---
who had now
 for weeks ceased
---
They wandered up the slopes. 
---
till they reached the green
 track along the ridge, which they followed to the circular British
 earth- bank adjoining, Jude thinking of the great age of the trackway,
 and of the drovers who had frequented it,
---
probably before the Romans
 knew the country
---
Up from the level lands below them floated the
 chime of church bells. 
---
Presently they were reduced to one note,
 which quickened, and.


---
Now we'll go back
---
Why are you in such a hurry to go in to- night? 
---
It is not
 near dark."


---
it locked
---
Ah-- they are gone to church
---
" Now, you'll come
 in a moment?
---
" We shall be all alone."


---
Indoors they went. 
---
No, it was too late
---
they sat down-- naturally enough close together.

"
---
" What is it?"
---
it will get hatched in less than three
 weeks.
---
I am hatching a very rare sort.  I carry it
 about everywhere with me, and"

" Where do you carry it?"


---
which was wrapped in wool
---
it being a piece of pig's bladder,
 in case of accidents
---
you do n't come near me
---
it broke,
---
I do n't want."

" Why do you do such a strange thing?"


---
" It's an old custom. 
---
it is natural
---
" It is very awkward for me just now
---
" It serves you right. 
---
There-- that's all you can have of me"


---
" That's very shabby of you!"


---
" You should have catched me a minute ago!

---
Then there was a little struggle,. 
---
You must find me first!
---
It was now dark inside the
 room, and
---
the window revealed.




---
It was some two months later in the year, and
---
the pair had met
 constantly during the interval. 
---
it will be better both for you and for me
---
some things had

---
But it is never too late
 to mend."


---
How do you know
---
it is not too late
---
" That's all very well! 
---
if you desert me
---
You KNOW
---
as yet, you know
---
if that's the case
---
But, of course, we must
 marry! 
---
What other thing do you think?"


---
deary, perhaps you would go away all the more
 for that, and
---
" You knew better! 
---
even
 three, of marrying
---
It is a complete smashing up of my plans-- I mean
 my plans before I knew you, my dear. 
---
But what are they, after all!

---
Certainly we'll marry:
---
we must!"


---
The banns were put in and. 
---
The people
 of the parish all said. 
---
what a simple fool young Fawley was
---
who guessed the probable state of affairs,

---
Those, declared. 
---
who married them
---
The
 parson seemed. 
---
And so,
 standing before the aforesaid officiator, the two swore. 
---
that at every
 other time of their lives till death took them
---
, they would assuredly
 believe, and
---
precisely as they had believed
---
desire, felt, and

---
What was
---
as remarkable
 as the undertaking itself was the fact that nobody seemed at all
 surprised at what they swore.


---
that it would have been far better. 
---
The prospects of the newly married couple were certainly not very
 brilliant even to the most sanguine mind. 
---
a
 town- lodging, it would be necessary
. 
---
for them to live
---
But the urgent need of adding to income in ever so
 little a degree caused,. 
---
it was a long way to walk to and from Alfredston every day.

---
that all these make- shifts were temporary
---
where so much of the hard labour at
 Greek and Latin had been carried on
---
What-- it was n't your own
---
" Oh no-- it never is nowadays with the better class."


---
But in the country it is supposed
. 
---
Besides, you've enough of your own, surely?"


---
as country notions go
---
"

" Barmaid at Aldbrickham?"

" Well, not exactly barmaid-- to draw the drink at a
 public- house there-- just for a little time; that was all. 
---
Some
 people put me up to getting this, and
---
The more you have the better in Aldbrickham, which is a finer town
 than all your Christminsters. 
---
Every lady of position wears false
 hair--."


---
the barber's assistant told me so
---
Others, alas, had an
 instinct towards artificiality in their very blood, and. 
---
even though the prospects of the household ways and means
 are cloudy
---
As usual they laughed before talking
---
; the world seemed funny to them
 without saying it.


---
So it turned out a good plan,!"
---
you see
---
you ought."


---
" And when do you expect?"


---
" Oh, Arabella, Arabella; you be a deep one! 
---
well, that's
 clever
---
-- it's a real stroke of genius! 
---
It is a thing I never thought
 o', wi' all my experience! 
---
not that one could sham it
---
" Do n't you be too quick to cry sham! ' Twasn't sham. 
---
Whatever it was!"


---
it was a trick-- a double one, by
 the Lord
---
What can'em do otherwise? 
---
Married is
 married."


---
The occasion was one evening at bedtime, and
---
than they had been in the
 earlier weeks of their acquaintance
---
" There is no harm in
 it, but
---
you were awake
---
" How countrified you are! 
---
That's nothing."


---
" Where did you learn it?"


---
They used; but
---
now they wo n't. 
---
My face was fatter
 then."


---
if they do
---
How do you know?"


---
-- that public- house experience accounts for your knowing about
 the adulteration of the ale when we went and had some that Sunday
 evening
---
" You ought and.

---
There was not much to do at home, and, so
---
" You'll soon have plenty to do now, dear,"


---
wo n't you?
---
" How do you mean?"


---
"

" When will it be? 
---
Ca n't you tell me exactly, instead of in such
 general terms as you have used?"


---
" There's nothing to tell. 
---
" It was a mistake."


---
" How can that be?"


---
if it had not been for the news you gave me,
---
which made it necessary
 to save you, ready or no
---
What's done
---
there was silence
 between them.


---
while ordinary notions prevailed
---
But how came they?


---
But
 the marriage remained.

 The time arrived for killing the pig and the butchering
 was timed,.


---
as it was light in the morning
---
The night had seemed strangely silent. 
---
that the ground was covered with
 snow-- snow rather deep for the season
---
, it seemed,
---
a few flakes still
 falling
---
You must get up and. 
---
if you want

---
At half- past six, the time of appointment with the
 butcher, the water boiled, and
---
Challow come
---
" No."

 They waited, and
---
it grew lighter, with the dreary light of a snowy
 dawn. 
---
" Then we must put it off. 
---
It is only the water boiled for nothing.

---
The snow may be deep in the valley."


---
There's no more victuals for the pig. 
---
We always do it the last day or two,. 
---
Well-- you must do the sticking
---
"-- there's no help for it. 
---
as it is
 such a big pig
---
rather Challow had done it. 
---
we can use
' em."


---
Of course you sha n't do it
---
since it must
 be done
---
who, beginning with a squeak of surprise, rose to
 repeated cries of rage
---
together
 they hoisted the victim on to the stool, legs upward, and
---
The animal's note changed its quality. 
---
It was not now rage, but.


---
the
 cry of despair; long- drawn, slow and hopeless
---
" A creature"

" Do n't be such a tender- hearted fool! 
---
There's the sticking- knife--
 the one with the point. 
---
whatever you do
---
That's
 the chief thing."


---
You must not
---
" The meat must be well bled, and. 
---
We shall lose a shilling a score! 
---
if the meat
 is red and bloody
---
Just touch the vein, that's all. 
---
Every good butcher keeps.

---
un bleeding long
---
, however the meat may
 look
---
the butchers do
---
all the time--"

" Do be quiet, Arabella, and
---
However unworkmanlike the deed, it had been mercifully done. 
---
The
 blood flowed out in a torrent instead of in the trickling stream. 
---
The dying animal's cry assumed its third and final
 tone, the shriek of agony
---
un stop that
---
" Such a noise will bring
 somebody or other up here, and" 
---
people to know
---
we are

---
The pig was instantly silent,.


---
That's better
---
It is a hateful business!"
---
" Pigs must be killed."


---
The animal heaved in a final convulsion, and, despite the rope,
. 
---
A tablespoonful of black
 clot came forth
---
, the trickling of red blood having ceased for some
 seconds.


---
That's it
---
" Artful creatures-- they always
 keep back a drop like that as long as they can!"


---
The last plunge had come so unexpectedly, and

---
There's a waste, all through you!"


---
only about a third of the whole
 steaming liquid was left in it
---
, the main part being splashed over
 the snow, and-- to those who
 saw it as other than an ordinary obtaining of meat. 
---
What's God got
---
" Poor folks must live."


---
Suddenly they became aware of a voice at hand.


---
which was husky
---
The voice,,
 came from the garden- gate, and.

"
---
they saw
---
the burly form of Mr. Challow leaning over the gate
---
' Tis well for' ee to stand there and!
---
your being late the meat
---
" Owing
 to is!'
---
half spoiled
---
" You should have waited a bit and. '
---
that you be in at present, ma'am
---
Tis risking yourself
 too much.
---
You need n't be concerned about that
---
that the deed would have amounted to the same thing
---
if carried out by
 deputy
---
how the matter was
---
nothing
 have
---
there was nothing the matter
---
The suggestion was horridly
 unpleasant, and
---
" An apprentice's wages are not meant,
 as a rule, my dear."


---
" Then you should n't have had one."


---
That's too bad,."


---
when you know
---
how it came about
---
Doctor Vilbert thought so. 
---
" I'll declare afore Heaven that I thought what I told you.
 It was a good job for you!"


---
that it was n't
 so
---
it was not your fault
---
those women friends of yours gave
 you bad advice. 
---
If they had n't, or
---
you had n't taken it
---
, we should at
 this moment have been free from a bond. 
---
which, not to mince matters,

---
It may be very sad, but
---
it is true."


---
" Who's been telling you about my friends? 
---
" But you shall
---
" Pooh-- I'd rather not."

-- you ought to. 
---
It is mean of' ee not to!"


---
us say no more about it
---
That was nothing
---
The
 risk is hers."


---
when effects stretch
---
What ought
---
""

" Given me time... 
---
Why do you fuss yourself about melting down that
 pig's fat to- night? 
---
It wo n't keep."


---
which was Sunday
---
the renewed work recalled the conversation
---
which had

---
" That's the story about me in Marygreen
---
, is it?

---
you were

" You might have thrown them
 aside, but

if you had liked

as to soiling them like that, it is
 disgusting!" 
---

It was a fine
---
Sunday morning, dry, clear and frosty, and
 the bells of Alfredston Church could be heard on the breeze from the
 north. 
---
People were going along the road,
---
These pedestrians turned
---
One of the passers said in
 mock terror:"!"


---

---
that all
 was over between them, and
---
that it mattered, or
---
Their lives were ruined

; ruined by the fundamental error of their matrimonial union:
 that of having based a permanent contract on a temporary feeling
 which had no necessary connection with affinities that alone render
 a lifelong comradeship tolerable
---
you be a queer lot as husbands and wives
---
, whose infirmities
 daily increased.

"
---
" Who's been telling you that?"
---
it spoken of, and
---
There is n't much. 
---
they
 parted. 
---
It was coming home from Alfredston market,-- on the hill by the Brown House barn--. 
---
when you were a
 baby
---
that they had their last
 difference, and
---
The Fawleys were not made for
 wedlock
---
: it never seemed. 
---
There's sommat in our
 blood that wo n't take kindly to the notion of being bound to do what
 we do readily enough if not bound. 
---
That's."


---
why you ought

" Where, did you say?"

" A little further on-- where the road to Fenworth branches off, and
 the handpost stands. 
---
A gibbet once stood there.

The frost continued,

---
though it was not particularly sharp, and
---
the larger stars overhead
 came out slow and. 
---
this did

---
the ice
 making sharp noises
---
The cracking repeated itself; but. 
---
the cracking had ceased.

It was curious

Of course that was it

Drinking was the regular, stereotyped resource of the despairing
 worthless.

On entering and sitting down the sight of the picture of Samson and
 Delilah on the wall caused.

The house was in darkness.

though the marks of pig- dressing, of fats and
 scallops, were visible

that,, the materials themselves had been taken away

A line was

They had at

 the southern road was materially increased by the auction

It is a small lot of stuff that was knocked down to me at a cottage
 sale out on the road to Marygreen

You shall have it for a shilling."


---
that it would be better otherwise,
,
---
which perhaps was true
---
It seemed.

A little further on was the summit whence Christminster, or
---
A milestone, now
 as always, stood at the roadside hard by.

if the inscription were legible still, and

THITHER
              J. F.
   [ with a pointing finger]


 The sight of it, unimpaired,
---
Bene agere et
 loetari_--to do good cheerfully
---
The ultimate impulse to come had had a curious origin
---
Grey- stoned and
 dun- roofed, it stood within hail of the Wessex border, and almost
 with the tip of one small toe within it, at the northernmost point of
 the crinkled line along which the leisurely Thames strokes the fields
 of that ancient kingdom. 
---
The buildings now lay quiet in the sunset,
 a vane here and there on their many spires and domes giving sparkle
 to a picture of sober secondary and tertiary hues.


---
whose spirit was touched to
 finer issues than a mere material gain. 
---
after inquiry took a room in a suburb nicknamed" Beersheba,
---
It was a windy, whispering, moonless night. 
---
The breeze ruffled and
, but
---
It was a college,. 
---
which no lamplight reached
---
Close to this college was another; and
 a little further on another;
---
as it
 were with the breath and sentiment of the venerable city
---
A bell began, and
---
: it was meant
 for a hundred.


---
When the gates were shut, and
---
The minutes
 passed,
---
fewer and fewer people were visible, and
---
High
 against the black sky the flash of a lamp would show crocketed
 pinnacles and indented battlements. 
---
whose very existence seemed

---
to be forgotten, there would jut into the path porticoes, oriels,

---
doorways of enriched and florid middle- age design, their extinct air
 being accentuated by the rottenness of the stones. 
---
It seemed
 impossible that modern thought could house itself in such decrepit
 and superseded chambers.


---
that could be read and
---
who had spent their youth within these
 reverend walls, and
---
whose souls had haunted them in their maturer
 age
---
The
 brushings of the wind against the angles, buttresses, and door- jambs
 were. 
---
as the passing of these only other inhabitants, the tappings
 of each ivy leaf on its neighbour were as the mutterings of their
 mournful souls, the shadows as their thin shapes in nervous movement,

---
In the gloom it was.


---
The streets were now deserted, but
---
who has

---
who
 is still among us
---
who apologized for the Church
 in Latin
---
as it were, like an actor in a melodrama who apostrophizes the
 audience on the other side of the footlights
---
what voice it
 was, and
---
what it betokened
---
as solid
 flesh went
---
; a real and local voice:

" You've been a- settin' a long time on that plinth- stone, young man.

---
What med you be up to?"


---
spoken by them in muttering utterances
---
Another voice was. 
---
that of the Corn Law convert, whose phantom just seen in the quadrangle with a great bell
---
my impression is
---
that my duty towards a
 country threatened with famine
---
which has been the
 ordinary remedy under all similar circumstances
---
that that should be resorted to
 now,
---
whatever quarter it may come
---
you
 can never deprive me of the consciousness

" How
 shall we excuse the supine inattention of the Pagan and philosophic
 world,

which were presented by
 Omnipotence

 awful spectacle, and."

 Necessary meditations on the actual, including the mean
 bread- and- cheese question, dissipated the phantasmal for a while, and
. 
---
deemed
 by many of its professors
---
that the
 colleges had treacherously changed their sympathetic countenances:

---
some were pompous
---
; some had put on the look of family vaults above
 ground
---
; something barbaric loomed in the masonries of all. 
---
whose muscles had
---
who knew their beginning
---
they were difficult or easy in
 the working,
---
What at night had been perfect and ideal
---
was by day the more or
 less defective real. 
---
Cruelties, insults, had been
 inflicted on the aged erections. 
---
They were
 wounded,,.


---
the
 morning had nearly gone. 
---
It was, in one sense,. 
---
whose name had been given him at
 Alfredston
---
The yard was a little centre of regeneration. 
---
These were the ideas in
 modern prose.

---
which the lichened colleges presented in old poetry
---
Even some of those antiques might have been called prose. 
---
when they
 were new
---
They had done nothing but wait, and.

---
mullions, transoms, shafts, pinnacles, and battlements standing on
 the bankers half worked, or
---
They were marked
 by precision,
---
that
 mediævalism was as dead as a fern- leaf in a lump of coal
---
in which Gothic
 architecture and its associations had no place. 
---
The deadly animosity
 of contemporary logic and vision towards so much of was
---
But the saints and prophets in the window- tracery, the paintings
 in the galleries, the statues, the busts, the gargoyles, the
 corbel- heads-- these seemed. 
---
on which the past is
---
as it had been called
---
It was not till now,,
---
who had nothing to do from morning till night but to read
---
The conversation of some of the
 more thoughtful among them seemed oftentimes,,. 
---
But the future lay ahead after all; and
---
,
 colleges included
---
Those
 palaces of light and leading; some day look down on the
 world through their panes.


---
that nobody should know,

---
when the nights reeked

It contained

sitting on the grass
 beside a large square board whereon were fixed, as closely

as they
 could stand

 herbage

They seemed so very

The mistress of the house, Miss Fontover, was an elderly lady in
 spectacles,

which had occurred several years
 before this date

just as the other was

"," said
 Miss Fontover, looking round at the Gothic- framed prints of saints,
 the Church- text scrolls, and other articles which, having become too
 stale to sell, had been used to furnish this obscure chamber. 
---
" What
 is it? 
---
Where did you get them?"

there was enough
 diffused light from the street to show her the white plaster figures,
 standing on the chest of drawers in odd contrast to their environment
 of text and martyr, and the Gothic- framed Crucifix- picture that was
 only discernible now as a Latin cross
---
waking up, the figure thereon being
 obscured by the shades.


---
On one of these occasions the church clocks struck some small hour.

---
Till the sounds rolled with reverent loudness, as a book was heard
_
---
who carves the boss
 or knob of leafage
---
as if it were a degradation to do the second
 half of one whole

The next time was. 
---
There was a short
 morning service, and

when the parson entered

the half- dozen people forming the congregation
---
who had

immediately the worshipers began
:
---
it was in this holy spot,
. 
---
who was beginning
---
But it was also obvious
---
still more particularly the lonely evenings,
 dragged along
---
what was erratic, informal
---
A voice whispered.


---
the situation was growing immoral. 
---
It was quite
 impossible
---
when
 your heart's desire was seven
---
After all" it is not altogether
 an_ erotolepsy_
---
that is the matter with me, as at that first time.

---
it is partly a wish
 for intellectual sympathy, and a craving for loving- kindness in my
 solitude
---
that
 it was human perversity
---
It so happened.

---
Why-- that's my cousin Sue
---
when such a drama follows
---
they are read over by the purple
 or lurid light of it, all the more impressive, solemn, and in cases,
 terrible
---
They might have had such nice times together
---
so that the chance of companionship would be lost perhaps
 for ever
---
It was,.

---
However, it could not
 be helped now, and
---
The broad street was silent, and. 
---
although it was
 not late
---
they both converged towards the crossmark at the same
 moment. 
---
Before either had reached it
---
The voice, though positive and silvery, had been tremulous. 
---
They
 walked on in parallel lines, and,
---
the place
 being
---
where the carriers' carts stood in the daytime,
---
though there
 was none on the spot then
---
it would save time

---
if we were going
---
was
---
you chose
---
that the
 place was so horrid--
---
But is n't it
 funny?" 
---
You seem
---
" And you knew, and? 
---
That's unfortunate. 
---
Surely it is impossible! 
---
" Yes-- it is
---
As we are going
---
we go and
---
" It is not late."


---
they went along up a hill, and through some prettily
 wooded country. 
---
Presently the embattled tower and square turret
 of the church rose into the sky, and then the school- house.
---
They
 inquired of a person in the street, and. 
---
which had

---
You were one of my pupils
---

---
;
 but they number so many thousands by this time of my life, and."


---
It was out at Marygreen
---
And is this an old pupil, too?"


---
" No-- that's my cousin... 
---
" Ah-- yes!--I do dimly recall that incident."


---
" It was. 
---
very kind of you to do it
---
And it was you. 
---
who first started
 me on that course
---
On the morning you left Marygreen,
---
when your
 goods were on the waggon
---
, you wished me good- bye, and."


---
your
 scheme was
---
that a degree
 was the necessary hall- mark of one who wanted to do anything as a
 theologian or teacher
---
The idea was given up years ago."


---
It was that."


---
which brought me to this
 part of the country, and out here
---
" And your cousin, too."

 They entered the parlour of the school- house, where there was a lamp
 with a paper shade, which threw the light down on three or four
 books. 
---
so that they could see each other
 better, and
---
which from continued frictions shone a little at
 the shoulder- blades
---
They did not stay to supper,. 
---
before it grew
 late, and
---
the road was retraced to Christminster
---
Though they had
 talked of nothing more than general subjects
---
An exciting thought would make; and
---
It was with
 heart- sickness
---
Why must you leave Christminster?
---
can
 you do otherwise
---
" Yes-- they do. 
---
Though how large do they loom in the history of the
 world?
---
" Miss Fontover, one of the
 partners, is offended with me, and
---
" How did that happen?"


---
though it was my property
---
the end of it
 was but
---
" Why do n't you try? 
---
You once did
---
If you like it, and
---
go to a training college, and become a
 first- class certificated mistress, you get twice as large an income
 as any designer or church artist, and twice as much freedom."


---
We need n't quarrel
---
because our parents
 did
---
which operated
 without regard of consequences
---
The school- master was unprepared for such a proposal.


---
" was a second year's transfer,
---
as it is called,
---
" Of course your cousin would do, personally; but. 
---
quite, the salary being merely nominal
---
who took more and more warmly to the idea of tuition
---
both being modern erections
---
The arrangement had
 been concluded very quickly. 
---
who was
---
as these
 could only last till the next annual visit of H.M. Inspector
---
All such provisional arrangements, whose
 approval was necessary to make them permanent. 
---
what master- tradesman does not wish
---
It was a little over half- past eight o'clock in the morning and
---
A new emanation,
, seemed. 
---
The regulation was,
 indeed, not easy to evade, for there was no other sitting- room in the
 dwelling.


---
Sometimes-- it was arithmetic
---
that they were working
 at
---
Then it happened. 
---
that the children were

---
to which schools were admitted at
 a penny a head in the interests of education
---
They marched along
 the road two and
---
The afternoon was one of sun and dust, and
---
when they
 entered
---
the exhibition room few people were present but themselves.

---
The model of the ancient city stood in the middle of the apartment,
 and
---
showing the
 young people the various quarters and places known to them by name
 from reading their Bibles; Mount Moriah, the Valley of Jehoshaphat,
 the City of Zion, the walls and the gates, outside one of which there
 was a large mound like a tumulus, and on the mound a little white
 cross. 
---
The spot was Calvary.


---
as it is
---
that this model, elaborate, is a
 very imaginary production
---
How does anybody know? 
---
that Jerusalem was
 like this in the time of Christ
---
" It is made after the best conjectural maps, based on actual visits
 to the city as it now exists."


---
we have had enough of Jerusalem
---
we
 are not descended from the Jews
---
There was nothing first- rate about
 the place, or people, after all--,
 Alexandria, and other old cities."


---
as there was about Athens, Rome
---
what it is to us
---
almost
 hidden from view by the Mount of Olives
---
" Look at your cousin Jude,"
 continued the schoolmaster. 
---
we have had enough of
 Jerusalem
---
" These are your school- children,
 of course! 
---
that schools were admitted in the afternoons, and

---
you might come
---
How it carries one back
---
, does n't it! 
---
-- there are too many of that sort now!"
---
you are quite right
---
YOU believe in me
---
not
 the least conception what a complication building up thereby in the futures of both
---
The model wore too much of an educational aspect for the children not
 to tire of it soon, and. 
---
a little later in the afternoon they were all

---
Meanwhile the scholars and teachers moved homewards, and
---
you took no interest in the model, and
---
" It is more."


---
two days later, in the middle of the morning lessons,
 the latch of the door was softly lifted, and in walked my gentleman,
 the king of terrors-- to pupil- teachers.


---
; the inspector therefore came and. 
---
that an oft- dreaded moment
 had come
---
when the inspector had gone
---
there was a reaction, and
---
You ought
---
that one of the
 inspector's surprise- visits was imminent
---
You are the best teacher

---
that the evening was wet
---
The trees overhead
 deepened the gloom of the hour, and
---
On turning the corner and entering the village the first sight was that of two figures under one umbrella coming
 out of the vicarage gate. 
---
they had evidently
 been paying a visit to the vicar-- probably on some business connected
 with the school work. 
---
as they walked along the wet and
---
it
 remain,
---
who
 sank into the hedge like one struck with a blight
---
many a happy marriage had been made
 in such conditions of age. 
---
given by the thought.




---
the
 sight could not be revealed
---
The
 little bakery business had been sold to a neighbour, and
---
It was not till the time.

"
---
They were living here at that time. 
---
What
 made?"


---
' ee ask that
---
A pert little thing, that's. 
---
This is no sight for modest eyes!'"


---
And
 there'll be a worse thing,. 
---
if you, tied and
---
as you be
---
If your cousin is civil to you
---
what it is worth
---
But anything more than a relation's
 good wishes it is stark madness. 
---
it med bring' ee to ruin."


---
who must have been listening to the conversation,. 
---
when the vicar
 arranged readings and recitations
---
" There was a sound of revelry by
 night," and" The Raven"
---
if some real creature stood there--


   " Ghastly, grim, and ancient Raven,
      
---
what thy lordly name is
       on the Night's Plutonian shore
---
that you could see un a'most before your very eyes
---
You too,
 Jude, had the same trick as a child of seeming to see things in the
 air."


---
, you know
---
They'd try. 
---
But' a would n't come."


---
It being Sunday evening
---
some villagers were standing in a group in their best clothes. 
---
" Ye've got there right enough, then!"


---
" Why, to the seat of l'arning-- the' City of Light' you used! 
---
Is it all you expected of it?"


---
You are wrong, John
---
"; there is. 
---
It is a unique centre of thought
 and religion-- the intellectual and spiritual granary of this country.

---
All that silence and absence of goings- on is the stillness of
 infinite motion-- the sleep of the spinning- top,."


---
" Oh, well, it med
---
it med not. 
---
till
 it was time to come along home
---
You've j'ined a college by this
 time
---
" Just what we thought! 
---
Such places be not for such as you-- only for
 them with plenty o' money."


---
There you are wrong
---
" They are
 for such ones!"


---
It was decidedly necessary. 
---
" It would have been better at all,
 or... 
---
some arm to be stretched out from them
---
This hovering outside the walls of the
 colleges, as if expecting to
 lift me inside, wo n't do! 
---
What at first seemed. 
---
an
 opportunity occurred one afternoon,

---
who had been pointed out as the head of a particular college,
---
The gentleman came nearer, and
---
It seemed benign, considerate, yet
 rather reserved. 
---
what a wise thing it would be
---
from those whose
 physiognomies seemed. 
---
that they were appreciative and
 far- seeing men
---
When the letters were posted
---
they had not been sent
---
It is just one of those
 intrusive, vulgar, pushing, applications which are so common in these
 days
---
Perhaps that's!"


---
that it was perfectly absurd to expect,
---
What this meant
---
whether, as seemed possible, it was a practical
 move of the schoolmaster's towards a larger income, in view of a
 provision for two instead of one
---
was the only brilliant course. 
---
But to
 do this a good deal of coaching would be necessary, and much natural
 ability. 
---
The undertaking was hopeless.


---
me only get there
---
the rest is but a
 matter of time and energy." 
---
Well, all amounted to this,. 
---
that
 the whole scheme had burst up, like an iridescent soap- bubble, under
 the touch of a reasoned inquiry
---
It had
 windows. 
---
from which an outlook over the whole town and
 its edifices could be gained
---
which composed the ensemble
 of this unrivalled panorama
---
whose loss was now a maddening torture
---
that the reaction from the long strain subjected
---
it was night. 
---
that it
 bore the embossed stamp of one of the colleges
---
The communication was brief, and;
. 
---
though it really was from the master in person
---
It ran thus:


    BIBLIOLL COLLEGE.

   
---
SIR,--I have read your letter with interest; and,, I
    venture to think that you will have a much better chance
    of success in life by remaining in your own sphere and
    sticking to your trade than by adopting any other course.
   
---
it was true
---
Yet it seemed a hard slap after
 ten years of labour, and
---
That officer yawned,
---
whom
 nobody ever thought of now
---
It had more history than the oldest
 college in the city. 
---
It was literally teeming, stratified, with the
 shades of human groups, who had met there for tragedy, comedy, farce;
 real enactments of the intensest kind. 
---
Here the two sexes had
 met for loving, hating, coupling, parting
---
that the town life was a book of humanity infinitely
 more palpitating, varied, and compendious than the gown life
---
though they knew little of Christ or Minster
---
That was one of the humours of things. 
---
who did know
---
The floating population
 of students and teachers, both in a way, were not
 Christminster in a local sense at all.


---
A band was playing, and
---
the crowd walked
 about and every now and then
---
who made advances
---
whose head
 had just sent him the note.


---
The gates were shut, and, by an impulse
---
But the laugh was not a healthy one.

---
which had

In the evening the frequenters of the house dropped in one by one,
.

---
who appeared
---
There were present, too, some clerks, and a gown- and
 surplice- maker's assistant
---
who sported moral characters
 of various depths of shade,
---
who proved
---
The conversation waxed general. 
---
Christminster society was

---
, the dons, magistrates, and other people in authority
 being sincerely pitied for their shortcomings,
---
how
 they ought
---
while opinions on to conduct themselves and their affairs to be properly
 respected, were exchanged in a large- minded and disinterested manner
---
what they were for so many
 years
---
the others said
---
What
 I know is!"


---
if they'd give me a
 chance, and
---
they are not up to yet
---
that I'd lick'em on their own ground" Hear, hear!" said the undergraduates from the corner, where they
 were talking privately about the pups.


---
You always was fond o' books
---
", I've heard," said Tinker Taylor," and

---
what you state
---
there was;
---
You aim at the Church
---
If you are such
 a scholar
---
Canst say the Creed in Latin, man?

---
That was."


---
how they once put it to a chap down in my country
---
Just you shut up, Bower o' Bliss!
---
" I should think so!""" said one of the undergraduates.

---
The gentleman in the corner is going

---
said the surplice- maker.


---
You ca n't!

"" said Uncle Joe.


---
"!" said Tinker Taylor.


---
That's a fair offer
---

---
The barmaid concocted the mixture with the bearing of a person
 compelled to live amongst animals of an inferior species, and
---
who, having drunk the contents,
 stood up and
---
"

" Good!  Excellent Latin!" cried one of the undergraduates, who,
 however, had not the slightest conception of a single word.


---
A silence reigned among the rest in the bar, and
---
_"

" That's the Nicene

" And we
 wanted the Apostles'!"

" You did n't say so!

And every fool knows, except you,!"

 said Tinker Taylor.

Somebody threw down threepence

 and only one they had recognized.

" Which one of you knows?

It might have been the Ratcatcher's Daughter

The landlord, endorsed for harbouring
 queer characters,; but

to whom it seemed possible

when it was between ten and eleven o'clock

that a light was burning in
 a downstairs room,,,

rightly as it happened

Is it Jude? 
---
Yes, it is! 
---
Sue-- my heart is nearly broken,
 and! 
---
as it was

which ought
 but reverently

one hand holding the candle and

the meagrely furnished house afforded,. 
---
broken by
 grief and contrition
---
the only spot was Marygreen.

---
the distance
 being nearly twenty miles
---
while the people were at breakfast
---
whose whole life had been
 a struggle with material things
---
Refreshed by some breakfast
---
it was. 
---
It WAS hell--"the hell of conscious failure," both
 in ambition and in love. 
---
it was not so deep as this.

---
A mournful wind blew through the trees, and. 
---
Each ivy leaf overgrowing the wall
 of the churchless church- yard hard by, now abandoned,
---
the vane on the new Victorian- Gothic church in
 the new spot had already begun. 
---
Yet apparently it was not
 always the outdoor wind that made the deep murmurs
---
; it was a voice.

---
Presently the sounds ceased, and
---
a step seemed.

---
which was open,
---
It was a young clergyman.


---
you are Mr. Highridge
---
just come home; a fellow gone
 to the bad; though I had the best intentions in the world at one
 time. 
---
though this had, up
 till now
---
that folly is with me
---
the collapse of my
 university hopes one jot
---
The curate,, had grown deeply
 interested, and
---
If you feel a real call to the
 ministry, and
---
, you might enter the
 Church as a licentiate
---
Only you must make up your mind."


---
It was a new idea-- the ecclesiastical and altruistic life as distinct
 from the intellectual and emulative life. 
---
which had led on to the culminating vision of the
 bishopric
---
The old fancy had not been an ethical or theological enthusiasm at all,
 but a mundane ambition masquerading in a surplice. 
---
even though it might not have

---
which had no foundation in the nobler
 instincts;
---
which was purely an artificial product of civilization
---
who ate,
---
The sensual hind drank, and.


---
The human interest of the new intention-- and a human interest is
 indispensable to the most spiritual and self- sacrificing. 
---
There was a theological college at Melchester
---
As it would be necessary
---
Christmas had come and, and
---
till the days had
 lengthened
---
Neither had
---
; it was worse than the ecclesiastical designer's;
 worse than anywhere. 
---
This being
---
The
 day was foggy, and
---
The lofty
 building was visible as far as the roofridge;
---
above, the dwindling
 spire rose more and more remotely, till its apex.


---
The lamps now began, and
---
that numerous blocks
 of stone were lying about,
---
which signified
---
that the cathedral was

---
that this was an
 exercise of forethought on the part of a ruling Power,
---
It was
 an ancient edifice of the fifteenth century, once a palace, now
 a training- school, with mullioned and transomed windows, and a
 courtyard in front shut in from the road by a wall. 
---
The screens and subtleties of
 convention had likewise disappeared. 
---
That had plainly
 been dashed off in an impulse
---
which second thoughts had
---
You don't
---
You said enough to let me know what had
 caused it. 
---
It was

---
pruned by severe discipline
---
which that
 discipline had not yet been able to reach
---
they walked and. 
---
They were
 kept on very short allowances in the college, and
---
a dinner, tea, and
 supper all in one was the present.

---
whatever the house
 afforded,
---
which was not much
---
The place, however, gave them a
 delightful opportunity for a_ tête- à- tête_, and
---
nobody else being in the
 room,
---
they talked freely.


---
as it was at that date, and the rough
 living, and
---
to whom restraint was new
---
That was. 
---
When they had sat and

---
Your hands are rather rough, Jude
---
, are n't they
---
So would yours be."


---
if they held a mallet and
---
", you know. 
---
it is noble
---
", what would it matter? 
---
" You are wriggling out if it, Sue, and
---
it is n't quite kind!"


---
this reproof was deciding
---
you'll be angry
---
that's
---
This is:
---
that we shall then take a large double school in a great
 town
---
But of course it is right
---
-- you could n't have done
 better!"


---
you would be angry
---
you come
---
We had; and
---
we'll only
 correspond at long intervals, on purely business matters!"


---
" Your being engaged can make no difference to me
 whatever. 
---
us talk of it any more
---
It is quite spoiling our
 evening together. 
---
I have a perfect right to see you when I want to; and I
 shall!"

 What does it matter about what one is going to do
 two years hence!"


---
Shall we go and?"
---
when their
 meal was finished
---
" That's the centre of the town life now. 
---
The cathedral has had its
 day!"


---
How modern you are!"


---
" So would you be! 
---
if you had lived so much in the Middle Ages
---
The cathedral was a very good place
 four or five centuries ago; but
---
it is played out now... 
---
if you only
 knew
---
" Only you do n't
 know, from your point of view, or
---
you would n't think so
 much of me, or care whether I was engaged or not. 
---
Now there's just
 time for us to walk round the Close."


---
they parted. 
---
it did anything but.

---
which it was not
 so easy to get
---
as at Christminster, there being, as a rule,
---
hands being mostly
 permanent
---
which
 were very extensive
---
the whole interior stonework having been
 overhauled,
---
to be largely replaced by new
---
It might be a labour of
 years, and
---
it all done
---
, you know
---
Where shall we go?"


---
Wherever we can get to and
---
And then we can do Fonthill."


---
if we like-- all
 in the same afternoon
---
" Wardour is Gothic ruins-- and
---
It is a classic building-- Corinthian
---
" Ah-- that will do. 
---
We'll go."


---
Their conversation had run thus some few weeks later, and
---
next
 morning they prepared. 
---
There duly came the charm of calling at the college door!
---
that was rather enforced

---
," the screaming of the trains-- everything formed the
 basis of a beautiful crystallization. 
---
A matter
 of ten pounds spent in a drapery- shop,, would have set. 
---
The guard of the train thought.


---
they were lovers, and
---
That's a good intention wasted!"
---
They reached the park and castle and. 
---
, it grew reverent and.

---
It was evident.


---
from which one had one's self

---
When they came out a long time
---
as they had had something to eat
---
that as soon they should
 walk across the high country to the north of their present position,
 and
---
who was

---
they went,.


---
It was indeed open country, wide and high. 
---
They talked and. 
---
About half- way on their journey they crossed a main
 road running due east and west-- the old road from London to Land's
 End. 
---
They paused, and.


---
which had come over this once lively
 thoroughfare
---
while the wind dipped to earth and
---
hay- stems from the ground
---
They crossed the road and but
---
They had walked a good distance altogether, and
---
if they could
---
it would be rather awkward. 
---
For a long
 time there was no cottage visible on the wide expanse of down and
 turnip- land; but
---
presently they came to a sheepfold, and next to the
 shepherd,. 
---
that the only house near
 was
---
This they did, and
---
they were as civil as strangers
---
entered the house, can
 be.


---
when their only chance of rest and shelter lies in the favour of
 the householder
---
where the thatch is
---
that' twill soon be cheaper than thatch
---
They sat, and
---
the shepherd came in. "
---
But mid you be thinking o' getting back to Melchester to- night
 by train? 
---
Because you'll never do it in this world
---
, since you do n't
 know the lie of the country. 
---
even then the train mid be gone
---
They started up.


---
, you know,
---
The place is welcome to ye. '
---
Tis hard lying, rather, but
---
volk may do
 worse." 
---
Be you a married
 couple
---
you and I can lie in the outer chimmer. 
---
after
 they've gone through
---
You've lost this one now."


---
On consideration they decided, and.


---
while their entertainers were

---
" You only think
---
you do n't
---
you like it;: you are quite a product of
 civilization
---
Do you remember it so well? 
---
You seem."


---
You do n't know."


---
what's inside me
---
what you are
---
The shepherd aroused them the next morning,. 
---
It was
 bright and clear, and
---
the four miles to the train were accomplished
 pleasantly. 
---
When they had reached Melchester, and
---
They rang the great bell and.


---
" It is a new little photograph
 of me. 
---
Would you like it?"


---
the porter came. 
---
There seemed. 
---
who at this date filled
 the species of nunnery known as the Training- School at Melchester
---
which included the daughters of
 mechanics, curates, surgeons, shopkeepers, farmers, dairy- men,
 soldiers, sailors, and villagers
---
They sat in the large school- room
 of the establishment on the evening
---
word
 was passed round.

"
---
That excuse has been made a little too often in this school
---
The fact was. 
---
The affair had

---
the management had consequently been rough on
 cousins ever since.


---
At nine o'clock the names were called.


---
At a quarter past nine the seventy stood up" and. 
---
After prayers they went in to
 supper, and
---
Some
 of the students,, felt. 
---
that they
 would not mind
---
Hardly one among them
 believed in the cousinship.


---
Half an hour later they all lay in their cubicles, their tender
 feminine faces upturned to the flaring gas- jets which at intervals
 stretched down the long dormitories, every face bearing the legend
" The Weaker" upon it, as the penalty of the sex wherein they were
 moulded, which by no possible exertion of their willing hearts and
 abilities could be made strong while the inexorable laws of nature
 remain what they are. 
---
They formed a pretty, suggestive, pathetic
 sight, of whose pathos and beauty
---
they were themselves unconscious,
 and
---
, their minds would revert to this experience as to
 something which had been allowed to slip past them insufficiently
 regarded.


---
One of the mistresses came in, and. 
---
which, like all the rest,
 was ornamented with various girlish trifles,
---
Strictly
 speaking, relations' portraits only are allowed on these tables."


---
, you
 know
---
"

" You are sure' twas not the undergraduate?"


---
The lights were promptly extinguished, and.


---
When they awoke the next morning
---
when they had come up
---
After the early lessons by
 gas- light, in half- toilet, and to dress for
 breakfast, the bell of the entrance gate was heard.

---
The mistress of the dormitory went away, and.


---
that the principal's orders were
---
that nobody was
---
none of them coming out
---
When they had gone downstairs
---
they found
---
they then learnt and.


---
there to be
---
the seventy murmured
---
the sentence being
---
At this,, they thought, too
 severe. 
---
No notice was taken.

---
when the geography mistress began
---
You mean
---
that you are not going?
---
" to work" said the mistress at last.

---
that it has been ascertained
---
" I may as well tell you.  We have written to
 Christminster."


---
However, they remained stolid and motionless, and
---
as they sat,
---
one rushed
 in. 
---
nobody could tell,
---
as it was bounded by the river at the bottom, and

---
the side door was locked
---
They went and
---
, the casement between the
 middle mullions of which stood open. 
---
The lawn was again searched
 with a lantern,, but
---
every bush and shrub being examined
---
Then the porter of the front gate was interrogated,
 and
---
some ducks had come down the river from above
---
"" said a mistress.


---
which, added to the scandal of the year before,

---
More lanterns were procured, and
---
the river examined; and
---
then, at
 last, on the opposite shore, which was open to the fields
---
,
 the matron began.


---
Certainly somebody had thrown gravel. 
---
" Sue!"

" Yes-- it is! 
---
, the front
 door being opened merely by a knob which anybody could turn, as
 in most old country towns. 
---
What
 counterparts they were! 
---
Whatever have you done, darling
---
, the
 tender epithet slipping out unawares
---
Walked through the largest river in the county-- that's! 
---
They locked me up for being out with you; and
---
it seemed so
 unjust that I could n't bear it
---
" You must take off all your things! 
---
me
 see
---
And let-- you must borrow some from the landlady.
---
We are so near the
 school!"


---
that they'll come after me
---
" Then you must put on mine. 
---
You do n't mind?"


---
, you know. 
---
It is close here." 
---
because there was not
 room
---
for it to be otherwise
---
A clock struck half- past seven, and
---
, it is odd
---
that you should see me like this and
---
all
 my things hanging there
---
Will you dry my clothes now? 
---
It is not late yet."


---
" No, you sha n't,. 
---
if you are ill
---
You must stay here. 
---
Here's six of best brandy
---
Now you drink it,
 dear
---
since
 they had parted
---
Somebody knocked and
. 
---
It was the landlady.


---
whether you was in or not
---
if you would require supper
---
you've a young
 gentleman--
---
Will you bring
 supper up on a tray, and
---
they were far from dry. 
---
A thick woollen
 gown held a deal of water. 
---
as the steam from the garments went up
 the chimney
---
How do you feel now?"


---
What time is
 it? 
---
It is past ten."


---
" Is it really? 
---
where you are
---
" Yes; that's. 
---
what they would
 say
---
And what will you do?"


---
Perhaps you will be

---
The tea must have been green, or,
---
who had not taken
 any
---
" You called me a creature of civilization, or something,"

---
did n't you?
---
" It was very odd."


---
you should have done
 that
---
, because it is provokingly wrong
---
" You are very philosophical. 
---
' A negation' is profound."


---
" Is it? 
---
who has had no advantages
---
that all interest
 in the unwholesome part of those books ended with its mystery
---
" You have read more than I
---
" How came you?"


---
it was by accident
---
My life has been

---
entirely shaped by what people call a peculiarity in me. 
---
if you never say it, or
---
However, to say is."


---
" Is your friendship broken off?"


---
my saying
---
We shared a sitting- room for fifteen months; and
---
That's!"


---
" Good heavens!--what did you do then?"


---
" Ah-- now you are angry with me!"
---
who was also in London, and

---
as my father-- had started as an art metal- worker near Long- Acre-- wouldn't have me
 back
---
you did n't know
---
However you have lived,
---
you are
 as innocent as you are unconventional
---
as you see
---
if that's
---
what you mean
---
as they
 began
---
People say. 
---
I said how bad I was!"

 Some of the most passionately erotic poets have been."


---
" Are n't you REALLY dear Jude. 
---
that it hardly seemed
---
" You do n't care MORE! 
---
There was another long silence. 
---
, you
 know
---
And what do you think? 
---
if you
 were n't here
---
you
 would n't like--"


---
you would n't join
---
You must
 remember."


---
you said?
---
" Then you haven't given up the idea?--I thought."


---
that perhaps you had
 by this time
---
that you felt as I do
 about that,
---
as you were
---
And Mr. Phillotson--"

" I have no respect for Christminster
---
" My
 friend took that out of me. 
---
And intellect at Christminster
 is new wine in old bottles. 
---
The mediævalism of Christminster must
 go,. 
---
Christminster itself will have
---
To
 be sure, at times one could n't help; but!'"...


"
---
as preserved by a section of the
 thinkers there in touching and simple sincerity
---
Sue, you are not a good friend of mine to talk like that!"


---
The emotional throat- note had come back,
 and
---
Christminster has much that is glorious
---
" It is an ignorant place, except as to the townspeople, artizans,
 drunkards, and paupers
---
" THEY see life; but. 
---
as it is, of course
---
few of the people
 in the colleges do
---
You prove it in your own person. 
---
But you were elbowed off the pavement
 by the millionaires' sons."


---
" At present
 intellect in Christminster is pushing one way, and religion the
 other; and
---
so they stand stock- still, like two rams butting each
 other."


---
" What would Mr. Phillotson--"

" It is a place full of fetishists and ghost- seers!"


---
Well, that's
---
" But you are good and dear!
---
You are in the Tractarian stage just now
---
", are you not?"
---
me see--
---
" There's a sarcasm in that which is rather unpleasant to me, Sue.

---
Now will you do? 
---
Now will you concentrate your
 attention on any book of these you like, and? 
---
You are sure you wo n't join me?"


---
" Very well-- I'll do, and
---
just as you bid me
---
me make you a NEW New Testament,
---
How was that made?"


---
it was an excellent idea
---
that reading it
 afterwards made it twice as interesting as before, and twice as
 understandable
---
And what a literary enormity this is. 
---
" the synopsis at the head
 of each chapter, explaining away the real nature of that rhapsody.

---
You need n't be alarmed: nobody claims inspiration for the chapter
 headings. 
---
Indeed, many divines. 
---
It seems
 the drollest thing to think of the four- and- twenty elders, or
 bishops, or whatever number they were, sitting with long faces and
 writing down such stuff."


---
You are quite Voltairean
---
nobody is ever
 on my side!"


---
" Yes you are!
---
, yes you are
---
" You are on the side of the people
 in the training- school--
---
at least you seem! 
---
is,:'_
---
that to explain such verses as this:'?' by the note
---
it be
---
You make such a personal matter of
 everything! 
---
You know
---
" But you are!" 
---
Then their eyes met, and
---
they
 shook hands like cronies in a tavern, and
---
you wanted
---
But you take so much tradition on trust."


---
one must take some things on trust
---
Life
 is n't long enough to work out everything in Euclid problems. 
---
before
 you believe it
---
" Well, perhaps you might take something worse."


---
because we are going
---
, are n't we, and
---
Because you are!"


---
Was it that which had broken the heart of the poor
 leader- writer; and
---
They sat on, and
---
" The
 town is not yet astir."


---
" But you have had no breakfast."


---
Things seem so different in the cold light of morning,
---
do n't
 they? 
---
Oh no, you sha n't.
---
who has asked me
---
till this has blown over
---
off we go
---
You can
 have a regular breakfast when you get there."


---
They went quietly out of the house,. 
---
As they departed along the street
---
They stood rather miserably
 together on the platform; and
---
it was apparent.


---
as the
 train came up
---
" One is a warm one, the other a cold one!"


---
And you must n't!"


---
" You must n't love me. 
---
You are to like me
---
-- that's all!"


---
And then the train moved on, and.




---
is something I said
    to you at parting. 
---
You had been so very good and kind to
    me
---
when you were out of sight
---
it has reproached me
    ever since
---
IF YOU WANT
---
: I do n't
    mind at all; and I'll never say again that you must n't!

   
---
It would be superfluous; and. 
---
none came. 
---
The third morning arrived
---
; the postman did

---
This was Saturday, and
---
that somebody would have

---
when the parish
 was as vacant as a desert
---
, most of the inhabitants having gathered
 inside the church,.


---
whence their voices could occasionally be heard in
 unison
---
" How is this! 
---
You could n't write?"


---
" No-- it was n't that!
---
" Yes-- that was! 
---
They wo n't have me back at the school
---
-- that's. 
---
" Well?"

" They not only wo n't have me, but
---
they gave me a parting piece of
 advice--"

" What?"


---
it is so vulgar and distressing
---
" Is it about us?"


---
" Well-- somebody has sent them baseless reports about us, and
---
they
 say!... 
---
you and I ought
---
like that means
---
It did just OCCUR to me to
 regard you in the way, but
---
they think
---
that the cousinship was merely nominal
---
since we met as
 total strangers
---
But my marrying you, dear Jude--! 
---
you thought of such a thing as marrying
 me till the other evening
---
; to fancy you did love me a
 little. 
---
It
 is all my fault. 
---
Everything is my fault always!"


---
The speech seemed, and
---
they regarded each
 other with a mutual distress.


---
what you felt
 at all
---
Oh, you have been unkind to me
---
-- you have--, and! 
---
Your attitude to me has become known; and
---
naturally they
 think! 
---
we've been doing wrong
---
than you think
---
that our meeting as
 strangers prevented a sense of relationship, and
---
that it was a sort
 of subterfuge to avail myself of it
---
But do n't you think,
?"


---
the only rejoinder might not inconceivably have changed
 its temperature
---
you don't
---
" Of course-- care about me in any particular way," You ought not, and
---
you are right. 
---
You belong to-- Mr.

---
" to come.  You are glad, of course!

---
This will blow over, dear Sue
---
" The training- school
 authorities are not all the world. 
---
You can get."


---
there was no more
 intimate conversation. 
---
Such intercourse
 as that would have.

---
The lesson of renunciation it was necessary and proper.


---
It was so dear of you! 
---
the
 cathedral works.




---
which stood on a hill sixty miles to the
 south- west as the crow flies
---
A glance at the place and its accessories was almost enough to reveal
 that the schoolmaster's plans and dreams so long indulged in had
 been abandoned for some new dream with which neither the Church nor
 literature had much in common. 
---
All the furniture being fixed
---
, the books shelved, and
---
the nails
 driven
---
But it was not the real, or the whole, reason, after all.

---
when it had grown quite
 late
---
as by words a place and person
 given over to study not exactly studying
---
And yet the tale, true
 enough till latterly, was not true now. 
---
was
 not history. 
---
few, very few, as correspondence counts nowadays
---
Each was in its
 envelope. 
---
just as it had arrived, and
---
the handwriting was of the same
 womanly character as the historic notes
---
They were
 straightforward, frank letters,"
---
signed" Sue B--; just such ones as
 would be written during short absences, with no other thought. 
---
forgotten doubtless by
 the writer with the passing of the day of their inditing
---
which it
 would infallibly be
---
Over these phrases the
 school- master pored. 
---
What precise shade of satisfaction was? 
---
which just disclosed
---
The schoolmaster's was an unhealthy- looking, old- fashioned face,
. 
---
A certain
 gentlemanliness had been imparted to it by nature,. 
---
Such silent proceedings as those of this evening were repeated many
 and oft times
---
lest they should read
---
as it might almost have been considered
---
although it was fourteen days old
---
that
 this proved nothing,
---
a natural delicacy being as ample a reason for
 silence as any degree of blameworthiness
---
it was dangerous
---
It was merely. 
---
that
 you have seen my little friend Sue recently
---
It occurred to me. 
---
was,". 
---
You know
---
what they say?--that
---
God forbid!"


---
you understood
---
-- since this painful matter has been opened up
---
But-- what really
 happened?
---
who felt
---
that
 a sharp smart now was better than a long agony of suspense hereafter
---
" Cases arise, and
---
this is one, when even ungenerous questions must be
 put to make false assumptions impossible, and to kill scandal."


---
that the suspicion is an absolutely baseless one
---
It is
---
The schoolmaster rose. 
---
Each of the twain felt; and
---
that the interview
 could not comfortably merge in a friendly discussion of their recent
 experiences, after the manner of friends
---
which the old
 cathedral was undergoing
---
This visit took place about eleven o'clock in the morning; but. 
---
if you ask anything more
---
" It is very odd that--"
---
" That you are often not so nice in your real presence!"


---
as you are in
 your letters
---
" Does it really seem so to you?
---
, that's strange
---
When you are gone away
---
that they were getting
 upon dangerous ground
---
It was now.


---
" It was that which made me
 write and say-- I did n't mind your loving me-- if you wanted to, much!"


---
Yes you have
---
which in a few months had ceased
---
" And you had. 
---
us go in
 here
---
by which they stood
---
The building was the market- house
---
; it was the
 only place available; and
---
they entered,, and
 the stalls and areas empty. 
---
the market being over
---
while they walked up and down over a
 floor littered with rotten cabbage- leaves, and
---
Why did n't you tell me before!"


---
It seemed so cruel."


---
So it was better!"


---
Their old relations of confidence seemed
 suddenly, and
---
the antagonisms of sex to sex were left
 without any counter- poising predilections. 
---
which brought about the
 marriage
---
if you had taken it differently
---
that you might love me, or something of the
 sort!--just out of charity-- and
---
that-- all the time-- oh, it is perfectly
 damnable how things are
---
" You take me wrong, Sue! 
---
you cared for me at all,
 till quite lately
---
it did not matter
---
Do you care for me,
 at all!"


---
Sue?--you know'
---
" You are not the least alike. 
---
to come back-- they always do!"


---
you call saints
---
How will the demi- gods in your Pantheon-- those
 legendary persons-- intercede for you after this?

---
it would have been different, and not
 remarkable,.

---
Your theories are not so advanced as your practice!"


---
" Sue, you are terribly cutting-- a perfect
 Voltaire! 
---
when you like
---
But you must treat me!"


---
as you will
---
" Ah-- you should have told me
---
before you gave
 me that idea that you wanted to be allowed to love me
---
They were quite screened from the market- square without, and
---
It would be
 hypocrisy; and
---
that it would be meant as from my cousin
---
it
 ca n't be in any other way."


---
They moved on a dozen paces, and
---
It
 was and
---
But, after all, it does n't matter. 
---
We should
 have had."


---
you see,
---
even if this had not been in your
 life
---
This is the only obstacle."


---
" You forget, and
---
even if there had been no obstacle
---
" And then we are cousins,
 and
---
it is bad. 
---
for cousins to marry
---
our going on together
---
as we were going, in a sort of
 friendly way
---
, the people round us
---
as is proved by their expelling me from the school. 
---
Their philosophy
 only recognizes relations based on animal desire. 
---
where desire plays, at least, only a secondary
 part
---
The wide field
 of strong attachment, is ignored by them-- the part of-- who is it?--Venus Urania."


---
before they parted
---
" There were several reasons against
 my telling you rashly. 
---
One was
---
what I have said; another, that
 it was always impressed upon me."


---
that I ought that
 I belonged to an odd and peculiar family-- the wrong breed for
 marriage who used?"


---
it always ended badly with us Fawleys
---
" That's strange. 
---
They stood.


---
possessed by the same thought, ugly enough,
---
that a union between them, had such been possible
---
" Oh, but there ca n't be anything in it!"
---
Our family have been unlucky of late years in choosing
 mates
---
"-- that's all."


---
And then they pretended. 
---
that had

---
that all happened
---
that they could still be cousins
 and friends and warm correspondents, and
---
when they met
---
even if they met less frequently than before
---
Their
 parting was in good friendship, and
---
which perhaps
    you will not be surprised to hear
---
though certainly it may
    strike you as being accelerated( as the railway companies
    say of their trains)
---
We had intended,. 
---
as you
    know,
---
because the awkwardness of my
    situation has really come about by my fault in getting
   
---
you are to
---
Everything seemed. 
---
" You do n't know
!"


---
what marriage means
---
Could it be possible? 
---
To be sure, there seemed; but
---
that the best course to prove
---
how unfounded were the
 suspicions of the school authorities
---
the requested good wishes for a
 day or two
---
, will you give me away? 
---
you wo n't think
    it a trouble
---
it seems to me very humiliating that a
    giver- away should be required at all. 
---
as there printed
---
is. 
---
as you have
    no house of your own
---
that,, you do not marry from your school
    friend's, but from mine
---
It would be more proper
---
as you say, the person nearest related to you in
    this part of the world
---
why you sign your letter in such a new and
    terribly formal way
---
it made! 
---
; if in suffering-- ah, that was
 another thing!


---
which would allow of a ten days' stay in the city
 prior to the ceremony,
---
they saw. 
---
; their conversation was
 mechanical,. 
---
which seemed
---
You are' father'
---
", you know. 
---
That's."


---
before the meal was
---
they
 had not put such confidence in their new view of things, and
---
" You have quite made up your mind?"


---
After breakfast they went out on an errand
---
together moved by
---
that it was the last opportunity they would have of indulging
 in unceremonious companionship
---
" That's the church
---
what the spot is like where I am so soon to kneel and do it
---
what marriage means
---
they entered by
 the western door. 
---
The only person inside the gloomy building was
. 
---
you do
---
" They are interesting,. 
---
because they have probably never been done
 before
---
" No doubt you will!"


---
" Was it like this?"


---
when you were married
---
" Ah-- you are vexed!"
---
My curiosity to hunt up a new sensation
 always leads me into these scrapes. 
---
You will
---
, wo n't
 you, Jude?"


---
" Now we'll hurry away, and
---
they came out of the building,. 
---
they
 encountered on entering the main street
---
But the first person was the schoolmaster himself,

---
" We have been doing such a funny thing!"
---
" We've been to the church,. 
---
as it were
---
how they had marched up to the altar
---
Will you both
 come to the shop with me?"


---
shortly after they prepared
 for the ceremony
---
The schoolmaster and Sue were unknown,; and
---
" It looks so odd over a bonnet
---
it stay
---
When they had passed up the church and
---
that the antecedent visit had certainly taken off the edge
 of this performance, but
---
Was it? 
---
that they
 were, instead of more sensitive, as reputed, more callous, and less
 romantic; or
---
were they more heroic
---
as they had
 signed their names and
---
the suspense was over
---
at two o'clock
 they went off. 
---
Could it be
---
" It is my handkerchief. 
---
whether it were.


---
when they were gone
---
The feeling grew and
. 
---
Has anybody been
 for me
---
Nobody had been there.


---
even when the clock had
 struck eleven, and
---
the family had retired
---
as watchers sit on Old- Midsummer eves,
---
one or two of the larger stars
 made themselves visible as faint nebulæ only. 
---
Every desired renewal of an existence is debased by being half alloy.

---
; the sunshine was as drab
 paint, and the blue sky as zinc. 
---
who offered him permanent work of a good class
---
what
 worth there might be in the builder's offer
---
The city of learning wore an estranged look, and
---
as the sun made vivid lights
 and shades of the mullioned architecture of the façades, and
---
the place look more
 beautiful
---
It was
---
Hers was
 now the city phantom,.


---
while those of the intellectual and devotional
 worthies were no longer able to
 assert their presence there
---
who opened the door
---
that the builder had called
---
caused by these scenes
---
They walked along the street.


---
it was too
 stylish a place now
---
The bar had been gutted and
---
,
 mahogany fixtures having taken the place of. 
---
while at the back of the standing- space there were stuffed
 sofa- benches
---
The room was divided into compartments in the approved
 manner,
---
being put to the blush
 by the recognitions of those in the next
---
On the inside of the
 counter two barmaids leant over the white- handled beer- engines,
 and the row of little silvered taps inside, dripping into a pewter
 trough.


---
till the train left
---
At the back of the barmaids rose
 bevel- edged mirrors, with glass shelves running along their front,

---
The moment
 was enlivened by the entrance of some customers into the next
 compartment, and
---
the starting of the mechanical tell- tale of monies
 received,.


---
which emitted a ting- ting every time a coin was put in
---
How can you tell such a tale to me in my
 innocence!"
---
Mr. Cockman, what do you use?" 
---
" Do n't you ask questions, and
---
you wo n't hear lies."


---
which you've been keeping from me for
 the last quarter of an hour
---
There was a slight struggle and titter, and

---
this being
 the case
---
The compartment emptied itself of visitors, and

---
Then their glances met.

---
you were underground years ago
---
that the house will
 afford
---
The fact was.


---
That's a pity
---
", now you could get it for nothing."


---
" How long have you been here?"


---
you know
---
you came to this place!"


---
you were gone to glory, and
---
Nobody was likely to
 know me here,
---
" Why did you return from Australia?"


---
Then you are not a don yet?"


---
True-- you look so." 
---
that on the hand which pulled the engine
---
it might be awkward
---
" I did n't mean on that account-- for as I said I did n't expect you.
 It was for other reasons."


---
" What were they?"


---
Here a chappie with no chin, and a moustache like a lady's eyebrow,
 came and
---
We ca n't talk here
---
" Ca n't you wait till nine? 
---
we'd
 better arrange something
---
as you say
---
, we ca n't talk here.

---
However, there was only one thing now to be done,
 and
---
that was,
---
the law being the law,
 and the woman between whom and himself
---
there was no more unity than
 between east and west,.


---
the conjuncture could not be helped.

---
while the hundred and one strokes were

---
The inn was now and
---
the scene was altogether more brisk and gay. 
---
The
 faces of the barmaidens had risen in colour,
---
; their manners were still more vivacious than
 before--
---
they
 expressed their sentiments and desires less euphemistically,.


---
the customers were fewer at last. 
---
" But you must have something with me first
---
Then you can
 go out and
---
as it is best
---
we should not be seen." 
---
What arrangement do you want
?"


---
if you'd like to
---
Of course,, you can
---
Well, that we'll consider... 
---
until we have come to some
 agreement
---
Now, it is awkward. 
---
our being together here--
---
where you are known,
 and
---
As we are going towards the station
---
we take the nine- forty train to Aldbrickham
---
We shall be
 there in little more than half an hour, and
---
nobody will know us for
 one night, and."


---
we shall be quite free to act as we choose till we
 have made up our minds whether we'll make anything public or not
---
As you like."


---
This is my lodging.

---
Sometimes so
 nobody will think anything of my staying out."


---
they went on to the railway, and.




---
where they entered a third- rate
 inn near the station in time for a late supper
---
IX


 On the morrow between nine and half- past they were journeying back
 to Christminster, the only two occupants of a compartment in a
 third- class railway- carriage. 
---
When they came out of
 the station
---
They walked in silence a little way out of
 the town in the direction of Alfredston. 
---
" This is the very road by which I came into Christminster years ago
 full of plans!"


---
, whatever the road is
---
my time is nearly up,
---
the day to go with you
---
So perhaps we had better
 part here. 
---
since we've
 come to no conclusion at all
---
And as I said, I sha n't ask for
.  I'd sooner not walk up Chief Street with you,."

 But you said?"


---
when we were getting up this morning
---
that
 you had something you wished to tell me before I left
---
But you would n't promise
. 
---
if you promise
---
you to know it
---
what I began" You'll keep it close?"


---
It was stupid,
; but
---
" Why the devil did n't you tell me last, night!"
---
"...  Wo n't you make it up with me, then?"


---
They do n't think much of such as that over there!

---
Lots of'em do it... 
---
if you take it like
---
we lived honourable enough, and
 as respectable as any married couple in the colony! 
---
where you were
---
perhaps it
 would be misplaced
---
What do you wish me?"


---
There was one thing more I wanted to tell you; but
---
we've seen enough of one another for the present
---
you know
---
Thus they parted. 
---
; the lines
 of the buildings being as distinct in the morning air as in an
 architectural drawing
---
They looked away from each other. 
---
as you asked me to
---
there was
 nobody! 
---
they told me
. 
---
as you did not come
 all night
---
when
 you found yourself back in the old city
---
that perhaps,, you were upset at-- at
 thinking I was-- married, and not there as I used to be; and
---
that you
 had nobody to speak to
---
; so you had tried--, and. 
---
as you
 did at that former time
---
when you were disappointed about entering as
 a student
---
that you never would
 again
---
why you had n't come
---
" you did n't come back last
 night and,
---
as you engaged to
---
the sweetest and most disinterested comrade, living largely in vivid imaginings
---
You'll go back with me
---
" There's a train just now. 
---
And so, Sue, you really came
 on my account all this way! 
---
At what an early time you must have
, poor thing!"


---
Sitting up watching alone made me all nerves for you, and

---
when it got light
---
And now you
 wo n't frighten me like this again about your morals for nothing?"


---
till they had entered the train,--it

---
where
 they sat down side by side
---
Sue-- you are married now like me; and
---
, you know,
---
yet we have been in
 such a hurry!"


---
that we have not said a word about it
---
There's no necessity
---
you would n't
---
" It distresses me, rather. 
---
my saying it
---
Where did you
 stay last night?"


---
At an inn," though it would have been
 a relief
---
Their talk proceeded but.

---
awkwardly till they reached Alfredston
---
There remained the five- mile extra journey into the country, which
 it was just as easy to walk as to drive, the greater part of it being
 uphill. 
---
It was now.


---
it would be better
---
Since it turns out
---
" You ought."


---
It is not so many weeks
 and--"

"! 
---
" Well, you have my good wishes now as always, Mrs. Phillotson."


---
You are dear,
 free Sue Bridehead
---
", only you do n't know it! 
---
Wifedom has not yet
 squashed up and.
---
which has no
 further individuality
---
" But it has!"
---
A squalid family lived there
 now. 
---
That to you was."


---
what the school- house at Shaston
 is to me
---
as you are in yours
---
they walked some way
. "
---
-- one never knows
---
which elderly husbands do n't do in general
---
If
 you think
---
, you are wrong."


---
" And you wo n't say things to distress me
---
, will you?
---
They plunged into the concave field on the other side of which. 
---
On ascending to the village and
 approaching the house they found. 
---
Mrs. Edlin standing at the door,
---
if you'll believe me
---
What will come o't
---
They must have looked their amazement,
---
Tis more than flesh and blood can bear,!... 
---
that by a feller that do n't know half as well
 as you do yourself
---
" All our family do-- and nearly all
 everybody else's. 
---
You should have done
---
, you simpleton! 
---
What made'?"


---
" What makes?"


---
You mean!"


---
" Do ye love un?"


---
I should
 have said.  I do n't say so NOW, since you must ha' known
 better than I
---
-- but that's!"


---
you know
---
" Oh no-- it is n't that!"
---
" What is it, then?"


---
" It is!"


---
that is--
---
They went back, and
---
the subject was smoothed over, and
---
that would have come so far
---
if you'd like
---
No, dear-- you are
---
you are in a good mood
---
that treated of the Ascetics of the second century
---
The letter bore a London postmark instead of the
 Christminster one. 
---
which could be easily doubled
---
as they had only parted in a slight tiff
---
that this nearness was a
 distinct reason for not going southward at all
---
Christminster
 was too sad a place to bear,.

---
such as was deliberately sought by the priests and
 virgins of the early Church, who, disdaining an ignominious flight
 from temptation
---
was that in a life of constant internal warfare between flesh and
 spirit
---
the former might not always be victorious.


---
A mile or two from
 Melchester there was a restored village church,. 
---
this means

---
By acquainted with the organist the ultimate result
 was.


---
One evening about Easter the choir met for practice, and
---
a new
 hymn was. 
---
It turned out. 
---
As they all sang it over and over
 again
---
When they had finished
---
The score was in manuscript,."


---
the name of the composer
 being at the head, together with the title of the hymn:" The Foot
 of the Cross
---
" Yes," said the organist. 
---
which accounts for the quality of the piece
---
when the post was vacant
---
I think, and.  The hymn is getting about everywhere this
 Easter."


---
If there were any person in the world to choose as a
 confidant
---
, this composer would be the one,,
 and throbbed, and yearned.


---
it was a red brick building some little way further on
---
Also that the gentleman himself had just passed along the street not
 five minutes before.


---
if this were an expedient
 time to call
---
And we have
---
that you composed
---
Ah well-- other people have said so too. 
---
Yes, there's money in
 it,. 
---
These
 publishing people-- they want the copyright of an obscure composer's
 work,. 
---
such as mine is, for almost less than I should have to pay a
 person for making a fair manuscript copy of the score
---
The one you
 speak of I have lent to various friends about here and Melchester,
 and so it has got to be sung a little. 
---
But music is a poor staff to
 lean on
---
You must go into trade. 
---
if you
 want
---
The wine business is. 
---
This is my forthcoming list-- but
---
-- it is
---
if I could only see about getting it published I have other
 compositions to go with it, too; I wish I could bring them out; for
 I haven't made a five- pound note out of any of them yet. -- I am giving it up entirely.  what I am thinking
 of you can
 take one."


---
They talked a little longer, but constrainedly, for. 
---
when the musician
 found
---
which had

---
a letter arrived that morning
---
that very Sunday, and have dinner with them
 at half- past one
---
But a
 growing impatience of faith,, made. 
---
what had
 happened
---
From whose foundation first such strange reports
      arise,


()
---
as Drayton sang it
---
Vague imaginings of its castle, its three mints, its magnificent
 apsidal abbey, the chief glory of South Wessex, its twelve churches,
 its shrines, chantries, hospitals, its gabled freestone mansions-- all
 now ruthlessly swept away. 
---
The spot was the
 burial- place of a king and a queen, of abbots and abbesses, saints
 and bishops, knights and squires. 
---
The bones of King Edward" the
 Martyr," carefully removed hither for holy preservation, brought
 Shaston a renown which made it the resort of pilgrims from every part
 of Europe, and. 
---
To this fair creation of the great Middle- Age
 the Dissolution was,.
---
as historians tell us, the death- knell
---
With
 the destruction of the enormous abbey the whole place collapsed in a
 general ruin:
---
the Martyr's bones met with the fate of the sacred pile
 that held them, and
---
not a stone is now left.


---
where they lie
---
The natural picturesqueness and singularity of the town still remain;
 but
---
which were noted by many writers
 in ages
---
when scenic beauty is said
---
these qualities, to have been unappreciated, are
 passed over in this, and
---
one of the queerest and quaintest spots in
 England stands virtually unvisited to- day
---
Impossible to a railway,
 it can best be reached on foot, next best by light vehicles; and

---
it is hardly accessible to these but by a sort of isthmus on the
 north- east
---
, that connects it with the high chalk table- land on that
 side.


---
such was, the now world- forgotten Shaston or Palladour.

---
hawkers
 retailing their contents
---
This difficulty in the water supply, together with two other odd
 facts, namely, that the chief graveyard slopes up as steeply as a
 roof behind the church, and that in former times the town passed
 through a curious period of corruption, conventual and domestic,. 
---
the world afforded not elsewhere
---
It was a place
 where the churchyard lay nearer heaven than the church steeple, where
 beer was more plentiful than water, and. 
---
It is also said. 
---
that after the
 Middle Ages the inhabitants were too poor to pay their priests,
 and
---
which they
 bemoaned over their cups in the settles of their inns on Sunday
 afternoons
---
In those days the Shastonians were apparently not
 without a sense of humour.


---
There was another peculiarity-- this a modern one-- which Shaston
 appeared to owe to its site. 
---
It was the resting- place and

---
headquarters of the proprietors of wandering vans, shows,
 shooting- galleries, and other itinerant concerns, whose business
 lay largely at fairs and markets. 
---
As strange wild birds are seen
.


---
they followed thither, so here,
 in this cliff- town,
---
as if surprised by a change in the
 landscape so violent
---
here
 they usually remained all the winter
---
till they turned
---
The hour was too early
---
; the pupils were still in
 school, like a swarm of gnats; and
---
which were extensive and stone- built
---
as such trees will only
 grow on chalk uplands
---
till the children were dismissed
---
till young voices could be heard in the open air, and
---
which the abbess, prioress, subprioress, and fifty nuns had demurely
 paced three centuries earlier
---

A piano stood near--.


---
which had

---
They used."


---
It is odd
---
" Oh, but you ARE one of that sort,!"


---
for you are just like me at
 heart
---
turned round; and by an unpremeditated
 instinct
---
each clasped the other's hand again
---
what we both did that for
---
because we are both alike,
---
" And they rule thoughts... 
---
" Oh, you goose--! 
---
" I went."

 just what I should have done did you?"


---
Because we are not alike
---
" Now we'll have some tea
---
" Shall we have it here instead
 of in my house? 
---
It is no trouble and things
 brought in. 
---
We do n't live at the school, but in that
 ancient dwelling across the way called Old- Grove Place. 
---
you know
---
It is so
 antique and dismal that it depresses me dreadfully. 
---
Such houses are
 very well, but
---
crushed into the earth
 by the weight of so many previous lives there
---
In a new place
 like these schools there is only your own life to support. 
---
, they sat down by the same light,.


---
assisted by the blue rays of a
 spirit- lamp under the brass kettle on the stand
---
This is one of your wedding- presents to me
---
Do you know of any good
 readable edition of the uncanonical books of the New Testament
---
You
 do n't read them in the school
---
Yes, there is one.

---
when my
 former friend was alive
---
" That sounds like what I want." 
---
The Gospel of Nicodemus is very nice
---
when they talked on an indifferent subject
---
Indeed, as now, there was
 ever a second silent conversation passing between their emotions,
 so perfect. 
---
" It is quite like the
 genuine article. 
---
All cut up into verses, too
---
; so that it is like
 one of the other evangelists. 
---
when things are the
 same, yet not the same
---
Are you getting up_
---
" Why do you look at me like that?"
---
" Oh-- why do you want?"


---
You must have learnt a lot of everything from your dear
 dead friend!"


---
We wo n't get on to that now
---
" Will you be carving out
 at that church again next week,?"


---
where you learnt the pretty hymn
---
" That will be very nice. 
---
It is in
 this direction, and
---
" What-- aren't we going, then, any longer,?"


---
as we used
---
you were always going
---
you are a flirt
---
There was a momentary pause,
---
the tragic
 contralto note having come back as of old
---
" It is getting too dark
 to stay together like this, after playing morbid Good Friday tunes
!... 
---
that make
---
one feel
---
what one should n't
---
We must n't sit and. 
---
Yes-- you must go away, for you! 
---
-- Oh, Jude, it WAS
 cruel! 
---
unless
 it were meant
---
in the last
 case they may find
---
that they ca n't give it continuously to the
 chamber- officer appointed by the bishop's licence
---
But you are so straightforward
---
Now you must go.
---
" Are you?"


---
I have said that in mere convention!  Honestly I do n't
 think I am sorry.  It does not matter, either way, sad to say!"


---
As they had overdone the grasp of hands some time sooner
---
When do you leave here
---
that runs
---
The coach to meet it goes
 in three- quarters of an hour or so."


---
" What will you do with yourself for the time?"


---
" It does seem hard of me! 
---
You have thought enough
 of churches without going into one in the dark.
---
, Heaven knows,
---
Where you are
---
It was so kind and tender of you to give up half
 a day's work to come to see me!... 
---
Oh, my poor friend and comrade, you'll suffer yet!"


---
that the high window- sill was between them,
---
that the social moulds civilization fits us into

---
Now you must n't wait
 longer, or
---
you will lose the coach. 
---
You
 must come to the house then."


---
" When shall it be?"


---
the wheels of the
 coach departing
---
the coach had gone
---
It was impossible, and
---
They were entirely
 in darkness. 
---
A glimmering candlelight shone from a front window, the shutters
 being yet unclosed. 
---
the floor
 sinking a couple of steps below the road without,
---
which had become

---
since the house was built
---
The
 mantelpiece was of the same heavy description,. 
---
It was too dark, but
---
there was an
 unmistakable tearfulness about the dark, long- lashed eyes
---
if they doubted their own strength
---
if God disposed not
---
We were
    too free, under the influence of that morbid hymn and the
    twilight. 
---
no more than you can help of

    SUSANNA FLORENCE MARY
---
The disappointment was keen. 
---
You are right. 
---
It is a lesson in
    renunciation.

   
---
which I suppose
---
But other forces and laws than theirs were in
 operation. 
---
if anything serious
 happened:

It was, and

 so it did n't matter

that you was n't here

two or three days earlier they had

The funeral is on Friday afternoon.



---
that the grave was finished, and

---
that seemed. 
---
in which Alfredston stood
---
Two miles behind it a jet of white steam was travelling from the left
 to the right of the picture.


---
at last a small hired vehicle
 pulled up at the bottom of the hill, and
---
a person alighted
---
, the
 conveyance going back, while the passenger began. 
---
that it seemed

---
such as it was not
---
that it would be
 so sad
---
you attend the funeral alone
---
though it wanted some
 time to the burial
---
A pathos so unusually compounded as that which
 attached to this hour was unlikely to repeat itself for years, if
 ever, and. 
---
The sad and simple ceremony was soon over,
---
their progress to the
 church being almost at a trot, the bustling undertaker having a more
 important funeral an hour later, three miles off. 
---
now sat down to tea in the
 familiar house; their lives united at least in this last attention
 to the dead.


---
", you say?"
---
" We are rather a sad family"
---
, do n't you think, Jude?"


---
we made bad husbands and wives
---
Certainly we make unhappy
 ones. 
---
Is it wrong, Jude
---
that they are
 unhappy in their marriage
---
If a marriage ceremony is a religious
 thing
---
, it is possibly wrong; but
---
if it is only a sordid contract,
,
 and the inheritance of land and money by children,--?"


---
that the male parent should be known
---
which it seems
---
why surely a person may say,
---
that it hurts and
---
do you think,
---
where
 one dislikes the other for no definite fault
---
" I have said so, anyhow, to you."

" Yes, I suppose.  If either cares for another person, for instance."

; merely"--her
 voice undulated, and

It would
 be just one of those cases in which my experiences go contrary to my
 dogmas

you are not
 happy

 has only been

" Why do you repeat it?... 
---
You will be staying on here
---
This house is gone now.

---
I am merely putting a case.  You may
 come part of the way."


---
" But stop-- you ca n't go to- night! 
---
That train wo n't take you to
 Shaston. 
---
You must stay and.

Mrs. Edlin has plenty
 of room,?"

" It is horrible!"
---
how we are circumstanced, Sue-- horrible
---
Your part is. 
---
that you
 ought
---
before you had done it
---
what makes
---
you assume all this
---
That's absurd, Sue
---
if it comes to that
---
that
 you should object to such an innocent action
---
that you are
 ridiculously inconsistent
---
Perhaps it was too prudish
---
it was a sort of trick of ours-- too frequent perhaps. 
---
There,
 you may hold it as much.
---
as you like
---
Is that good of me?"


---
" Oh-- of course, if you think it necessary. 
---
" Well-- are you sure you mean it only as my cousin?"


---
" That's news. 
---
How has it come?"


---
you never told me! 
---
" What is it?"
---
what you used
---
if to
 say to me is still true
---
if it were true then
---
Of course it
 is not now! 
---
" Ah-- it is n't true!"
---
You are

---
" teasing me-- that's all--!"


---
because you think
---
it would be my fault, my wickedness
---
Do you think,?"


---
" It depends upon what they feel for each other."


---
as you have been with
 me
---
Perhaps you have seen
---
what it is
---
as they lay upon the cloth, and
---
that made the fragile three- legged table
 quiver
---
" And it
 is said. 
---
But that is much like saying that the amputation of a
 limb is no affliction, since a person gets comfortably accustomed to
 the use of a wooden leg or arm in the course of time!"


---
there was something
 wrong
---
there was
---
" But it is not
---
as you think!--there is nothing wrong except my own
 wickedness
---
you'd call it-- a repugnance on my part, for a
 reason I can not disclose, and
---
what would not be admitted as one by
 the world in general
---
What tortures me so much
---
whose essence is its voluntariness!... 
---
That's... 
---
because you must n't
---
you did
---
It all arose through
 my being married before we met
---
, did n't it? 
---
would n't you,
---
if it had n't been for that?"


---
as it disappeared behind the night shade
---
that all was
 for the best
---
It was the cry of a rabbit caught in a gin. 
---
As was
 the little creature's habit, it did not soon repeat its cry; and
; but.


---
when the trapper would come and

---
If it were a" bad catch" by the hind- leg
---
, the animal would tug
 during the ensuing six hours till the iron teeth of the trap
---
had
 stripped the leg- bone of its flesh,. 
---
when, should a weak- springed
 instrument enable
---
it to escape
---
, it would die in the fields from the
 mortification of the limb
---
If it were a" good catch," namely, by the
 fore- leg, the bone would be broken and the limb nearly torn in two in
 attempts at an impossible escape.


---
Almost half an hour passed, and
---
the rabbit repeated its cry. 
---
The faint click
 of the trap as dragged about by the writhing animal, and
---
it stretched itself out dead.


---
" It is you--"


---
is it not?
---
what it suffered
---
They
 ought
---
, ought they!
---
Did it keep you awake?
---
" How was that?"


---
" Oh, you know-- now! 
---
" That may have BEEN my view; but my
 doctrines and
---
And that's. 
---
the last tie between us, Aunt Drusilla, is
 dead
---
There is a stronger one left!"

---
me help you, even
 if you
---
what you mean
---
what you like
---
you were happy,
---
So few could enter into my feeling
---
-- they would say
'... 
---
It is none of the natural tragedies of love that's
 love's usual tragedy in civilized life, but a tragedy artificially
 manufactured for people who in a natural state would find relief in
 parting!... 
---
It would have been wrong, perhaps,. 
---
for me to tell my
 distress to you,
---
what marriage meant
---
It was idiotic of me
---
-- there is no excuse. 
---
one ought! 
---
what one had done so ignorantly
---
, only they submit
---
When people of a later age
 look back upon the barbarous customs and superstitions of the times

---
that we have the unhappiness to live in
---
, what WILL they say!"


---
" You are very bitter,! 
---
"

" You must go in now!"


---
The morning after,, the neighbours saw
. 
---
An hour passed before

---
An incident had occurred.


---
They had stood, and
---
their tense and
 passionate moods had led to bewildered inquiries of each other on how
 far their intimacy ought to go
---
parting in the silent highway; till they had almost quarrelled, and

---
that the fact of the kiss
 would be nothing
---
: all would depend upon the spirit of it
---
" Will you swear?
---
that
 it will not be in that spirit
---
And then they had turned from each other in
 estrangement, and
---
both had looked round simultaneously.

---
That look behind was fatal to the reserve. 
---
They had quickly run back, and and. 
---
When they parted for good

---
was really the cold truth. 
---
" Is it?"


---
is it the
 artificial system of things
---
, under which the normal sex- impulses are

---
to blame turned into devilish domestic gins and springs
---
who want
---
It was not
---
which was
---
that, in this country of
 true believers, most of them were not saleable at a much higher price
 than waste- paper value, and,
---
They kindled, and
,.


---
till
 they were
---
Ay; a lot gets

---
when you've lived eighty years in one
 house
---
It was nearly one o'clock in the morning before the leaves, covers,
 and
---
binding of Jeremy Taylor, Butler, Doddridge, Paley, Pusey, Newman
 and the rest had gone to ashes, but
---
the night was quiet, and. 
---
that
 before a thing was done
---
it might be right to do
---
that being done

---
it became wrong; or, in other words,.


---
which were right in
 theory
---
that things were wrong in practice
---
It was burning, like a
 lover's--
---
" oh, it was! 
---
whether you think it wrong
---
Oh, did you? 
---
What did you do that for?"


---
it was hardly a novelty
---
They lapsed into silence. 
---
Had this been a case in the court of an
 omniscient judge
---
the curious fact
 had not
 said a word about the kiss.


---
weary with the drudgery of the
 attendance- numbers, it was a quarter to twelve o'clock. 
---
which by day commanded a view of some thirty or forty
 miles over the Vale of Blackmoor, and
---
which now covered
 the far- reaching scene
---
the committee to change
 the school- stationer
---
All the copybooks are sent wrong this time."


---
There was no reply. 
---
And there must be a rearrangement of that ventilator in the
 class- room. 
---
The wind blows down upon my head unmercifully and."


---
As the silence seemed more absolute
---
which extended over the walls
 upstairs and down in the dilapidated" Old- Grove Place
---
" What are you doing down there at midnight--!"


---
there is a larger fire here."


---
the tones were small and confined,
 and
---
Under the
 staircase was a large clothes- closet, without a window
---
; they seemed
. 
---
The door was shut, but
---
there was no lock or other
 fastening. 
---
What are you doing in there
---
as it was so late
---
" But there's no bed
---
, is there? 
---
Why, you'll be
!"


---
if you stay all night
---
There being no bedstead.


---
the closet
 afforded
---
" You ought!
---
" It is not becoming in you! 
---
Oh, will you go away
---
it
 is monstrous
---
that you should feel in this way
---
It is wrong and wicked of
 me
---
But it is not I altogether that am
 to blame!"


---
" Who is then? 
---
because they are so horrid and cruel
---
" Well, it is no use talking like that. 
---
if we do n't mind
---
if either of the parsons in this
 town was
---
There's no
 order or regularity in your sentiments!... 
---
you stifled to- morrow
---
the meal began
 almost in silence,. 
---
the burghers walking past upon the pavement-- or
 rather roadway, pavements being scarce here--
---
which was two or three
 feet above the level of the parlour floor
---
They nodded down to the
 happy couple their morning greetings,.


---
as they went on
---
" would you mind
---
Why, that's.

---
what you were doing
---
What then was the meaning of marrying at all?"


---
" You would n't like me any the better for telling you."


---
You had got my promise a
 long time before that
---
as time went on
---
Then you know, and

---
what scandals were spread
---
you had taken such time
 and trouble; and this frightened
 me and
---
it seemed then. 
---
that the one thing would be
---
what was said,
---
for it was
---
my theoretic
 unconventionality broke down. 
---
If that had not entered into the case

---
it would have been better to have hurt your feelings once for all
 then, than to marry you and hurt them all my life after... 
---
just what I fancied I never did care
 for But I was a coward-- and And you
 were so generous in never giving credit for a moment to the rumour."


---
" But you inquired!"


---
" But you haven't answered me. 
---
Will you let? 
---
me go away
---
how
 irregular it is of me
---
It is irregular
---
Domestic laws should be made. 
---
which should be classified
---
If people are at all
 peculiar in character
---
they have!... 
---
that
 produce comfort in others
---
I know."

" But I do ask it!  Will you let me?"


---
But we married--"

"
---
What is the use of thinking of laws and ordinances
---
if they make you miserable
---
when you know
---
you are committing no sin?
---
" But you are committing a sin in not liking me."


---
it would be--... 
---
that it would be
 so much more than that
---
when one feels
---
There-- I've said it!... 
---
" I DO like you!  But I did n't reflect I do Will you let me, Richard?"


---
" You distress me, Susanna, by such importunity!"


---
" Why ca n't we agree? 
---
We made the compact, and

---
surely we can cancel it-- not legally of course; but
---
we can morally,
 especially as no new interests, in the shape of children, have arisen
. 
---
Then we might be friends, and. 
---
We shall both be
 dead in a few years, and? 
---
then what will it matter to anybody
---
that you
 relieved me from constraint for a little while
---
you think
 me eccentric, or super- sensitive,
---
it does
---
" But-- it hurts ME! 
---
I daresay or something absurd.  Well-- why
 should I suffer for what I was born to be, if it does n't hurt other
 people?"

 And you vowed."


---
" Yes-- that's it! 
---
I am in the wrong.  I always am!  It is as culpable
 to bind yourself to love always as to believe a creed always, and as
 silly as to vow always to like a particular food or drink!"


---
" And do you mean, by living away from me, living by yourself?"


---
if you insisted, yes
---
who lets the world,
---
those are
---
Why ca n't you act upon them?

---
Do you mind
---
what never
 once occurred to me before our marriage
---
-- that you were in love, and

---
" You may go on. 
---
since you have begun
---
I have been reading it up.  I wish to, always."

" What do I care about J. S. Mill!"" I only want!  that I have guessed that I am, But do you
 suppose?"


---
me go and

---
it to appear
---
They proceeded to the schools that morning as usual,. 
---
Your request prevents
---
Was it
---
The child toddled off into the class- room.

---
soon the child returned,
. 
---
These words
 only were pencilled therein:


   
---
God knows.
   
---
My whole thought is. 
---
You would lose everybody's respect
    and and so should I!



---
After an interval a similar part was enacted in the class- room, and

---
an answer came:


   . 
---
that if I had been I should have asked you I do n't
    know what I am doing!  I am sincerely sorry to say that it was seriously made.


 I do n't want But
    I can not agree to such a preposterous notion as your going
    to live with your lover.  I know you mean my good But I do n't want!
    Human development in its richest diversity"( to
    quote your Humboldt)
---
To produce" is to my mind far above respectability.
   
---
No doubt my tastes are low-- in your view-- hopelessly low!
   
---
If you won t
---
, will you grant me this one
    request--?



---
me to live in your house in a separate way
---
what you think
---
But can not you have pity on me? 
---
almost compelled by what I ca n't bear
---
that Eve had not fallen
---
some harmless mode of
    vegetation might have peopled Paradise. 
---
Nearly an hour passed, and
---
you KNOW
---
when they met at meals
---
it was nearly two o'clock.


---
There was a cry from the bed, and a quick movement. 
---
Before the
 schoolmaster had realized
---
which was towards the window
---
This was in a moment. 
---
somewhat
 hidden by the canopy of the bedstead, and
---
that seemed; and. 
---
though not particularly large in
 general they appeared so now
---
-- you are not killed
---
Though it's not for want of
 trying--
---
And something frightened me-- a terrible dream--
---
The actual circumstances seemed and
---
You ought
---
Then no one could intrude even by accident."


---
"-- it wo n't lock. 
---
All the doors are out of order."


---
which seemed
---
No further incident touching the matter between them occurred till
 the following evening,
---
when, immediately school was over
---
till the soil changed from its white dryness to a tough brown clay
---
cloty Stour's a- rolling dark.



---
Against the sky was Shaston, dimly visible


   
---
The new- lit lights from its windows burnt with a steady shine
---
tempered by the thick damp bed of tenacious clay
---
The air down
 here,, was not but
---
as it
 had been above,
---
A boy pupil- teacher opened it, and
---
They had been schoolmates in
 boyhood, and fellow- students at Wintoncester Training College, many
 years before this time.


---
" Glad to see you, Dick! 
---
But you do n't look well! 
---
Gillingham closed the
 cupboard and.


---
Why you haven't been here
---
me see
---
since you were married
---
you know
---
you were out; and
---
upon my word it is such a
 climb after dark
---
Though well- trained and even proficient masters, they occasionally
 used a dialect- word of their boyhood to each other in private.


---
so that you, at least, will understand my
 motives
---
if other people question them anywhen--, indeed

---
as they may
---
But anything is better than the present condition
 of things. 
---
God forbid!"


---
that you should ever have such an experience
 as mine
---
You do n't mean-- anything wrong between you and Mrs.
 Phillotson?"


---
My wretched state is--
---
" And the sad part of it is
---
as you know
---
They seem!

---
It is-- but
---
The climax came last night,! 
---
it was a dream
---
that was
. 
---
this
 being the case
---
But is that essentially right, and proper, and
 honourable, or
---
is it contemptibly? 
---
principles
 take care of themselves
---
who has blindly walked into a
 quagmire cries for help
---
you see
---
" But--, there's the question of neighbours and society--
---
what
 will happen if everybody--"

"
---
what's under my eyes
---
said Gillingham
 gravely. 
---
as you should have entertained such a craze for a
 moment
---
" I am quite amazed,.  You said!"


---
you are
---
you know
---
you are in a position to give an opinion
---
it makes all the difference in the world,. 
---
attended by a cavalier
---
to the best of my
 understanding, it is not an ignoble, merely animal,
---
because it makes
---
me think
---
their
 affection will be enduring
---
when they were together
 there
---
what they said
---
that an extraordinary affinity, or sympathy, entered into
 their attachment, which somehow took away all flavour of grossness
---
as I believe though I think I did not mean to confess to you that in
 the first jealous weeks of my marriage, before I had come to my right
 mind, I hid myself in the school one evening, and I heard.  I am ashamed of it now, though
 I suppose I was only exercising a legal right.  I found from their
 manner.
 Their supreme desire is, and."


---
Shelleyan would be nearer to it. 
---
They remind me of-- what
 are their names-- Laon and Cythna. 
---
if people did
---
as you want
---
" But to do, there'd be a general domestic
 disintegration. 
---
The more I reflect, the more ENTIRELY I am on their side!"

 The family would no longer be the social unit."


---
", you remember.... 
---
" It will upset. 
---
-- what will
 Shaston say!"


---
that it wo n't
---
Now," said Gillingham,"." 
---
us take it quietly, and
---
of which they drank a rummer each
---
you are

---
That's the bitterness of it! 
---
that this consultation, singular as its subject
 was
---
no
 sound was audible but
---
that of the purling tributaries of the Stour" So Gillingham, my friend, you had no stronger arguments
 against it than those!"


---
The next morning came, and
---
You may go--
---
with whom you will
---
Some days passed, and the evening of their last meal together. 
---
which indeed was
---
marked by the pallors of restless days and nights
---
,
 might have been interpreted by a stranger as displeasure.


---
" You had? 
---
You ca n't travel on a mouthful of bread and butter."


---
they discussed.


---
as you know, Sue
---
If you will send me some of the manuscript to copy at any time,

---
as you used
---
we ought
---
if we are
---
you not to give
 me information as to your movements, or even your address
---
Now,
 what money do you want? 
---
You must have some,."


---
you know
---
me have--
---
if you do n't mind
---
You are free, absolutely; and
---
your course is your own."


---
that are my very own
---
you would look into my trunk
---
before it
 is closed
---
you would take three- quarters of the household furniture
---
But the rest you
 are welcome to whenever you like to send for it."


---
" You go by the six- thirty train,
---
do n't you? 
---
It is now a quarter to
 six."


---
" You...  You do n't seem very sorry!"


---
you know
---
But you do seem
 that to me!"


---
then the station omnibus came round. 
---
the omnibus had taken
---
Soon the noise of
 its wheels died away. 
---
nobody hear
---
, you remember
---
I said I would call."

 I am much obliged to you, Gillingham, particularly for coming
 to- night."

" How is Mrs.--"

"
---
Have you had any tea, by the by
---
" No-- yes-- never mind," said Gillingham, preoccupied. 
---
" Gone, you say
?"


---
What they are going
---
Whatever it may be

---
It is a mercy to me. 
---
that you have come
---
Would you help me?"


---
Gillingham assented; and. 
---
the
 schoolmaster opened drawers, and
---
But certain facts stared me in the face, and
---
They went on with the packing silently. 
---
When it was done
---
It is;
---
it could be done with less
    obtrusiveness after dark
---
you are on the Melchester
    platform
---
you will
---
But no hesitation was apparent
 therein.


---
The twenty minutes' journey drew towards its close, and
---
At the moment that the
 train came to a stand- still by the Melchester platform
---
a hand was
 laid on the door and
---
Are n't we going?"


---
" We could n't possibly, do n't you see. 
---
We are known here--
---
and here's your
 ticket for the same place,."


---
as you have only one to here
---
we should have stayed here
---
" It would n't have done at all."


---
" There was n't time for me to write and say the place I had decided
 on. 
---
Aldbrickham is a much bigger town-- sixty or seventy thousand
 inhabitants-- and
---
nobody knows anything about us there."


---
" And you have given up your cathedral work here?"


---
It was rather sudden--.

---
your message coming unexpectedly
---
" The Church is no more to me. 
---
it lie
---
if any such there be
---
My point of bliss is not upward, but here."


---
they had travelled a dozen
 miles
---
me go so generously and unexpectedly
---
" It may not work so well for us.

."


---
" That's rather cruel
---
Such a strange
 thing has happened to me
---
" What have you done?"


---
But nobody knows about it over here, and
---
it will not be a
 difficult proceeding at all
---
" Then you'll be free?"


---
" Where are we booked for?
---
Aldbrickham, as I said.
---
" But it will be very late when we get there?"


---
you might do it
---
which followed
---
" Oh-- there's
---
no harm done
---
Is this a sudden change of mind?"


---
You have no right to ask me such a question; and
---
" My dear one, your happiness is more to me than anything--
---
although we
 seem
---
your will is law to me.

---
as
 you wish
---
" But perhaps
 it is!

---
that you do n't love me--
---
not that you have become conventional
---
it IS that,
 not the other terrible alternative
---
when the crisis comes
---
as well as you that I
 have a perfect right to live with you as you thought-- from this
 moment
---
If there had been a rope- ladder, and
---
, it would have seemed different, and
---
My nature is not so passionate as yours!"


---
if we
 are not lovers
---
But, we are not. 
---
But even love may be cruel at times. 
---
You are

---
it is obvious, palpable, to any unbiased older
 person. 
---
you do n't
---
" But, do you?"


---
It is true--."

" Nor me neither
---
you are
 incapable of real love
---
That's not good and loyal of you
---
But it is a delight in being with you,
 of a supremely delicate kind, and
---
" Of course, if it would make... but
---
you reproach yourself
---
you do
 like me very much, Sue? 
---
you do
---
that you do a quarter, a
 tenth, as much as I do you, and I'll be content!"


---
you kiss me
---
that tells enough."


---
This is a queer elopement
---
Upon my word it
 almost seems so--!"


---
you sitting up there so prim
---
" Now you must n't be angry--
---
" You did kiss me just now; and
---
, you know
---
you
 do it again, just yet--
---
how we are circumstanced
---
to let considering, do n't
 you see!"


---
And
 they sat side by side with joined hands,.


---
" Why not?"

" You can see well enough!"


---
" Very well; there'll be some other one open, no doubt. 
---
" You simply mean."


---
though
 you tortured yourself to death by doing it
---
if you will put it
---
" Well-- brutally!--it was a little like that-- that
 and the scandal together-- and your concealing from me what you ought
 to have told me before!"


---
if
 you will
---
You know,!"


---
you are all the world to me
---
whatever you do
---
you think that
---
they reached the end of their journey
 on the best of terms
---
It was about ten o'clock. 
---
when they arrived at
 Aldbrickham, the county town of North Wessex
---
their now entering it by another door
---
When they
 had engaged their respective rooms they went down to a late supper.

---
, that was n't you by no manner of means-- jest
---
as med
 be with you now
---
Oh do you?
---
you must be mistaken
---
How long ago was it?"


---
They had
 this room."


---
it is not so nice and pleasant
---
as it
 used
---
you seem, dear
---
Why do you change like this?"


---
Because it was cruel!"


---
" Yes-- it is the same!

---
There, now I have said it!"

 I really did n't know it, Sue.  Well-- it is not cruel,-- two relations staying together."


---
since we have

---
as we have
---
" How long ago was it
---
you were here? 
---
when we went back to
 Marygreen together
---
" Yes, you said, but. 
---
you did n't tell me all
---
We did n't make it up
---
You've been false to me
---
" But by your own wish, dear Sue, we are only! 
---
It is so very inconsistent of you"
---
Friends can be jealous!"


---
You concede nothing to me and
---
Oh how can you think so! 
---
And you have taken me
 in,." 
---
even if you did n't intend to
---
Was it this room? 
---
Yes it was--! 
---
it
 was
---
Oh it was treacherous of you! _
---
" Oh do n't you UNDERSTAND my feeling? 
---
do n't you? 
---
Why are you so
 gross? 
---
It was true. 
---
you cared for nobody--
---
" It is true. 
---
Or--"

-- you do n't understand me either--
---
Why
 should you get into such a tantrum about nothing?"


---
If it had n't been
 for that
---
as you proposed
---
; to think"

" Oh, it is of no consequence!"
---
My sense of it
 was,."


---
It is a crime--."


---
as the world treats it, but

---
" There-- now you are yourself again. 
---
Yes, it is a crime--, but. 
---
as you do n't
 hold
---
So you perceive."


---
" And you did n't really know anything of this?"
---
you ought
---
It is more than this earthly wretch hardly flesh at all;!

---
called--, you disembodied creature, you dear, sweet,
 tantalizing phantom--
---
Me
 deserves
---
you spirit
---
them to pass through you as through air
---
as you call it
---
when really strangers was a snare
---
The enmity of our
 parents gave a piquancy to you in my eyes."


---
that was intenser even than
 the novelty of ordinary new acquaintance
---
as if
 they meant me
---
as they
 stood
---
" Do n't you know them?"


---
Do n't you? 
---
These are some of them:


    There was a Being whom my spirit oft
    Met on its visioned wanderings far aloft.

       
---
Oh it is too flattering,! 
---
But say it's me! 
---
it's me
---
It is you, dear; exactly like you!
---
And you shall kiss me just once there-- not very
 long." 
---
" You do care for me very much,?"


---
do n't you, in spite
 of
---
my not-- you know
---
, which
 substitution also passed without remark,
---
When, however, a month had passed, and

---
, curiosity began
---
; till,
 jumping to conclusions, people ventured. 
---
You'll excuse my asking, Phillotson,:
---
since everybody is talking of
 it
---
is this true as to your domestic affairs
---
"-- was on no visit, but a secret elopement with a lover? 
---
" There was no secret about it."


---
" No."

" Then what has happened?"


---
The chairman looked.


---
" is quite true
---
The children observed. 
---
The chairman of
 committee thought the matter over, and. 
---
The meeting lasted a long time, and
---
at the end the
 school- master came home,. 
---
" Well; it is
---
as you said,
---
" They have requested me or,. 
---
as they call it,
---
It is no business of theirs. 
---
It does n't affect me in my
 public capacity at all. 
---
They may expel me."


---
if they like
---
If you make a fuss it will get into the papers, and
---
you'll never get
. 
---
You see
---
, they have and,
---
what
 you did-- and its effects as such upon
 the morals of the town;
---
as done by a teacher of youth
---
to ordinary opinion, your position is
 indefensible. 
---
You must let."


---
me say that
---
Gillingham saw; but
---
the formal letter of
 dismissal arrived
---
, the managers having remained behind. 
---
The latter replied. 
---
that the matter was a
 domestic theory which did not concern them
---
This they over- ruled,
. 
---
that the private eccentricities of a teacher came quite
 within their sphere of control,
---
how an act of natural
 charity could injure morals
---
It has been stated. 
---
that Shaston was the anchorage of a curious and
 interesting group of itinerants, who frequented the numerous fairs
 and markets held up and down Wessex during the summer and autumn
 months
---
The body included two cheap Jacks, a shooting- gallery proprietor
 and the ladies who loaded the guns, a pair of boxing- masters, a
 steam- roundabout manager, two travelling broom- makers, who called
 themselves widows, a gingerbread- stall keeper, a swing- boat owner,
 and a" test- your- strength" man.


---
This generous phalanx of supporters, and a few others of independent
 judgment, whose own domestic experiences had been not without
 vicissitude
---
that
 issue was joined
---
, the result being a general scuffle,
---
wherein a black
 board was split,
---
three panes of the school windows were broken
---
,
 an inkbottle was spilled over a town- councillor's shirt front
---
the blood running down the rector's face
---
Gillingham came and.


---
you are ill
---
When Gillingham reached home
---
, when the sun was going down in
 splendour over the lowlands of Blackmoor, and
---
somebody come to the house,
---
a
 few minutes after there was a tap at the bedroom door
---
; the door was hesitatingly opened, and
---
you were ill-- very ill
---
you had not come
---
It is a little
 too soon
---
-- that's all I mean. 
---
us make the best of it
---
You
 haven't heard about the school?"


---
we are going--
---
that's all
---
They talked on slight and ephemeral subjects, and
---
that a cup was
---
That young person was much more interested in their history
 than they supposed, and. 
---
While they sipped
---
It is such a beautiful sunset,
 Richard
---
" They are mostly beautiful from here,. 
---
as they do n't shine into this
 gloomy corner where I lie
---
" Would n't you like? 
---
It is."


---
like heaven
 opened
---
" No-- the bedstead ca n't be shifted."


---
There-- you can see the great red sun now
---
it will
---
You are an odd creature!
---
The idea of your coming to see me after
 what has passed!"


---
us go back upon that
---
You do n't hate me
---
, do you? 
---
You
 have been such a kind friend to me!"


---
It grew dusk quickly in the gloomy room during their intermittent
 chat, and
---
when candles were brought and
---
it was time to leave
---
It was bad policy
---
you ca n't, you ca n't
---
" You ca n't condone it
 now!"


---
you mean
---
, in effect,, of course?"

" You may assume it
---
" It was a bad marriage."


---
You ca n't have me back now
---
As you are not so ill as I
 thought
---
although, there and back, it was
 a journey of nine miles, which had to be performed between tea and
 supper, after a hard day's work in school
---
Gillingham noticed.


---
since you called last
---
You have made it up?"


---
" What do you say?"


---
" What do you mean?
---
which, singularly enough, I think
---
that fact would afford me opportunity of doing it
---
For-- there's no use in mincing
 words
---
course is... 
---
And for worldly reasons,
 too, it will be better. 
---
what was best for
 us
---
what has
 suggested
---
to say is
.

---
as they ought
---
Gillingham did not hurry. 
---
you are right in your determination
---
if you can carry it
 out
---
if you can

which are

Part Fifth


 AT ALDBRICKHAM AND ELSEWHERE



   " Thy aerial part, and all the fiery parts mingled in thee, though by nature
---
they have an upward
     tendency, still in obedience to the disposition of the
     universe
---
they are here in the compound
     mass the body."--M.  ANTONINUS( Long).



---
How Gillingham's doubts were disposed of
---
will most quickly appear by
 passing over the series of dreary months and incidents that followed
 the events of the last chapter, and coming on to a Sunday in the
 February of the year following.


---
The proceedings in the
 law- courts had reached their consciousness, but as a distant sound
 and an occasional missive which they hardly understood.


---
Well; and what is it about?
---
Both cases had been too
 insignificant to be reported in the papers, further than by name in
 a long list of other undefended cases.


---
Now then, Sue, at any rate, you can do!" 
---
what you like
---
that a clergyman may object
 personally
---
do you think
---
it is really so with us
---
it is
 generally
---
if the truth about us had been known
---
Well--, the decree would n't have

---
It is only,
---
is it,? 
---
because we have made no defence,
 and
---
Therefore is my freedom
 lawful
---
, however proper it may be?"


---
" Well-- why did you let? 
---
it be under false pretences
---
You have only
 yourself to blame
---
You ought. 
---
You must
 take me."


---
Perhaps you were right. 
---
As to your
 question, we were not obliged. 
---
That was their
 business. 
---
Anyhow we are living together."


---
" One thing is certain,. 
---
however the decree may be brought
 about
---
that, a marriage is dissolved
---
when it is dissolved
---
There is this
 advantage in being poor obscure people like us--. 
---
that these things are

---
It was the same with me
 and Arabella. 
---
nobody inquired,
---
nobody suspected it
---
If we'd been patented

---
nobilities we should have had infinite trouble, and
---
days and weeks
 would have been spent in investigations."


---
that they should take a walk in the fields,

---
even if they had
---
" Now we'll strut arm and arm like any other engaged
 couple. 
---
We've a legal right to."


---
They rambled out of the town, and along a path over the low- lying
 lands that bordered it,
---
though these were frosty now, and
---
the
 extensive seed- fields were bare of colour and produce. 
---
The pair,
 however, were so absorbed in their own situation.


---
that their
 surroundings were little in their consciousness
---
" Well, my dearest, the result of all this is."


---
that we can marry after
 a decent interval
---
And are n't we going to?"


---
lest an
 iron contract should extinguish your tenderness for me, and mine for
 you,
---
as it did between our unfortunate parents
---
" Still, what can we do? 
---
as you know
---
as we are living now,
---
" I do n't like; but I feel just the same about
 it now as I have done all along.  I have just the same dread."

 I do love you,, Sue."

" I know it abundantly.  But I think I would much rather go on living
 always as lovers, and only meeting by day.  And henceforward we need n't be so particular."


---
as we have
 been about appearances
---
Our experiences of matrimony with others have not been encouraging,

---
But we
 two--"

" Should be two dissatisfied ones linked together, which would be
 twice as bad as before... 
---
you had contracted
---
to be loved on the premises by

---
as you are, free
---
yet there was
 also.


---
If the
 marriage ceremony consisted in an oath and
---
signed contract between
 the parties to cease loving from that day forward, in consideration
 of personal possession being given, and to avoid each other's society
 as much as possible in public, there would be more loving couples
. 
---
than there are now
---
There'd
 be little cooling then."


---
but admitting this, or something like it, to be true
---
, you are
 not the only one in the world to see it, dear little Sue. 
---
People go
 on marrying,. 
---
because they ca n't resist natural forces
---
although many
 of them may know perfectly well
---
that they are possibly buying a
 month's pleasure with a life's discomfort
---
if they at all resembled
 us in habits of observation
---
But then they went and. 
---
because they had ordinary passions
---
But you, Sue, are such a
 phantasmal, bodiless creature, one who-- if you'll allow me to say
 it-- has so little animal passion in you, that you can act upon reason
 in the matter, when we poor unfortunate wretches of grosser substance
 ca n't.
---
you've owned
---
that it would probably end in
 misery for us
---
as you think
---
than you suppose
---
it is assumed, and the social advantages
 it gains them sometimes-- a dignity and an advantage that I am quite
 willing to do without
---
intimate as they were
---
" And you are so
 reticent. 
---
But the highest form of
 affection is based on full sincerity on both sides. 
---
even if caught by airy affectations of dodging and parrying
---
not
 retained by them. 
---
under which they allow
---
who was regarding the distance
---
" Do n't you? 
---
" Oh, well-- you are not nice-- too sermony. 
---
" No, you are not bad. 
---
You are a dear. 
---
It is no use! 
---
who are good
---
People do n't want scolding... 
---
nobody to defend me
---
But now you, and,
 it is very hard!"


---
It is too
 wicked of you! 
---
Now we wo n't say any more about it,
 and."


---
as we have done
---
during the rest of our
 walk we'll talk of the meadows only, and the floods, and the prospect
 of the farmers this coming year
---
After this the subject of marriage was not mentioned by them for
 several days,
---
as they were with only a landing between
 them
---
it was constantly in their minds. 
---
It was a lower class of handicraft than
. 
---
they required for their dead
---
It was an evening at the end of the month, and
---
Are you depressed, Sue
---
" Somebody has called?"


---
you were not at home, and
---
" Why did you say that, dear? 
---
What made?"


---
you think

---
it was
---
But that was. 
---
it was!
---
,
 could you?"


---
than there came a knock
---
" How do you know?"


---
They listened, and
---
the knocking came again. 
---
No servant was kept in
 the house, and
---
if the summons were
---
Whoever it is
---
The lonely
 street of early retiring workpeople was empty from end.


---
that it was
---
" What do you want, Arabella?
---
" In trouble, are you?"


---
There was a silence. 
---
An inconvenient sympathy seemed. 
---
But are n't you married
---
But it takes time, and
---
" You are not really in want of money, Arabella?
---
"

" Where are you living?"


---
If you could come down and
---
" it ca n't make much difference."


---
" But you can go and! 
---
" Oh, it is only
---
it is,
---
God
 knows, but
---
And you are not either, dear, yet
---
you to be
---
what it
 is
---
It would
 occupy about seven minutes
---
to get there at an ordinary walking pace;
 seven to come back again. 
---
It was twenty- five
 minutes to eleven. 
---
as they
 would reach it before closing time
---
Heaven only knew.


---
It seemed.


---
if the whole time
 had nearly elapsed
---
as when the door was opened again, and
---
you!--how
 good you are!"--she began
---
as it is beginning
---
one ca n't be
 a brute in such circumstances
---
" You MUSTN'T go out! 
---
It is n't right! 
---
How can you forget such
 a thing, my dear, dear one!"


---
What
 those legal fellows have been playing at in London
---
That's! 
---
There's the absurdity!--

---
Well-- you'll come straight back, after a few minutes,
---
wo n't you,
 dear? 
---
for you to talk to long, Jude, and

---
-- that was
---
it was
 so preposterous of me
---
in what new form a
 suppressed vice will break out in me
---
that's best and noblest in me
---
All
 loves you, and
---
that's gross
---
your freedom from
 everything has elevated me, and. 
---
who have condemned me in the past
---
these late weeks!--they'd believe
---
" Yes, you have been good to me, Jude
---
you have, my dear
 protector."


---
if you must
---
, you must!
---
that seemed
---
you are deserting me! 
---
you
 were like this--
---
it
 would be different!"


---
if you were
---
Since you will have it
---
that you would conquer in the long run,
---
never was: it is only bare
 justice. 
---
The next morning it was wet.


---
as this is Saturday

---
the first
 publishing done to- morrow
---
we shall lose a week
---
Banns will do?

---
We shall save a pound or two."


---
" It was
 sheer unkindness in me-- or worse--. 
---
That's some more of my badness
---
Love has its own
 dark morality
---
when rivalry enters in
---
-- at least, mine has, if other
 people's hasn't... 
---
Do you mind? 
---
" Well-- is it necessary? 
---
if you want
---
you can
---
this going
---
other people shun,
---
when you come back
---
You'll come with me?"


---
Times had decidedly changed. 
---
The little bird is caught at
 last
---
that the latter had not yet risen
---
a frowsiness was apparent this morning; and
---
if you got back comfortably last night
---
,
 that's all
---
that you
 might have met with any mishap
---
" Oh-- how stupid this is! 
---
you call yourself
---
you might have,
---
what you mean
---
if you
 come to that
---
Sue coloured roseate, and said,"?"


---
How do you know
---
when you talked to me at the door. 
---
Well, my dear,
 you've been quick about it, and! 
---
In the
 pause there was a knock at the door, and
---
I expect my visit But I do n't want."

 the chambermaid brought in a
 telegram for" Mrs. Cartlett."


---
;" but it is not necessary
---
you should
 feel it
---
This is in answer to one from me." 
---
any more after we are spliced by English law
 than before
---
money matters work better
---
And then, you
 see,, and
---
if you have rows
---
the
 law to protect you, which you ca n't otherwise,
---
do
---
any knowing-- you'll have the sticks
 o' furniture, and
---
as there was a little flaw in the
 first ceremony
---
In my telegram last night which this is an answer
 to
---
if it had n't been
 for you
---
then how different our histories
 might have been from to- day! 
---
as it happens
---
However,, it is. 
---
the business legally done as soon as possible
---
You'll find it an awful bother later on if you do n't.
---
Ah, yes-- you are a oneyer too, like myself
---
Bolted from your first, did n't
 you, like me?"


---
Good morning!--I must go
---
You
 think not. 
---
they
 went along silently together,. 
---
as true comrades oft- times do
---
And yet it is best."


---
has made
. 
---
you put up the banns this
 morning
---
you might
 like, now
---
possessed by your family and mine
---
you really are mine. 
---
" Sue, you seem. 
---
when you are like this
---
you to say at these times
---
that you have

---
whom you met in the Via Sacra
---
They had now reached the house of the parish clerk. 
---
Wait a minute, would you mind?"


---
us think
---
when people were tied up
---
when you must have me with
 you by law
---
that, we shall be so happy
---
as we are now
---
when everything depends upon their
 goodwill
---
they always kick against compulsion. 
---
Do n't you
 dread the attitude that insensibly arises out of legal obligation?

---
Do n't you think?"


---
it is destructive to a passion
---
whose essence is its
 gratuitousness
---
" Upon my word, love, you are beginning! 
---
's go back and
---
" Yes-- so we will!
---
And they turned
 from the clerk's door,:


   ?
   
---
as they
 walked on homeward
---
Can you keep the bee from ranging,
    Or the ring- dove's neck from changing
---
They thought it over, or. 
---
Certainly they
 postponed action, and.

---
three weeks matters remained unadvanced,
 and
---
no banns were announced to the ears of any Aldbrickham
 congregation.


---
Whilst they were postponing and
---
The paper was one that circulated in South
 London only, and
---
Well, it is satisfactory
---
," said Sue complacently. 
---
Though, after
 this, it seems rather low, and
---
It is nicer. 
---
from which useful
    document you will learn
---
So that business is settled right
    and tight at last. 
---
But is that private affair I wanted to speak to you on when I
    came down to Aldbrickham. 
---
you
    know it by word of mouth
---
The fact is,
---
that, never informed you before
---
that is
    easily provable
---
such a thing was going,  and
---
our quarrel had been sharp
---
so my parents took the child,
    and
---
That was. 
---
as they have rather a hard struggle over there,
    and
---
, they do n't see. 
---
why
    they should be encumbered with the child any longer,
---
If anybody
    says
---
What will you do?
---
" It hits me hard!
---
" It MAY be true!

---
if ever we lived
 together again
---
" The poor child seems!" 
---
to be wanted by nobody
---
The beggarly question of
 parentage-- what is it, after all? 
---
What does it matter,? 
---
when you come

---
whether a child is yours by blood or not
---
All the
 little ones of our time are collectively the children of us adults of
 the time, and. 
---
" Yes-- so
 it is, dearest! 
---
And it
 makes it all the better. 
---
what is most pleasing to you
---
the day perish the night in which it was said
---
There is a man child
 conceived!' 
---
That's!"


---
we can afford.

---
Whenever you have it
---
It remains with you
 entirely, dear. 
---
it's done
---
In the down- train that was timed. 
---
, a small, pale child's face could
 be seen in the gloom of a third- class carriage
---
even when a station was reached and
---
On the other seat were two or three passengers,
---
one of them a working
 woman, in which was a tabby kitten.

---
whereupon the kitten would
 put out its head, and
---
" All laughing comes from misapprehension
---
Rightly
 looked at, there is no laughable thing under the sun."


---
Occasionally, at a stoppage, the guard would look into the compartment
 and. 
---
Your box is safe in the
 van." 
---
A ground- swell from ancient
 years of night seemed now and then.


---
what it saw
---
When the other travellers closed their eyes,
---
which they did. 
---
one by
 one-- even the kitten curling itself up in the basket, weary of its
 too circumscribed play--
---
, the child
 reached the London Docks, and the family.


---
late as it was getting
---
who was out,
---
The train reached Aldbrickham, and
---
Why, that's a long way from here
---
"; a'most out in the country; and the
 folks will be gone to bed."


---
" You must have a fly for your box."


---
" Oh well: you'd better leave your box here and. 
---
There's

---
a' bus goes half- way, but
---
you'll have."


---
" Why did n't your friends come?"


---
they did n't know
---
" Who is your friends?"


---
me to say
---
" All, then, is. 
---
as
 you can
---
that nobody followed or
---
The child fell into a steady mechanical creep which had in it an
 impersonal quality-- the movement of the wave, or of the breeze, or
 of the cloud. 
---
It could have been seen. 
---
Children
 begin with detail, and
---
learn up to the general; they begin with the
 contiguous, and. 
---
" Is this?
---
, whose
 supersensitiveness was disturbed,
---
" is true-- true! 
---
" Well: that's one thing in my life."


---
as it should be, at any rate
---
And that's!

---
-- I'll try;
---
We'll educate and.

---
They are making it easier for poor students now,."


---
you
 know
---
Is it you at last
---
Then a yearning look came over the child and
---
which the least wind of emotion from another's heart could make

---
if you wish to
---
What's this round your neck
---
" The key of my box that's at the station."


---
They bustled about and. 
---
Both went and.

"
---
" Was n't it odd!"


---
Well-- it was significant
---
for us to think
 about in that one little hungry heart
---
" There's more than in all the stars of the
 sky...  I suppose,? 
---
dear, we must pluck up courage, and
---
It is no use struggling against the current, and
---
myself getting intertwined with my kind
---
Oh Jude, you'll love
 me dearly,
---
wo n't you, afterwards? 
---
our adding the legal form to
 our marriage

IV


 Their next and second attempt thereat was,
.


---
though it was begun on the morning
---
Him they found.

"
---
they did not see in
 the substantial world
---
" What is
 your name, dear? 
---
Did you tell us?"


---
" Little Father Time is. 
---
what they always called me
---
It is a nickname
---
;
, they say."


---
And you talk so, too
---
" It is strange, Jude,
. 
---
But what were you christened?
---
" Why was that?"


---
" Oh-- your name is not Jude, then?"
---
We'll have
---
Their position lent them shyness, and
---
that a
 marriage at a superintendent registrar's office was more private than
 an ecclesiastical one
---
having an impression, they decided.

---
to give
 notice: they had become such companions.


---
that they could hardly do
 anything of importance except in each other's company
---
by which that very
 volatile essence, their love for each other, was supposed
---
Names and Surnames of the Parties"--(they were
---
in which the Marriage is
---
in which the Parties respectively dwell
---
It spoils the sentiment,
---
does n't it
---
" It seems. 
---
There is a little poetry in a church. 
---
But
 we'll try."


---
" We will. '
---
So said the Jewish
 law- giver.
---
" How you know the Scriptures, Jude! 
---
You really ought. 
---
the Lord's Prayer in
 a loud voice, as the Rubric directed
---
they all sat by the fire till a late
 hour--
---
Father Time included;
---
I can only quote profane writers!"

" Well, I bain't set against marrying," said
 the widow. 
---
Nobody can hope it more, than anybody else now
 living. 
---
For they have been unlucky that way
---
" And I hope'.  what I do
 of your families, which is more, I suppose,, God knows."


---
" They was always good- hearted people, too--
---
if
 they knowed it
---
But things happened
, and
---
if everything was n't vitty
---
they were upset. 
---
No
 doubt that's
---
What was that
---
" Well-- that tale, ye know
---
it medn'
---
where the gibbet is said
---
the child died. 
---
They brought it in
 burglary, and
---
that's. 
---
But it medn't be true
."


---
A small slow voice rose from the shade of the fireside,!" 
---
It came
 from little Time, and
---
they started,.


---
" Oh, it is only a tale
---
they rose
---
The next morning Sue, whose nervousness intensified with the
 hours,.

---
you to kiss me, as a lover, incorporeally
---
It wo n't be ever
 like this any more
---
", will it? 
---
we had n't begun the business
---
we must go on
---
How horrid that story was last night!

---
It spoilt my thoughts of to- day.
---
It makes."


---
me feel
---
as if a tragic doom
 overhung our family,
---
as it did the house of Atreus
---
" Or the house of Jeroboam," said the quondam theologian.


---
And it seems awful temerity in us two to go marrying! 
---
If you are uneasy I am made unhappy
---
you
 would feel quite joyful
---
if you do n't
---
But, you do n't.
---
It is no use
 pretending. 
---
It is a dismal business to you, and
---
that makes it so to
 me!"


---
It is unpleasantly like that other morning
---
"-- that's all
---
us go on now
---
They started arm in arm for the office aforesaid,. 
---
The day was chilly and
 dull, and
---
a clammy fog blew through the town from" Royal- tower'd
 Thame." 
---
On the steps of the office there were the muddy foot- marks
 of people who had entered, and
---
Within the office several persons were gathered, and
---
our couple
 perceived. 
---
that a marriage between a soldier and a young woman was
 just in progress
---
while this was going on
---
The room was a dreary place to two of their temperament,
.

---
though to its usual frequenters it doubtless seemed ordinary enough
---
Law- books in musty calf covered one wall, and
---
elsewhere were
 post- office directories, and other books of reference. 
---
Papers in
 packets tied with red tape were
---
some iron
 safes filled a recess,.


---
while the bare wood floor was, like the
 door- step, stained by previous visitors
---
The soldier was sullen and reluctant: the bride sad and timid
---
Their little business was soon done, and
---
:" See the couple just
 come in
---
That fellow is just out of gaol this morning.

---
They jocosely saluted the outgoing couple, and
---
The latter drew
 back and
---
we had n't come
---
The place gives
 me the horrors
---
: it seems so unnatural as the climax of our love!

---
it had been at church
---
if it had
---
It is not so
 vulgar there!"


---
" How troubled and pale you look!"


---
It must be performed here now
---
No-- we need not marry here or
 anywhere,, even now
---
unless we like
---
We can be married in
 a church,
---
us go out
---
till you are calmer, dear
---
They went out stealthily and guiltily,,,. 
---
as if they had committed a
 misdemeanour
---
who had remained in the entry
---
; that they
 would call in any casual passers as witnesses, if necessary
---
When
 in the street they turned into an unfrequented side alley where they
 walked up and down as they had done long ago in the market- house at
 Melchester.

"
---
Now, darling, what shall we do? 
---
We are making a mess of it
---
, it
 strikes me. 
---
that pleases
---
Still, ANYTHING you will please me."


---
You wanted,
"


---
it to be there
---
did n't you?
---
The place depressed me almost as much as it
 did you--
---
it was ugly. 
---
They walked on vaguely,! 
---
It seems so weak, too,
---
How terrible that
 scene was to me! 
---
This is our parish church,
---
is n't it? 
---
This is? 
---
where
 it would have
---
if we did it in the usual way
---
A service or
 something seems."


---
Why-- it is a wedding here
 too
---
" Everybody seems."


---
it was
---
because Lent was just over,
---
when there
 was always a crowd of marriages
---
us listen
---
how it feels to us
---
"

 They stepped in, and. 
---
The contracting couple appeared and
---
the wedding altogether was of ordinary
 prettiness and interest. 
---
They could see. 
---
the flowers tremble in the
 bride's hand, even at that distance, and
---
past going through the same form
 of self- committal
---
" You see.

---
, they
 are fresh to it, and
---
as we have
---
this has frightened me from a church wedding as much as the
 other did from a registry one
---
We are a weak, tremulous pair,
 Jude, and!"


---
what others may feel confident--
---
Then they tried, and. 
---
they were
 both too thin- skinned--
---
that they ought never to have been born-- much
 less have come together for the most preposterous of all joint
 ventures for THEM-- matrimony
---
that they ought
---
" It is awful
---
if you think and
---
we have found
 ourselves not strong enough for it,
---
since you ask me
---
if you wish, own darling
---
they ought
---
because they were unlike other people
---
We
 are horribly sensitive
---
"; that's really,
 Sue!"
---
than we think
---
The intention of the contract is good, and
 right for many, no doubt; but
---
in our case it may defeat its own ends
."


---
because we are the queer sort of people we are-- folk in whom domestic
 ties of a forced kind snuff out cordiality and spontaneousness
---
that there was not much queer or exceptional in them
---
:
 that all were so
---
" Everybody is getting. 
---
as we do
---
We are
 a little beforehand
---
, that's all. 
---
In fifty, a hundred, years the
 descendants of these two will act and. 
---
They
 will see weltering humanity still more vividly than we do now,,


 and."


---
as


    Shapes like our own selves hideously multiplied
---
Thus they murmured on,? 
---
Well-- the general question is not our business, and
---
why should we
 plague ourselves about it
---
However different our reasons are
---
, we come
 to the same conclusion: that for us particular two, an irrevocable
 oath is risky. 
---
us go home without killing our dream
---
How good you are, my friend
---
: you give way to all my whims!"


---
" They accord very much with my own."


---
while the attention of
 everybody present was taken up in observing the bridal procession
 entering the vestry
---
then they came outside the building. 
---
By the
 door they waited till two or three carriages, which had gone away for
 a while, and
---
" The flowers in the bride's hand are sadly like the garland which
 decked the heifers of sacrifice in old times!"


---
The bride and bridegroom had by this
 time
---
the two moved away with the rest of the idlers.

---
's do it
---
They reached home, and. 
---
passing the window arm in arm saw
---
the widow
 looking out at them
---
when they entered
---
" Well," cried their guest," I
 said to myself when I zeed ye coming so loving up to the door,' They
 made up their minds at last, then!'"


---
They briefly hinted.


---
that they had not
---
" What-- and ha'n't ye really done it? 
---
' spoiled like this by you two
---
if this is
---
what the new notions be

---
Chok' it all, to see a good old saying like' marry in haste and repent
 at leisure-- sakes if tidden-- leading us to! 
---
Nobody thought o' being afeard o' matrimony in my
 time, nor of much else but a cannon- ball or empty cupboard! 
---
it has all gone on right
---
Of course it is only put off
 for reconsideration. 
---
If we are happy
---
as we are
---
that I should
 have lived! ' Tis time I got back again
 to Marygreen when
 I and my poor man were married we thought no more o't than of a game
 o' dibs, what does it matter
 to anybody?"




---
That the twain were happy-- between their times of sadness--. 
---
as it
 had looked,
---
that brought into their lives a new and tender
 interest of an ennobling and unselfish kind
---
one, it rather helped.


---
as they were
---
But the pair tried, for a while at
 least, a too strenuously forward view.


---
There is in Upper Wessex an old town of nine or ten thousand souls
---
;
 the town may be called Stoke- Barehills. 
---
It stands with its gaunt,
 unattractive, ancient church, and its new red brick suburb, amid
 the open, chalk- soiled cornlands, near the middle of an imaginary
 triangle which has for its three corners the towns of Aldbrickham
 and Wintoncester, and the important military station of Quartershot.

---
The great western highway from London passes through it, near a point
 where the road branches into two, merely to unite again some twenty
 miles further westward. 
---
But the question
 is now as dead as the scot- and- lot freeholder, the road waggoner,
 and the mail coachman who disputed it; and probably not a single
 inhabitant of Stoke- Barehills.


---
; for nobody now drives up and
 down the great western highway dally
---
The most familiar object in Stoke- Barehills nowadays is its cemetery,
 standing among some picturesque mediæval ruins beside the railway;
 the modern chapels, modern tombs, and modern shrubs having a look of
 intrusiveness amid the crumbling and ivy- covered decay of the ancient
 walls.


---
which has now been

---
On a certain day, however, in the particular year reached by this narrative-- the month
---
the features
 of the town excite little interest,
---
though many visitors arrive by
 the trains
---
being early June--; some down- trains, in especial, nearly emptying themselves
 here. 
---
It is the week of the Great Wessex Agricultural Show,. 
---
whose
 vast encampment spreads over the open outskirts of the town like
 the tents of an investing army
---
the crowds of arrivals walk through the town in
 a mass, and
---
thereto is lined with shows, stalls, and hawkers on foot, who make
 a market- place of the whole roadway to the show proper
---
before
 they reach the gates of the exhibition
---
lead
 some of the improvident to lighten their pockets appreciably they came expressly.


---
It is the popular day, the shilling day, and of the fast arriving
 excursion trains
---
two from different directions enter the two
 contiguous railway stations at almost the same minute. 
---
which have preceded it
---
One, like
 several, comes from London: the other by a
 cross- line from Aldbrickham; and
---
that made
---
They cast their eyes around. 
---
It is n't so very far to the show- yard. 
---
us walk down
 the street into the place
---
It is years-- never."


---
You ca n't carry home furniture by excursion train
---
; for
 they had.

---
which they had occupied ever
 since the advertisement in those words
---
The configuration of the landlord showed.


---
it sent
---
They sauntered on, but. 
---
They were walking just in front of the inn- keepers.


---
" What's that?
---
" said Cartlett.


---
" Who do you think? 
---
that couple is
---
" No."

" Not from the photos I have showed you?"

" Is it Fawley?"


---
whatever it might have

---
that is told
---
which it was easy to do without notice
 in such a stream of pedestrians
---
They are rather fond of one another and of their child
---
I suppose." ", seemingly,"
 continued the publican.


---
" THEIR child! ' Tisn't their child
---
" They are only lovers, or lately married, and."


---
as anybody can see
---
All continued. 
---
which should combine exercise and amusement with
 instruction, at small expense
---
But they soon
 ceased, and. 
---
which the shyest can scarcely disguise, and

---
as they imagined,
---
which these, among entire strangers took less
 trouble
---
than they might have done
---
That complete mutual understanding, in which every glance
 and movement was as effectual as speech for conveying intelligence
 between them,.


---
that the two ahead began
---
they are not
, or
---
they would n't be so much to one another as that
---
you said
---
"-- that's all,... 
---
As far as they themselves are
 concerned they are the only two in the show. 
---
if you had n't said
 so
---
You never see anything
---
Nevertheless Cartlett's view
 of the lovers' or married pair's conduct was undoubtedly.


---
that of the
 general crowd, whose attention seemed
---
There-- now they are going across
 to the cart- horse sheds. 
---
It is no business of ours. 
---
the show let, as they do in theirs
---
us see it in
 our own way
---
we agree, and
---
Then you
 can look at what you choose to, and
---
Cartlett was not loath to agree to this, and
---
they parted--
---
Anny had burst out in hearty laughter at the mere fact of the chance
 encounter. 
---
my intended
 could n't come up here to- day. 
---
But there's
---
lots of us come by
 excursion,."


---
" Well, they are close by here somewhere. 
---
Yes-- there they are-- by
 that grey horse!"


---
did you say? 
---
You ought."


---
Anny laughed. 
---
" That's you, Arabella! 
---
And perhaps, Abby dear, you do n't know."


---
Ah-- they are making for the art
 department. 
---
we go that way?-- 
---
if all Wessex is n't here
---
There's Dr. Vilbert. 
---
How do you do,
 Physician? 
---
Only two
 and threepence a box--.

---
warranted efficacious by the Government stamp
---
me advise you
---
," you
 have the advantage of me, Mrs.--  Surely not Mrs. Fawley, once Miss
 Donn, of the vicinity of Marygreen?"

" Yes. 
---
you know
---
not as you think
---
" The
 lawyers untied us. 
---
" They SAY."


---
they are cousins
---
" Cousinship is a great convenience to their feelings
---
Shall we look at the pictures, too?"


---
The trio followed across the green and. 
---
Jude and Sue, with
 the child, unaware of the interest they were exciting,. 
---
which they regarded
 with considerable attention for a long while
---
before they went
 on
---
it bore
---
They glanced cursorily at the pictures, and. 
---
When they had stood a little while listening to the
 music of the military performers, Jude, Sue, and
---
the child came up on
 the other side. 
---
but they were
---
as translated
 into emotion by the military band
---
It is not compounded out of my regular
 pharmacopoeia, but
---
such as was

---
A love- philtre, used by the ancients with great effect. 
---
I am sometimes asked for such a thing."  I found it out by study of
 their writings, and."

" What is it made of?".


---
It took nearly a hundred hearts
."


---
" How do you get pigeons enough?"


---
In a few
 hours the birds come to it from all points of the compass-- east,
 west, north, and south-- and.

---
all this is told
 you
---
" To tell a secret, I get a piece of rock- salt, of which pigeons are
 inordinately fond, and place it in a dovecot on my roof.  thus I secure as many as I require because I gather from your questions that you mean to be a
 purchaser You must keep faith with me?"


---
, the price
 asked, and. 
---
you had enough of this business at home
---
" Surely you did n't come fifty miles from your own
 bar? 
---
" Very well-- I do n't mind a bottle--." " I should think!" Dammy, one would think!"


---
you were a young bachelor,
 with nobody after but yourself
---
" But we agreed; and?"


---
it is against the rules
---
" The policeman will be down on us, and
---
Because you have come to the great Wessex Agricultural
 Show-- or?"


---
because WE have come
---
" You are always trying. 
---
me confess to all sorts of
 absurdities
---
that we have

---
what twenty- five centuries have taught
 the race since their time, as one of your Christminster luminaries

---
,, they had utterly
 failed to interest
---
what they were saying and
---
But please do n't mind!--I ca n't help
 it. 
---
The unnoticed lives. 
---
that the pair had hitherto led, from the
 day of the suspended wedding onwards,
---
The society of Spring Street and the
 neighbourhood generally did not understand, and. 
---
The curious facts of a child coming to them
 unexpectedly,," and Sue" Mother," and a hitch
 in a marriage ceremony intended for quietness to be performed at a
 registrar's office, together with rumours of the undefended cases in
 the law- courts,
---
The result was. 
---
shortly after the attempt at the registrar's the
 pair went off-- to London
---
that it was believed-- for several days,
---
When they came back
---
they let and
---
it be

---
with total indifference and weariness
 of mien, that they were legally married at last. 
---
( as it was called) of their going away so secretly
 to do the business
---
But the mistake, kept up much of the mystery of their lives; and

---
they found. 
---
that they made not such advances with their neighbours
---
as
 they had expected
---
A living mystery was not much less
 interesting than a dead scandal.


---
who at first had used
---
when they came,
 in these days
---
the neighbouring artizans' wives looked straight along the
 pavement.


---
Nobody molested them; but
---
, it is true
---
an oppressive atmosphere began
 particularly after their excursion to the
 show,. 
---
as if that visit had brought some evil influence on
 them
---
And their temperaments were precisely of a kind to suffer from
 this atmosphere, and. 
---
Their apparent attempt at reparation had come too
 late to be effective.


---
The headstone and epitaph orders fell off: and
---
when autumn came
---
The life suits us, certainly; but
---
if we could get
 away to a place where we are unknown
---
, we should be. 
---
And you have been keeping on this
 house and furniture entirely for me and the boy! 
---
You do n't want
 it yourself, and
---
the expense is unnecessary. 
---
whatever we do
---
wherever we go
---
We'll get nice lodgings,
. 
---
wherever we go
---
it behoves me
---
you to do that
---
There was a knock at the door, and
---
Biles and Willis, the building
 contractors, sent me."


---
if you'll undertake the relettering
 of the ten commandments in a little church they've been restoring
 lately in the country near here
---
It is not a very artistic job
---
"," continued the messenger. 
---
" The
 clergyman is a very old- fashioned chap, and
---
anything more be done
---
who was over- restoration
---
The Ten Commandments are fixed to the east end
---
"," the messenger went
 on," and
---
they want."


---
them carted off as old materials belonging to the
 contractor in the usual way of the trade
---
A bargain as to terms was struck, and
---
There, you
 see
---
you
 can help in it--
---
at least you can try
---
We shall have all the church
 to ourselves,."


---
as the rest of the work is finished
---
what the contractor's clerk had said
---
that was true
---
The tables of the Jewish law towered sternly over the utensils of
 Christian grace, as the chief ornament of the chancel end, in the
 fine dry style of the last century. 
---
as their framework was

---
they could not be taken down for
 repair. 
---
crumbled by damp,
---
when
 this had been done, and the whole cleansed
---
because they liked
---
Nobody seemed likely to disturb them; and
---
the
 pleasant twitter of birds, and rustle of October leafage, came in
 through an open window, and.


---
They were not, however,.

---
About half- past twelve there came footsteps on the gravel without.

---
They passed on into an aisle,. 
---
at which time the door
 again opened, and-- a small one, that of little
 Time, who was crying
---
another figure entered
---
because they said--
---
The child
 went into the churchyard, and
---
Meanwhile
 the door had opened again, and. 
---
who cleaned the church
---
Next came two ladies, and
---
they
 also moved forward, and
---
They went back to where the others were standing, talking in
 undertones: and
---
one said--
---
Some say
---
Yes: some say.


---
" They've only been married a very few weeks, whether or no."

" A strange pair to be painting the Two Tables! 
---
Biles and
 Willis could think of such a thing as hiring those
---
The churchwarden supposed.


---
that Biles and Willis knew of nothing
 wrong, and
---
then the other,
 explained
---
which followed
---
The probable drift of the subdued conversation was

---
made plain by the churchwarden, in a voice
, but
---
that everybody in the church could hear
---
though obviously suggested
 by the present situation:

"
---
Well, now, it is a curious thing,
---
my grandfather told me a
 strange tale of a most immoral case that happened at the painting of
 the Commandments in a church out by Gaymead-- which is quite within a
 walk of this one. 
---
In them days Commandments were mostly done in gilt
 letters on a black ground, and
---
that's
---
how they were out
---
before the owld church was
---
It must have been somewhere
 about a hundred years ago
---
Commandments wanted
---
that them doing up
---
they had.

---
Now they wished. 
---
the job finished by a particular Sunday
---
the vicar had. 
---
'em
 have plenty of drink during the afternoon
---
As evening drawed on they

---
It got later and
 later, and
---
they got more and more fuddled, till
---
at last they went
. 
---
they tossed off their
 glasses than
---
No sooner had, so the story goes
---
, they fell down senseless, one and
 all. 
---
How long they bode but
---
so they did n't know,
---
when they came
 to themselves
---
there was a terrible thunder- storm a- raging, and

---
they seemed and. 
---
When it got daylight
---
they could see. 
---
that the work was
---
could n't at all mind finishing it themselves
---
They
 went home, and
---
they heard
---
the next thing was. 
---
that a great scandal had
 been caused in the church
---
when the people
 came and
---
service began
---
that Sunday morning, for, all saw
---
I wonder!"

 where I say,
 that the Ten Commandments wez painted
 with the' nots' left out
---
Decent people would n't attend service
 there for a long time, and
---
the Bishop had. 
---
That's the tradition. 
---
You must take it for what it is wo'th, but
---
as I used this case
 to- day has reminded me o't,."


---
The visitors gave one more glance,
---
who had not
 stopped
---
what it is
---
that they, and everybody, should think people wicked

---
because they may have chosen
---
It is really
 these opinions that make the best intentioned people reckless, and
!"


---
It was only a funny story.
---
"

" Ah, but we suggested it! 
---
such a story was certainly not very exhilarating,
 in a serious view of their position
---
that their position this morning had a ludicrous side,
 and
---
It is droll, after all
---
that we two, of all people,
 with our queer history, should happen
---
That's better
---
" Now we are right again,
---
are n't
 we, little girl!"


---
" Oh but it is serious, all the same!
---
" But do you see? 
---
they do n't think
---
we are
 married
---
They WON'T believe it! 
---
It is extraordinary!"


---
whether they think so or not
---
They sat down to lunch-- which they had brought with them not to
 hinder time-- and,. 
---
" Here-- I've just had a complaint about this
---
what was going on
---
somebody else finish this
---
It is
 best,. 
---
Then their eyes met.


---
How could we be so simple as to suppose!
---
we might do this
---
Of course we ought not
---
Well, it ca n't be helped,;
 and." 
---
They sat down passively for a few minutes, and.


---
;-- Agnostics had scarcely
 been heard of at this time--. 
---
their one common wish to enlarge their
 minds
---
It was late. 
---
: all
 the others had come, and
---
Some
 ordinary business was transacted, and
---
it was disclosed. 
---
that the
 number of subscriptions had shown
---
One member-- a really well- meaning and upright man-- began

---
that it behoved
 them
---
if the committee were

---
speaking in enigmas about certain possible causes: to look well into their constitution; for not respected, and had not at least, in their differences, a common
 standard of CONDUCT, they would bring the institution to the ground.

---
Thus the supersensitive couple were
---
And then bills were sent in, and
---
the question arose
---
The day of the sale came on; and
---
It chanced
---
which
 could be emptied of its effects
---
that were not in
 the sale
---
their few trunks,
 baskets, and bundles, and two chairs and a table, the two sat in meditative talk.


---
Footsteps began
---
, some of which were of. 
---
Their door was
 tried once or twice, and, and.


---
They soon found. 
---
to be discussed to an unexpected
 and intolerable extent by the intending bidders
---
It was not till
 now. 
---
that they really discovered
---
what a fools' paradise of supposed
 unrecognition they had been living in of late
---
with eyes on each other they heard these
 passing remarks-- the quaint and mysterious personality of Father
 Time being a subject which formed a large ingredient in the hints and
 innuendoes. 
---
At length the auction began in the room below,.


---
whence
 they could hear
---
each familiar article knocked down, the highly prized
 ones cheaply, the unconsidered at an unexpected price
---
People do n't understand us
---
" I am glad we have
 decided to go."

" The question is, where to?"

" It ought to be to London. 
---
There one can live."


---
as one chooses
---
I know it well.  We should be unhappy there."


---
" Why?"

" Ca n't you think?"


---
" That's the chief reason."


---
lest there should be
 some more of our late experience. 
---
" You ought. 
---
Gothic is barbaric art, after
 all. 
---
Pugin was wrong, and
---
Wren was right. 
---
in which we looked
 in each other's faces
---
, remembered by dim
 tradition only
---
Yes-- you have
---
what you have said
 before
---
But one can work, and. 
---
what one does
---
we could both follow an occupation in which personal
 circumstances do n't count
---
as you are for ecclesiastical art
---
You
 must fall back upon railway stations, bridges, theatres, music- halls,
 hotels-- everything that has no connection with conduct."


---
you know
---
But even a baker
 must be conventional,."


---
where people are gloriously indifferent to everything except the
 quality of the goods
---
Their thoughts were diverted by the voice of the auctioneer
---
That was my great- grandfather's
---
we could have

---
One by one the articles went, and
---
the afternoon passed away. 
---
after the
 conversation they had heard
---
they were shy of going out while the
 purchasers were in their line of retreat. 
---
However, the later lots
 drew on, and
---
it became necessary,.


---
The impending sale of these birds had been the most trying suspense
 of the whole afternoon. 
---
when it was found

---
that they could not possibly be kept
---
, more sadness was caused than by
 parting from all the furniture. 
---
at which they were
---
The purchaser was a neighbouring poulterer, and
---
they
 were unquestionably doomed.


---
it was time
 to go and see if the lodgings were ready
---
the coast being clear,
---
assisted by the growing dusk of
 evening
---
An emotion at sight of them,, caused, and
---
The cover was lifted from within, and
---
the pigeons flew
 away with a clatter that brought the chagrined poulterer cursing and
 swearing to the door.


---
" Do the buyers pay?
---
before they bring away
 the things
---
" It was so foolish of me! 
---
Oh why should Nature's law be mutual
 butchery!"


---
" Is it so, Mother?
---
Well, they must take their chance, now, poor things
---
as the sale- account is wound up
---
As soon, and our bills paid
---
", we go."


---
" Where do we go to?"
---
" We must sail under sealed orders... 
---
, that nobody may trace us
---
We
 must n't go to Alfredston, or to Melchester, or to Shaston, or to
 Christminster. 
---
Apart from those we may go anywhere."


---
" Why must n't we go there, Father?"


---
that has gathered over us
---
' we have

---
Though perhaps
 we have
---
that which was right in our own eyes
---
they had gone
---
nobody knew,. 
---
chiefly because nobody cared

---
Any one sufficiently curious to trace the steps of such
 an obscure pair might have discovered without great trouble.


---
which was not without its
 pleasantness for a time
---
long or briefly, till it was finished; and

---
Two whole years and a half passed thus. 
---
which would not allow
---
who there encountered each other
---
It was the spring fair at Kennetbridge, and,
---
though this ancient
 trade- meeting had much dwindled from its dimensions of former times
---
,
 the long straight street of the borough presented a lively scene
 about midday. 
---
At this hour a light trap, among other vehicles,
 was driven into the town by the north road, and up to the door of
 a temperance inn. 
---
where it is, Anny
---
we'll go
 in and. 
---
and then I'll come back, and; and I begin."

 Though I would sooner have
 You ca n't get much at these
 temperance houses."


---
Now, do n't you give way to gluttonous desires, my child
---
" This is the proper place. 
---
Very well:
 we'll meet in half an hour,?"


---
unless you come with me
---
where
 the site of the new chapel is
---
You can tell me."


---
within which
 were excavations denoting the foundations of a building;
---
one or two large posters announcing
---
It was covered with an immaculate cloth, and

---
How are you, Mrs. Cartlett
---
" What?--you have lost--"

" My poor husband. 
---
But whatever
 profit there is in public- house keeping... 
---
that brew the
 liquors, and
---
that retail'em
---
You do n't know me
---
," replied Father Time, who had learned to use the
 Wessex tongue quite naturally by now.


---
I am a friend."

" Juey," said, I think.
---
there's another train coming in
---
that's all
---
" But how do you come? 
---
I am surprised."

" It is only a temporary occupation-- a fancy of ours."


---
while we are in a
 difficulty
---
And another coming soon, I see."

" Lord-- I mean goodness gracious Some
 folks would be proud enough!"


---
" It is not--! 
---
not as you think
---
that I am ashamed But it seems
 such a terribly tragic thing to bring beings into the world-- so
 presumptuous-- that I question my right to do it sometimes!"


---
But you do n't tell me? 
---
why you do such a
 thing as this
---
to be executed by a fixed day
---
it has been a long, weary time! 
---
" Well, I am respectable too.  Why did you choose?"


---
" That's a pure accident. 
---
We call them Christminster cakes.

---
They are a great success."


---
Why, they are windows and towers, and
 pinnacles! 
---
" I never saw any like'em.  And upon my word they are very nice." 
---
They are reminiscences of the Christminster Colleges.

---
Traceried windows, and cloisters, you see. 
---
Do n't you think? 
---
Come now; you do,!"


---
what it is
---
instead of,
 a nest of commonplace schoolmasters whose characteristic is timid
 obsequiousness to tradition."


---
How odd to hear cakes talk like that
---
" Why do n't you go back to
 school- keeping?"


---
" They wo n't have me."


---
And there is no reason to wish it. 
---
We
 gave up all ambition, and."


---
" Where are you living?"


---
" You need n't throw that in my face!
---
you must have enough
 of your own
---
You should try
---
"," replied the widow, from the serene heights of a
 soul conscious not only of spiritual but of social superiority.

---
, you know, and
---
There's
---
laid this afternoon by a popular London preacher
---
In the afternoon Sue and the other people bustling about Kennetbridge
 fair could hear singing inside the placarded hoarding farther down
 the street. 
---
who peeped through the opening
---
Those saw a crowd of
 persons in broadcloth, with hymn- books in their hands,.
---
which could
 be distinctly heard with the rest,
---
It was two hours later on the same day that Anny and Mrs. Cartlett,
 having had tea at the Temperance Hotel, started on their return
 journey across the high and open country which stretches between
 Kennetbridge and Alfredston. 
---
" I make no boast of my awakening, but I'm not what I was.  After
 Cartlett's death I was passing the chapel in the street next ours,
 and.  I felt a need
 of some sort of support under my loss, and, as' twas righter than
 gin, I took to going there regular, and.
 But I've left London now at present I am living at
 Alfredston, with my friend Anny,.  I'm
 not come here to the fair to- day. I drove over with Anny.  Now I must go back."

" No-- it is something else,"
---
they've begun this afternoon
---
But something has happened. 
---
" Ca n't ye fix your mind upon what was said by the London preacher
 to- day, and?"


---
But my wicked heart will ramble off in spite of myself!"


---
what it is
---
If
 you on'y knew what I do dream
---
' nights quite against my
 wishes, you'd say
---
sometimes o( Anny, too, had grown rather
 serious of late
---
it
 made into a mourning brooch
---
that's said about the comforts of this religion
---
" You must fight valiant against the feeling,.

---
when it afflicts
 volupshious widows
---
that another good thing for it,, is
---
They drove in silence along the straight road. 
---
till they were within
 the horizon of Marygreen, which lay not far to the left of their
 route
---
They came to the junction of the highway and the cross- lane

---
, whose church- tower could be seen athwart the
 hollow. 
---
When they got yet farther on, and
---
where the pig- killing had taken place
---
Feelings are feelings! 
---
You be excited, dear! 
---
Now you come along home quiet, and
. 
---
us talk about un no more
---
We wo n't
 come out this road again, because it
 inflames' ee so. 
---
they crossed the
 ridge- way. 
---
When they began
---
to descend the long, straight hill, they
 saw an elderly man of spare stature
 and thoughtful gait. 
---
The remainder of the journey was down- hill, and
---
The wayfarer faced round and. 
---
when you used
---
because we had only a mistress down at our
 place, and
---
you taught better
---
But you would n't remember me."


---
You know
---
as you did yours
---
all went pretty straight. 
---
But you-- you were decidedly wrong!"


---
" You are keeping the school there again, just as formerly?"


---
It was
 a last resource-- a small thing to return to after my move upwards,
 and my long indulged hopes-- a returning to zero, with all its
 humiliations. 
---
But it is a refuge. 
---
all other schools were
---
" Right you are. 
---
A contented mind is a continual feast. 
---
you mean?
---
you did yourself by dirting your own nest
---
the harm
 serves you right,."


---
They did not even defend the case!"


---
" That was. 
---
because they did n't care to
---
worried by the information
---
We all do! 
---
Custom does it! 
---
It's all the same
 in the end! 
---
Besides,
 you've got the laws on your side. 
---
Moses knew. 
---
Do n't you call to
 mind?"

"
---
when they read
 it in church
---
we must grin and! 
---
" Cruelty is the law
 pervading all nature and society; and
---
we ca n't get out of it!"


---
if we
 would
---
" Well-- don't you forget."


---
They had now reached the low levels bordering Alfredston, and passing
 through the outskirts
---
; whereupon they drew up, and
---
They followed a lane to a distance of half a
 mile,.


---
Before you are
 upstairs
---
They turned, and. 
---
Into one of these they entered by lifting the latch
 without knocking, and. 
---
What-- you have sold them all
---
when they were left
 alone
---
It is only a little over a dozen miles across the country to
 Alfredston. 
---
" perhaps it is
---
that we have
---
Then Mrs. Edlin can go home
 again-- dear faithful old soul-- the only friend we have in the world!"


---
" Where do you think?" 
---
another had made, and
---
Why should they care? 
---
if they were known
---
It was
 oversensitive of them. 
---
They could go on selling
 cakes there, for that matter,. 
---
Why should you care so much for Christminster?
---
" Christminster cares nothing for you, poor dear!"


---
how it
 scorns our laboured acquisitions,
---
when it should be the first
 to respect them
---
; how it sneers at our false quantities and
 mispronunciations
---
when it should say
---
you want help, my poor
 friend
---
Nevertheless, it is the centre of the universe to me,
 because of my early dream: and. 
---
nothing can alter it
---
Perhaps it will
 soon wake up, and. 
---
It will then be June, and
---
" There are."
                               
---
who decline
---
two, a woman and I,
       And enjoy our death in the darkness here
---
The place seems gay
---
" Why-- it is Remembrance
 Day!--Jude!"


---
-- how sly of you-- you came to- day on purpose
---
we might as well come to- day as on any other
---
it interfere with our business
---
we have a good
 deal to do before we shall be settled here. 
---
The first thing is
 lodgings."


---
, the holiday people all drifting in
 the same direction
---
Reaching the Fourways they were about to turn
 off to where accommodation was likely to be found. 
---
us go and and
---
We can get them
 afterwards."


---
" Ought n't we to get a house over our heads first
---
who had known no college in their youth
---
Crowds of pretty sisters in airy costumes, and meekly
 ignorant parents, were under
 convoy in the same direction by brothers and sons bearing the opinion
 written large on them that no properly qualified human beings had
 lived on earth till they came to grace it here and now.


---
My failure is reflected on me by every one of those young
 fellows
---
A lesson on presumption is awaiting me
 to- day!--Humiliation
---
It would have been better
---
if we
 had gone at once about our own affairs, dear
---
Well-- we are near
---
"; we will see it now
---
They turned in on the left by the church with the Italian porch
---
,
 whose helical columns were heavily draped with creepers, and.


---
for it was from that outlook
---
A passage was
.


---
" Here is the place-- they are just going!"
---
The crowd filled in at their back, and
---
after carriage drew up at the lower door of
 the college
---
solemn stately figures in blood- red robes began to
 alight. 
---
The sky had grown
---
overcast and livid, and thunder rumbled
 now and then.


---
Father Time shuddered. 
---
It do seem like the Judgment Day!
---
While they waited
---
big drops of rain fell on their heads and

---
shoulders, and the delay grew tedious. 
---
They wo n't be long now
---
But the procession did not come forth, and
---
somebody in the crowd, to
 pass the time
---
what was meant by the Latin inscription in its midst
---
who stood near the inquirer
---
they seemed;
---
how the stranger
 should know more about the buildings of their town than they
 themselves did
---
Do n't you mind
,
---
worked in repairing the college masonries; Tinker Taylor was seen. 
---
:" You've honoured us by coming back
 again, my friend!"


---
" An' you do n't seem?"


---
Except found more mouths to fill!" 
---
This came in a new voice, and

---
But Fortune did n't lie that way?
---
" Yer powers was n't
 enough to carry' ee through?"


---
that my failure proved
---
my view to be a
 wrong one, or
---
that my success would have made it a right one
---
; though
 that's-- I mean, not by their
 essential soundness, but by their accidental outcomes
---
how we appraise such attempts nowadays
---
I do n't think I like Christminster! I tried, and I
 failed.  But I do n't admit.  If I had
 ended by becoming like one of these gentlemen in red and black that
 we saw dropping in here by now, everybody would have said:'!' 
---
than I began they say:'!'

"
---
However it was my poverty and not my will. 
---
that consented
---
It takes two or three generations; and
---
perhaps they should be
 called
---
to do to do
 in one; who
 should be as cold- blooded as a fish and as selfish as a pig. 
---
You may
 ridicule me
---
if you knew
---
you would rather pity me
---
if they knew"--he
 nodded towards the college
---
what I tried You may
 ridicule me-- I am quite willing that you should-- I am a fit subject,
 no doubt.  But I think what I have gone through these
 last few years.  And at which the dons were."


---
severally
 arriving--"it is just possible they would do the same
---
worn- out, it is true
---
" You were n't that. 
---
You struggled nobly, and
---
only the meanest souls in the world would
 blame you!"


---
they dropped
 away one by one; and
---
since you wanted
---
There, gentlemen, to
 know, I have told you. 
---
Much good may it do you!

---
there is something wrong
 somewhere in our social formulas
---
what it is
---
if, indeed, they ever
 discover it-- at least in our time. '
---
who knoweth
---
" Hear, hear," said the populace.


---
" Well preached!" said Tinker Taylor. 
---
" Why, one of them jobbing pa'sons swarming about here
---
our head reverends
---
when want a holiday
---
,
 would n't ha' discoursed such doctrine for less than a guinea down
---
'em would
---
it wrote down for' n.  And this only a working- man
---
whose
 horse failed. 
---
who jumped out and
---
The driver, alighting,
 began.


---
If that can be done
---
what shall we say as to
 how far we've got
---
" Order!" said one of the policemen, who had been engaged with a
 comrade in opening the large doors opposite the college. 
---
while the procession passes
---
The rain came on
 more heavily, and
---
who had umbrellas
---
all opened them. 
---
us go on, dear
---
" We haven't any lodgings yet,. 
---
all our things are at the
 station; and
---
you are by no means well yet
---
" They are coming now. 
---
A peal of six bells struck out
---
, human faces began, and
---
As they went
---
their names were called by knowing informants, and
---
when
 they reached the old round theatre of Wren
---
a cheer rose high.


---
's go that way
---
though it now rained steadily

---
"; the windows
 are open."


---
But what
 made? 
---
you tremble so when we were at the barrier
---
And how pale you
 are, Sue!"


---
you speaking to the crowd
---
it is all right
 with our plans
---
It comes over me at times like a
 sort of creeping paralysis, and!"


---
" You are getting tired, Sue. 
---
Yes, we'll go
 on at once."


---
They started in quest of the lodging, and
---
that seemed
---
it was not so fascinating-- a narrow lane
 close to the back of a college,
---
The little houses were darkened to gloom by the high collegiate
 buildings, within which life was so far removed from that of the
 people in the lane
---
as if it had been on opposite sides of the globe
---
;
 yet only a thickness of wall divided them. 
---
Two or three of the
 houses had notices of rooms, and
---
" Why the bells-- what church can that be? 
---
The tones are familiar."


---
Another peal of bells had begun.


---
" said the landlady tartly. 
---
" Did you knock?"


---
We haven't any
 to let
---
me try
---
You do n't know the way."


---
They found a second place hard by; but
---
we do n't let"; and
---
where there are children
---
The small child squared its mouth and. 
---
that trouble loomed
---
" Are the great old houses gaols?"


---
which perhaps you'll study in some day
---
" Now we'll try again
---
Leaving Kennetbridge for this place is like coming from
 Caiaphas to Pilate!... 
---
Nobody would notice it now
---
There was one other house, and
---
they tried a third time. 
---
they perforce adopted
---
But they
 could not afford; and
---
that the window
 commanded the back of another of the colleges
---
the landlady came up, and
.

---
lest the conditions of the contract should kill their love, yet

---
wishing to be together, they had literally not found the courage
 to repeat it,.

---
though they had attempted it two or three times
---
The housewife looked embarrassed, and. 
---
The hall and stairs fresh painted,! 
---
to be kicked about by
 them
---
You must have known. 
---
all was not straight with' em--
---
as it seemed
---
you have
 the room for the week after all
---
as
 it is getting late in the afternoon
---
if you can
 leave early in the morning
---
When the landlady had

---
that the rain had
 ceased
---
that, after putting the little ones
 to bed, they should go out and and
,
---
as
 they had been that day
---
nobody to promise her a room for the
 following day
---
the house being little
 more than an old intramural cottage, and
---
At some distance opposite, the outer
 walls of Sarcophagus College-- silent, black, and windowless-- threw
 their four centuries of gloom, bigotry, and. 
---
The outlines of Rubric College also were discernible beyond the
 other, and the tower of a third farther off still. 
---
Mother, WHAT shall we do
 to- morrow
---
Then it would n't matter so much! 
---
" It would n't!
---
" No!  All is trouble, adversity, and suffering!"


---
It would be better
---
" to be out o' the world than in it, would n't it?"


---
"

"' Tis because of us children, too, is n't it,?"


---
that you ca n't get a
 good lodging
---
" Well-- people do object to children sometimes."


---
if children make so much trouble
---
" Then, why do people have' em?"


---
because it is a law of nature
---
" But we do n't ask?"


---
what makes it worse with me
---
" And is. 
---
you need n't have had me
---
unless you liked
---
n't to have
 come to' ee-- that's the real truth! 
---
" You could n't help it, my dear."


---
whenever children be born
---
that that are not wanted
---
they
 should be killed directly,
---
before their souls come to'em, and
---
as circumstances permitted
---
There is going
---
" There is going."

" What!" 
---
" Oh God, Mother, you've never
 a- sent for another; and such trouble with what you've got!"


---
" Oh you do n't care
---
, you do n't care!"
---
" How EVER could you, Mother, be so wicked
 and cruel as this,! 
---
when you need n't have done it, and Father well
---
till we was better
 off
---
we turned out to- morrow;
 and... ''
 purpose!--'tis--'tis!" 
---
yet you be going!
---
Tis done o
---
Y- you must forgive me, little Jude!"
---
I will when you are
 older
---
It does seem--
---
, now we are in
 these difficulties! 
---
But it-- is not quite on
 purpose
---
" Yes it is--! 
---
it must be
---
For nobody would interfere with us, like
 that,! 
---
unless you agreed
---
you care for me, or Father, or any of us any more
---
in which
 a bed had been spread on the floor
---
If we
 children was gone there
---
what had happened
---
who,, must be fatigued by their exertions of yesterday
---
Somehow, now it was morning
---
, the request to leave the lodgings
 did not seem such a depressing incident. 
---
as it had seemed the night
 before, nor
---
that it would not be worth
, but
---
You must all come to this inn for a day or two
---
" It is
 a rough place, and
---
it will not be so nice for the children, but
---
we
 shall have more time to look round. 
---
There are plenty of lodgings in
 the suburbs-- in my old quarter of Beersheba. 
---
now you are here, my bird
---
You are sure you are well? 
---
There will
 be plenty of time. 
---
before
 they wake
---
in a quarter of an hour they
 started together,. 
---
that all was quiet in the children's room, and
---
This was perfunctorily done, and

---
it being now about half- past
 eight o'clock
---
which had seemed
---
that the door of the room, or rather
 closet-- to go heavily upon its hinges-- was open, and
---
spread on the boards; no children were there. 
---
Half- paralyzed by the strange and consummate horror of the scene
---
the feel of their bodies in the momentary
 handling seemed. 
---
that they were dead
---
The nearest surgeon came in, but,
---
The children were past
 saving, for. 
---
though their bodies were still barely cold it was
 conjectured that they had been hanging more than an hour
---
held by the parents later on,
---
when they were able to
 reason on the case
---
The
 probability, was
---
Moreover a
 piece of paper was found upon the floor,.
---
because we are too menny
---
which knew no
 abatement
---
They could hear from this chamber, and

---
the people moving about above
---
if there were any hope
---
there was no hope
---
The Doctor says
. 
---
They seem
. 
---
before they are old enough to have staying
 power to resist them
---
it is the beginning of the coming
 universal wish not to live
---
When
 everybody was gone
---
When the house was silent, and
---
they could do nothing but
---
await the
 coroner's inquest, a subdued, large, low voice spread into the air of
 the room from behind the heavy walls at the back.


---
" What is it?
---
It's the anthem from the seventy- third Psalm
---
;' Truly God is.'
---
They had done no harm! 
---
Why
 should they have been taken away, and not I!"


---
There was another stillness-- broken at last by two persons in
 conversation somewhere without.


---
They are talking about us, no doubt!"
---
" They
 are two clergymen of different views,. 
---
" There is something external to us!' 
---
which says,'
---
You
 sha n't
---
First it said,'!' 
---
You sha n't learn
---
Then it said,'!' 
---
You
 sha n't labour
---
Now it says,'!'"


---
You sha n't love
---
That's bitter of you, darling
---
" But it's true!"


---
Thus they waited, and
---
them lie
---
" Why do n't you speak to me, Jude?
---
Oh, my comrade, our perfect union-- our two- in- oneness-- is
!"


---
Shadowed by death
---
"-- that's all."


---
" Ah; but it was I! 
---
the world was against us,; and
---
that it was better to
 be out of life than in it at this price
---
" Why did you do it, Sue?"


---
It was. 
---
Your plan might have been a good one for the majority of cases
---
"; only
 in our peculiar case it chanced. 
---
my baby darling a new frock
---
My eyes are
 so swollen that I can scarcely see; and
---
We went about loving each other too
 much--! 
---
We
 said--. 
---
do you remember?--that
---
we would make a virtue of joy
---
it was Nature's intention,
---
that we
 should be joyful in what instincts
---
" It is best,
 perhaps,
---
that they should be gone.--Yes
---
it is
---
that
 they should be plucked fresh!
---
Some say."


---
that the elders should rejoice
---
when
 their children die in infancy
---
" But they do n't know!... 
---
Oh my babies, my babies, could you be
 alive now! 
---
You may say. 
---
It was not unreasonable
---
What ought?"

---
Nothing can be done
---
" Things are, and."


---
as they are
---
Who said that?
---
" It comes in the chorus of the_
---
It has been in my mind
 continually."


---
since this happened
---
" My poor Jude-- how you've missed everything!--you more than I, for
 I did get you! 
---
you should know that by your unassisted
 reading,
---
The jury duly came and
---
, the inquest was held; and
. 
---
Accounts in
 the newspapers had brought to the spot curious idlers, who stood
 apparently counting the window- panes and the stones of the walls.

---
Doubt of the real relations of the couple added zest to their
 curiosity. 
---
the
 coffins were quietly carried out of the house
---
they agreed.


---
if any
 objection to it arose from the tragedy which had occurred there
---
that they
 would try
---
its number changed
---
where the
 interments had recently taken place
---
who had followed to
 the spot by reason of the tragedy
---
The idlers were all gone now. 
---
whose coloured
 clothing,, suggested to the eye
---
a deeper grief than the conventional
 garb of bereavement could express.


---
them be taken away
---
You said! 
---
before they were screwed down
---
then you
 did n't, but
---
perhaps I
 should see them once more; and Oh Jude, you are cruel to me too!"


---
me to dig out the grave again, and
---
that there'll be
 another soon to swage yer grief
---
It would not
 take long! 
---
Jude, if you will let me? 
---
But it could
 do no good, and; and
---
that it
 was imperative
---
they walked along slowly,
 Jude in black crape, she in brown and red clothing. 
---
They were, but
---
that it was
 not practicable, and
---
they entered the now hated
 house
---
the Doctor sent for.


---
that a child had been prematurely

---
that it, like the others, was a corpse
---
They were in other lodgings
 now, in the direction of Beersheba, and not far from the Church of
 Ceremonies-- Saint Silas.


---
They would sit silent, more bodeful of the direct antagonism of
 things than of their insensate and stolid obstructiveness. 
---
, that the world resembled a stanza or melody
 composed in a dream
---
; it was wonderfully excellent to the half- aroused
 intelligence, but hopelessly absurd at the full waking
---
; that the
 First Cause worked automatically like a somnambulist, and not
 reflectively like a sage
---
But affliction makes; and.


---
opposing forces loom
 anthropomorphous
---
" We must conform!"
---
we must submit
---
There is no choice. 
---
We must. 
---
It is no use fighting
 against God!"


---
whoever or whatever our foe
 may be
---
" What shall we do? 
---
You are in work now; but
---
remember, it may
 only be... 
---
because our history and relations are not
---
Possibly, if they knew!"


---
our marriage had not been formalized
---
they
 would turn you out of your job
---
as they did at Aldbrickham
---
Perhaps they would hardly do that. 
---
that we ought
---
as you are able to go
 out
---
" You think?"


---
we ought
---
shunned by the
 virtuous
---
It amazes me!

---
if any other of them are the same purblind, simple creatures as
 I
---
Yes, Sue-- that's. 
---
You were a
 distinct type-- a refined creature, intended by Nature to be left
 intact. 
---
what you are not
---
If anybody is
---
I."

" I supported you in your resolve; and
---
you go
---
As to ourselves, the fact of our not
 having entered into a legal contract
---
We have thereby avoided insulting,."


---
as it were, the solemnity
 of our first marriages
---
Only the thought comes to me."


---
" It is your weakness-- a sick fancy, without reason or meaning!

---
it trouble you
---
As a set- off against such discussions as these there had come
 an improvement in their pecuniary position, which earlier in
 their experience would have made them cheerful. 
---
People seemed, and
---
that we have been selfish,
 careless, even impious
---
, in our courses, you and I.  Our life has been
 a vain attempt at self- delight. 
---
But self- abnegation is the higher
 road. 
---
We should mortify the flesh-- the terrible flesh-- the curse of
 Adam!"

" Sue!"
---
" What has come over you?"


---
" We ought! 
---
what has pleased me
---
something would take the
 evil right out of me, and all my monstrous errors, and all my sinful
 ways
---
Your
 natural instincts are perfectly healthy
---
Why do you
 talk in such a changed way? 
---
We have not been selfish, except when no
 one could profit by our being otherwise. 
---
You used. 
---
that human
 nature was noble and long- suffering, not vile and corrupt, and
---
you spoke truly
---
as I
 have often said at
 last I thought And now you seem!"


---
" You have been fearless, both as a thinker and as a feeler, and
---
you
 deserved more admiration. 
---
that's
 everything! 
---
that's in
 me
---
" It is bereavement that has brought you to this!

---
Such remorse is not for you, my sensitive plant, but for the wicked
 ones of the earth-- who never feel it!"


---
" It is indulgence."

"
---
But is there anything better on earth?"


---
than
 that we should love one another
---
It depends on the sort of love; and yours-- ours--."


---
when do you wish?
---
our marriage to be
 signed in a vestry
---
Several minutes elapsed, and
---
There is a strange, indescribable perfume or atmosphere about you
 to- night, Sue
---
A sort of vegetable scent, to know, yet
 can not remember."


---
" It is incense."


---
You go there!"


---
You see
---
", Jude, it is lonely here in the weekday mornings,, and
---
when you
 are at work
---
as it is so near
---
Only it is odd, for
 you. 
---
They little think!"


---
what sort of chiel is
---
" What do you mean, Jude?"


---
" How can you pain me so, dear Jude, in my trouble! 
---
you
 did n't mean it
---
But you ought."


---
You wo n't be angry
---
,
 will you? 
---
since my babies died
---
But you ARE!"


---
" From your point of view; but--"

" Of course we were afraid of the ceremony, and
---
a good many others
 would have been in our places, with such strong reasons for fears.

---
But experience has proved and
---
how we misjudged ourselves, and overrated
 our infirmities;
---
if you are beginning
---
as you seem
---
you do n't say
---
it shall be

---
What do you mean by what you said?
---
we HAD gone through the ceremony
---
Would you feel
?"


---
that you were then
---
that's perverse
---
" Why so-- in the name of all, my dear?"

"

" Ah-- you hinted that absurd fancy to me before!"


---
" It was only an impression with me then
---
" My good heavens-- how we are changing places!"


---
"

 Some few days later, in the dusk of the summer evening, they were

---
when a knock came to the
 front door of the carpenter's house where they were lodging, and
---
in a
 few moments there was a tap at the door of their room
---
Before they
 could open it
---
the comer did so, and
---
Yet something seemed.


---
The three attempted an awkward conversation about the tragedy, of
 which,
.


---
who, seeming utterly unable to reach the ideal of
 a catastrophic manner, fumbled with iterations
---
As' tis your trade, Jude, you'll be able to put up
 a handsome stone to' em."


---
We all did."


---
that were n't mine
---
" The others I did n't feel so much for,."


---
"," continued Mrs. Cartlett.

---
" Perhaps' twouldn't have happened then! 
---
you
 were
---
all except their
 obvious meaning was, naturally,. 
---
The latter,
, recovered
 herself, and
---
that was
---
There was no answer
---
Well, my time is up. 
---
-- what do you call it-- in the hot weather, and
---
that should accord with the highest respectability
---
There was no answer, and
---
who kept the lodgings
---
the carpenter said. 
---
who conjectured
---
" It is shut."


---
The spot was
, but
---
the door was certainly unfastened
---
The prevalent silence seemed. 
---
which came from the other
 end of the building
---
as large, probably, as the original
 it was designed
---
It seemed
---
to be suspended in the
 air by invisible wires
---
; it was set with large jewels, which faintly
 glimmered in some weak ray caught from outside,. 
---
as the cross swayed
 to and fro in a silent and scarcely perceptible motion
---
what appeared, and

---
Something white disclosed itself
---
What-- do you want with me here, Jude?"
---
" You should n't come! 
---
Why did you intrude
 here?"


---
" How can you ask!".
"
---
Who has a right to come
---
who love you better than my own self-- better--
---
-- than you have loved me
---
What made?"


---
you leave me
---
it!--I have often told
 you so
---
You must take me. 
---
" But they are nothing to us!"


---
" Yes, dear friend, they are. 
---
My
 babies have been taken from me! 
---
" This is terrible!"
---
" It is monstrous
 and unnatural!"


---
for you to be so remorseful
---
when you have done no
 wrong
---
" Ah-- you do n't know my badness!"


---
You make
. 
---
me hate Christianity, or mysticism, or Sacerdotalism, or whatever it
 may be called,
---
if it's that which has caused this deterioration in
 you
---
whose soul shone like
 a diamond
---
That a woman- poet, a woman- seer, a woman-- whom all the wise of the world would have been proud of,
--! 
---
if they could have known you
---
" You are angry, Jude, and unkind to me, and."


---
how things
 are
---
Nothing can
 alter it!"


---
if ever two people were in this
 world
---
Nature's own marriage it is, unquestionably!"


---
Another was made for me there, and."


---
" Sue, Sue-- affliction has brought you to this unreasonable state!

---
you
 suddenly turn to the right- about like this-- for no reason whatever,

---
you have formerly said through sentiment merely
---
You root out of me
---
is your extraordinary blindness now to your old logic. 
---
Is it
 peculiar to you, or
---
How you
 argued! 
---
that marriage was only a clumsy contract-- which it is--
---
how you
 showed all the objections to it-- all the absurdities
---
If two and two
 made four
---
when we were happy together
---
, surely they make four now? 
---
Ah, dear Jude; that's. 
---
You root out of me what little affection and reverence I had left in
 me for the Church as an old acquaintance...  What I ca n't understand
 in you I
 ca n't understand it, I repeat!"

" You say'? 
---
What are they
 regarding
---
Nothing is there.' 
---
But something is."


---
" That is; and not a true parallel! 
---
You threw
 off old husks of prejudices, and and
---
now you go
 back upon yourself. 
---
" Dear friend, my only friend, do n't be hard with me! 
---
They walked along a few more steps and
---
till they were outside the
 building
---
Do n't satirize me: it cuts like a knife!"


---
They went on."
---
till they
 came to a little coffee- house
---
would you mind
---
if, if you really wish? 
---
But do you? 
---
me go to our door
 and
---
" You said!"


---
you would do
---
Perhaps it was wrong of me! 
---
Perhaps as we could n't conscientiously
 marry at first in the old- fashioned way
---
, we ought.

---
Perhaps the world is not illuminated enough for such experiments as
 ours! 
---
as I wished as I have done Who were we,!"


---
we could act as pioneers
---
" I am so glad you see that much, at any rate.  I never deliberately
 meant as I did.  I slipped into my false position through
 jealousy and agitation!"

" But surely through love-- you loved me?"


---
it stop there
---
But I wanted to let, and go on always as mere
 lovers; until--"

" But people in love could n't live for!"


---
We ought and no more."


---
, as you will!
---
" I was the unhappy cause of the change, as I have said
 before!...  Well...  But human nature ca n't help
."


---
" Oh yes-- that's."


---
just what it has
---
if either were
---
to blame it was not you but
---
I."

" No-- it was I. 
---
Mine was not the reciprocal wish till envy
. 
---
you approach me--
---
that it was damnably selfish
---
us say any more about it
---
" I repeat-- I had thought I ought in charity as
 I did my other friend.  But I should n't have given way...  Jude, will you leave me to
 myself now?"


---
But Sue-- my wife, as you are!
---
;" my old
 reproach to you was, after all, a true one. 
---
You have never loved me
 never! 
---
Yours is not a passionate heart
---
-- your
 heart does not burn in a flame! 
---
as I love you-- never-- You are, upon the whole, a sort of
 fay, or sprite-- not a woman!"


---
you to love me
---
how it was--
---
you see
---
But, however fondly
 it ended
---
" At first I did not love you, Jude; that I own.  When I first knew
 you I merely wanted.  I did not exactly flirt with
 you; but when I found I had caught you, I was frightened.  And then-- I do n't
 know I could n't bear and so I got. , it began in the selfish and cruel wish to make your heart
 ache for me without letting mine ache for you."


---
" And now you add to your cruelty by leaving me!"


---
You have been my social
 salvation. 
---
You know. 
---
you know
---
They have been kept entirely at a distance
! 
---
Is n't
 my safety worth a little sacrifice of dogmatic principle? 
---
if you leave me
---
, but you must not, Jude! 
---
You wo n't!

---
, God knows, about you
---
And this one
 is not that, anyhow!"


---
As it has been so many
 times--
---
-- don't tempt me back
 now!"


---
My God, how
 selfish I was! 
---
the veil of our temple be rent in two from this hour
---
bending over the bed- rail wept silently.

---
You do n't see not
 of dislike to you
---
that it is a matter of conscience with me, and
---
-- it breaks my heart
---
-- it will be undoing! 
---
" Oh but you shall kiss me!"
---
they remained in silence!"
---
We'll be dear friends just the same,
 Jude,
---
wo n't we? 
---
And we'll see each other sometimes--, and?"


---
yes!--and forget
 all this
---
as we were long ago
---
as they stood in the rain at Christminster
---
" What are you thinking of?"
---
said Gillingham,. 
---
as they went home
---
you never obtained?
---
" You said nothing."


---
" I did n't wish.  But,, you should have said:'?'"


---
d'ye do
---
But what do you think of this:. 
---
That's a cheap sneer. 
---
However, there was no doubt.


---
that the
 newspaper report was in some way true
---
I ought."

" Their cup of sorrow is now full!"
---
the schoolmaster
 coming to market there every Saturday
---
, it was not wonderful
---
that in
 a few weeks they met again--. 
---
" It is. 
---
And they
 have been stirred up in me too, lately. 
---
How do they bear their terrible affliction?"


---
things were drifting that way from their manner
---
'em hurry up
---
the thing done
 legally
---
, only hers is of a more' sterical sort
 than mine. 
---
Separated, have they!"


---
You see,
---
" Yes, poor little fellow-- born in lawful wedlock, thank God. 
---
we ca n't live in
 such a hum- drum place as this. 
---
They parted. 
---
a few steps, hastened back, and.


---
which could be subverted by feeling in one direction
---
Principles were
 liable to the same catastrophe in another. 
---
which had
 allowed
---
But artifice was necessary
---
And here were the materials
 ready made. 
---
Gillingham replied, naturally, and. 
---
it were best,
---
all would be well, and decent, and in order.

"
---
" Gillingham is so matter of fact. 
---
They are not
 mine; but
---
my feeling is(, on the old lines). 
---
whether is true or no
---
to do this, there had not been much reason for writing to the latter at
 all. 
---
To indulge one's instinctive and uncontrolled sense of justice and
 right, was not
---
It was necessary to act under
---
if you wished
---
crude loving kindness take
 care of itself
---
It was evening
---
Will you come out with me? 
---
that these words came
---
It is dreary
---
for you to be out
---
if you prefer
---
that all initiatory power seemed
,
---
they proceeded through the fog like Acherontic
 shades for a long while, without sound or gesture.


---
How can you go--"


---
That is for form's sake, and. 
---
which does not see things
---
as they are
---
Nothing has changed that."


---
Yes, you are. 
---
You know it. 
---
you
 loved me; and
---
we closed with each other; and.

---
that made the marriage
---
We still love-- you as well as I-- KNOW it, Sue! 
---
Therefore our
 marriage is not cancelled."


---
how you see it
---
as it would
 be called by you
---
if you and I had married
 legally
---
But how, as we were on the point of doing?"


---
that ours was not a marriage
---
But' the world and its ways have a certain worth'( I
 suppose)
---
who is trying
---
The once
 keen vision was dimmed. 
---
It drives me out of my senses. 
---
You know
---
you do n't! 
---
It will be a fanatic
 prostitution--
---
God forgive me, yes--
---
that's!"


---
what it will be
---
It seemed and.


---
that you might
 not consider
---
yourself slighted by hearing of it at second hand
---
you would be so rough with me for doing so
---
if you would
---
you
 wo n't
---
We are."


---
No sooner does one expect!"


---
you to go straight on, as the
 one rational proceeding,
---
than you double round the corner
---
that go
---
you to go to the cemetery with me
---
our farewell be there-- beside
 the graves of those who died to bring home to me the error of my
 views
---
They turned in the direction of the place, and
---
the gate was opened to
 them on application. 
---
They reached it, and.


---
" It is here--
---
Your
 generous devotion to me is unparalleled, Jude! 
---
if you have failed
---
Your worldly failure,
, is to your credit rather than to your blame.

---
that the best and greatest among mankind are those who do
 themselves no worldly good
---
" In that chapter we are at one, ever beloved darling, and on it we'll
 part friends. 
---
Its verses will stand fast when all the rest
---
that you
 call
---
religion has passed away!"


---
The next afternoon the familiar Christminster fog still hung over all
 things. 
---
It was Friday evening, which had been chosen because the schoolmaster
 was disengaged at four o'clock that day till the Monday morning
 following. 
---
though it had been spoken advisedly
 without fervour
---
" My children-- are dead-- and
---
it is right! 
---
that they should be
---
They were sin- begotten. 
---
They were sacrificed! 
---
Their death was the first stage of my purification.

---
That's!... 
---
why they have not died in vain
---
You will take me back?"


---
" You still
 have an aversion to me!"


---
When are
 we going?  Soon?
---
if you really wish
---
you are come
---
it will bring our lives to
 a triumphant and satisfactory issue
---
But-- are you sure of yourself?

---
It is not too late to refuse now?"


---
if-- you think
---
you ca n't bring
 yourself to it
---
, you know
---
it done quick
---
My strength is tried by the undertaking
---
the vicar half- past eight to- morrow,
 before anybody is about--
---
if that's not too soon for you
---
My friend
 Gillingham is here. 
---
they were in,
---
The flap of the bureau chanced, and
---
It has just come."


---
THAT was put in
---
it to be
---
" But this is the prettiest
---
," said Mrs. Edlin. 
---
" That one is no better
 than very sackcloth o' Scripture!"


---
it to be
---
" But my dear, dear!--whatever...."

" It is adulterous! 
---
It signifies
---
" Yes-- I meant.  what I do n't feel-- I bought it long
 ago--.  It must be destroyed!"


---
You med
---
ha' give it to me!
---
"" said the widow. 
---
" It do make my heart
 ache to see such pretty open- work as that!"


---
a- burned by the flames--
---
not
 that ornamental night- rails can be much use to a' ould' ooman like I.
 My days for
---
such be all past and
---
" It is an accursed thing
---
-- it reminds me of what I want to forget!"

---
" It is only fit for the fire."


---
" Lord, you be too strict! 
---
What do ye use such words for, and! 
---
that's lost to' ee
---
Upon
 my life I do n't call that religion!"

 That
 kills me!" 
---
what-- you ought
---
" I'll tell' ee!"" You are in love wi' t' other still!"


---
If you did n't like
---
you
 med
---
After all, it
 concerned nobody but your own two selves."

"
---
refused, it might not have been so much my duty.

---
Mrs. Edlin
 left the room.


---
who still sat over the supper- table
---
They soon rose, and. 
---
a
 shadow moving now and then across the blind
---
Well: you've all but
---
The pear has dropped
 into your hand."


---
there seems a touch of selfishness in it
---
You might
 have been a school inspector by this time, or a reverend,."


---
Once you've got
---
that had at bottom nothing, but
---
, there was little logic, for one holding
 my views on other subjects."


---
whether it would ever happen

---
it wo n't do
---
" Yes; but you must tighten the reins by degrees only. 
---
The caution was unnecessary,. 
---
what my vicar at Shaston said,
---
you can do
---
The gate of Mrs. Edlin's cottage clicked, and
---
somebody began. 
---
this ought
---
it ca n't be right, and. 
---
you
 ought
---
Of course everybody will say. 
---
It's her wish, and
---
" A great
 piece of laxity will be rectified."


---
if anybody's
---
Now that's all I have to say." 
---
" You've
 turned round, Mrs. Edlin. 
---
It is unseemly of you!"


---
you'd be affronted at what I had to say
---
The truth's the truth."


---
You've been too kind a neighbour
 for that. 
---
what's best for myself and

---
you wo n't go to church with us, then
---
what the times be coming
 to
---
Matrimony have growed. 
---
that one
 really do feel afeard
---
In my time we took it
 more careless; and
---
that we was any the worse for it
---
we kept up all
 the week, and!"


---
"

" Now you've got so far you ought not to back out of it. 
---
That's my
 opinion."


---
; that's true. 
---
" Now, never you have qualms, old boy. 
---
you mean
---
It has always been on
 my conscience."


---
now we've got to this stage
---
you to set the matter right
---
when it gets known
---
Though so elusive, hers is such an honest nature at bottom. 
---
goes for nothing. 
---
The next morning came, and
---
The fog of the previous day or two on the low- lands
 had travelled up here by now, and
---
the trees on the green caught
 armfuls, and. 
---
The bride was
; bonnet and all on. 
---
" Prompt," said the schoolmaster,.

---
Gillingham joined them, and
---
Where is the church
---
since the old church was pulled down, and
---
presently the tower loomed large and
 solemn in the fog
---
The vicar had already crossed to the building,
 and
---
when they entered
---
We almost want candles
---
You do
---
me to be yours, Richard
---
There they stood, five altogether: the parson, the clerk, the couple,
 and Gillingham; and
---
the holy ordinance was resolemnized forthwith.

---
In the nave of the edifice were two or three villagers, and!"


---
It was like a re- enactment by the ghosts of their former selves of
 the similar scene which had taken place at Melchester years before.

---
When the books were signed
---
All's
---
well that ends well
---
" May you long be happy together, after thus having been' saved as by
 fire.'"


---
They came down the nearly empty building, and. 
---
Gillingham wanted, and. 
---
they'll
 all say'."


---
When the schoolmaster got back
---
" It is, and
---
for our
 good socially to do this
---
that's its justification,." 
---
if it was not
 my reason
---
The rain was coming
 down. 
---
"-- that's! 
---
If you
 ca n't take me and
---
who spoke thus
---
" Then you turn me away?"


---
" Oh, but ca n't you have the kindness to take me in? 
---
if you talk about them
---
The house is full
---
"

" That would be a palace for me!"


---
There is no bedstead in it."


---
" A bit of a bed could be made on the floor. 
---
It would be good enough
 for me."


---
You may remember me as barmaid at the Lamb and Flag formerly
---
The householder said. 
---
And an arrangement
 was ultimately come to
---
under which a bed was,
---
While they were waiting
---
for this to be done
---
You know
 the news
---
what you mean
---
that the wedding was yesterday
---
if it had

---
" No, no: of course you do n't. 
---
Only it shows! 
---
If it's done
---
", so Anny says. 
---
when they met for a moment on the stairs or in the
 passage
---
No-- the temptations are too many
---
, the shops being shut.


---
if you like
---
While they sat without speaking
---
" You seem all
 in a brood, old man
---
It's no business of mine, but
---
if it really did take place--
---
if you wanted

---
could you?
---
" You
 can ask about it
---
if you like
---
It must have been very private,."


---
if-- they have married
---
" They are married."


---
" Yes-- of course they are!
---
" Anny says!"


---
" How do you mean sad? 
---
"

" Yes-- that was it. 
---
Mrs. Edlin was much upset by it all, and. 
---
though others do n't
---
any ca nt
---
" It is n't
---
some to spare
---
The evening passed, and
---
Only you must help me: and."


---
you can do
 no less, after what I've stood' ee
---
you to do
 to- night
---
All is not."


---
you'd soon get tired of giving yourself airs and keeping
 away
---
That's all I say.
---
" You've come, Arabella
---
that's all! 
---
You are not well.

---
Now you must have something better than that." 
---
You shall have a liqueur
---
You shall have maraschino, or
 curaçao dry or sweet, or cherry brandy. 
---
mine go damn
---
When they had drunk
---
as it were,

---
personally conducted through the varieties of spirituous delectation
 by one who knew the landmarks well
---
which
 was not a little,
---
what happens to me
---
The closing hour
 came, and
---
they were compelled.


---
When they were in the streets
---
what our
 landlord will say to my bringing you home in this state
---
we
 are fastened out
---
" That's the worst of not having a home of your own. 
---
what we had
---
nobody will see you at
 all; and
---
by to- morrow morning you'll be all right
---
the devil does
---
" What it matter
 to me?"


---
They went along together, in
 need of support.

"
---
This-- is th' Martyrs'--burning- place
---
as they
 dragged across a broad street
---
that at the burning of Ridley, Doctor
 Smith-- preached sermon, and_'
---
my body
 to be burned
---
have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.'_--Often
 think of it
---
Ridley was a--
---
" Why, yes it has! 
---
ah you
 do n't understand!--it! 
---
what you like with me
---
to nobody else, till death us do part
---
It is-- hic-- never
 too late-- hic to mend!"


---
The circumstances were not altogether unlike those of their entry
 into the cottage at Cresscombe, such a long time before. 
---
as you can
---
" It is as dark as pitch
---
That's it. 
---
" But-- are we out in our old house by Marygreen?"
---
And where
 are my books? 
---
That's?"


---
" We are at my house, dear
---
, where there's nobody. 
---
how ill
 you are
---
Now-- third stair, fourth stair-- that's it. 
---
Now we shall
 get on."




---
it was ready
---
You must mind the shop this morning
---
If you live here
---
you must put your shoulder to the wheel
---
,
 at least the business started!"


---
What's that?"


---
What we've
---
to do is."


---
as we were
---
" How was that?"


---
Whatever you advance
---
How are you now, dear?"
---
" It is I-- Arabella."


---
You gave me shelter... 
---
That's!"


---
There's nobody in the house but father and me,
 and
---
you can rest. 
---
till you are thoroughly well
---
that you are knocked up
---
what they are thinking at the lodgings
---
Perhaps you had?"


---
me pay up,
---
they'll think
---
we've run away
---
You'll find enough money in my pocket there."


---
Scarcely half an hour had elapsed
---
how they had come there
---
what their coming signalized
---
Well, that will
 be the licence
---
You must pay for the liquor. 
---
A few
 friends, and a quiet convivial party would be the thing,. 
---
if we could
 get it up
---
It would advertise the shop, and."


---
" That can be got up easy enough by anybody who'll afford victuals and
 drink... 
---
Well yes-- it would advertise the shop
---
-- that's true."


---
nevertheless that party
 advertised it well, and
---
the Donns acquired a real notoriety among a
 certain class in Christminster who knew not the colleges, nor their
 works, nor their ways
---
they knew,
---
There were none in, but
---
the guests sitting round, card- playing, and drinking, and

---
how the party went
 off
---
if they caroused late the night before
---
though the
 shutters of the meat- stall were not down
---
Hosts and guests were sitting card- playing, smoking, and talking,

---
; the gas was

---
the curtains drawn,
---
though it had been broad daylight
 for two hours out of doors
---
" Here we are, just the same. 
---
We
 ought
---
, ought n't we? 
---
But it is a sort of
 housewarming. 
---
, you see; and
---
our friends are in no hurry
---
The tinker, or rather reduced ironmonger, was nothing loath, and
. 
---
It seemed, all of a
 sudden."


---
" So you are. 
---
Well, we've been waiting for certain legal hours,
---
,
 as we find
---
we ca n't do without one another after all
---
So, as a
 bright notion, we agreed."


---
till it was late enough
---
The entrance of Taylor infused fresh
 spirit into the company, and
---
they remained
---
:" Now we may as well go."

"
---
But the parson do n't know?"


---
that we might come between eight and
 nine, quiet as possible; on account of it being our second marriage, which
 might make people curious to look on if they knew
---
as there were reasons of decency for doing it as early and

---
as you promised
---
" You've promised.
---
several times as we've sat here to- night
---
These gentlemen have heard
 you."


---
" You and my daughter have been living here together these
 three or four days, quite on the understanding. 
---
that you were going
---
As a point of honour you must do it
 now."


---
It is a
 mere rhetorical figure-- what they call in the books, hyperbole."


---
who shelter you
---
off we'll go
---
They shook hands. 
---
they went.


---
while we are gone
---
when we come back

---
we'll all have some. 
---
A good strong cup of tea will set everybody
 right for going home."




---
the assembled guests yawned themselves wider awake, and
. 
---
Tinker Taylor, being
 the most sober, reasoned the most lucidly.


---
" But it do seem a
 rare curiosity! 
---
for a couple to marry over again
---
they could
---
when their minds were limp
---
" Do you think?"


---
Did n't you hear?"


---
that have
 been in circulation
---
To be sure, halfpence ca n't be expected. 
---
that's been knocking about the four
 hemispheres for some time
---
The curtains were undrawn, and the
 expression of the house made to look like morning. 
---
Some of the
 guests, however, fell asleep in their chairs. 
---
One or two went to the
 door, and. 
---
" By Gad, they are coming! 
---
the deed's done
---
They are walking in a very unusual way;
 and
---
that's the meaning of it!"


---
They waited in silence. 
---
till the wedding- party could be heard
---
Mrs. Fawley, I presume?" said Tinker Taylor with mock courtesy.


---
There's the padlock
---
you have
---
both
 done the right and proper thing
---
you ought now
---
as you have forgiven each other
---
What God hath

---
But, Jude, my dear, you were enough to make a cat
 laugh! 
---
You walked that straight, and
---
that
 one would have thought
---
you were going' prentice to a judge
---
you were seeing double all the time, from the way you fumbled
 with my finger
---
I said I'd do anything" And I've done it!"

 Well now, old deary, come along and."


---
There's no more left. 
---
The tea will take
 the muddle out of our heads, and
---
we shall be as fresh as larks."


---
It is true religion! 
---
"



 VIII


 Michaelmas came and
---
who had lived but

---
it was now
 precarious. 
---
to keep' ee
 entirely-- that's! 
---
what' twill come to
---
black- pot
 and sausages, and hawk'em about the street
---
Why
 did n't you keep your health,? 
---
You were well
 enough when the wedding was!"


---
that could be
 vouchsafed to me
---
that the greatest mercy would be
---
that something should serve me
---
This was the sort of discourse that went on between them every day
 now. 
---
who had heard
---
that they were a
 queer couple,
---
The landlord of the lodging, had doubted; and
---
if they were married at all,
---
that they must be respectable
---
what it was
---
" What in the name-- do you want?"


---
" It is!"


---
" It is just in order not to insult you. 
---
You
 know
---
" You've no respect for marriage whatever, or its rights and duties!"


---
" What DOES it matter! 
---
what my opinions are-- a wretch like me
---
Can
 it matter to anybody in the world who comes to see me for half an
 hour-- here with one foot in the grave!... 
---
" What do you want? 
---
how you are for
---
as the words were spoken
---
everything to gain by it-- my own death not
 being the least part
---
there's no meaning in what I
 say
---
" What do you want?
---
me to do
---
But what
 it is worth
---
" You could n't kill the pig, but
---
you could kill me!"


---
" Ah-- there you have me! 
---
you were ill,
---
that lives on a drop and a crumb
---
neither
 was there any note of reply. 
---
that your duty towards your
 invalid was
---
Now where the
 devil is!
---
A driving rain from the north- east had been falling with more or less
 intermission all the morning, and. 
---
it seemed impossible
---
it became a certainty

---
much stared at by other passengers
---
to which has weakness afforded a sorry foundation
---
at
 half- past three o'clock stood by the familiar well at Marygreen.

---
The rain was keeping everybody indoors
---
one evidently
 allowed out before hours for some reason or other
---
the child came.

"
---
The child departed, and
---
Everything
 was new, except a few pieces of carving preserved from the wrecked
 old fabric, now fixed against the new walls. 
---
which might have been accounted no more than an
 added drip to the rainfall
---
A light footstep,, sounded in the porch, and
---
it was you
---
" This is my last time! 
---
it would be less intrusive
---
We are

---
' the letter killeth'!"


---
" But why did you
 come, and?"


---
as you
 have done
---
It was in the Alfredston paper. 
---
And therefore
 you did so well--
---
God above-- and is that all I've come to hear? 
---
If there is anything
 more degrading, immoral, unnatural, than another in my life
---
You are mine."


---
me rush away from you
---
how you did it
---
-- how you think it!"


---
And you mustn't-- will you--
---
Oh you darling little fool
---
You seem! 
---
Or is it
---
what
 you pretend to
---
raised by an affected belief
---
How can you be so cruel!"


---
that it has ever been my lot to behold! 
---
your
 scorn of convention gone
---
" You crush
---
It has
 been-- only a church marriage-- an apparent marriage I mean! 
---
" it is a nominal marriage only. 
---
It hasn't been more than that
 at all!"


---
If misery can know happiness
---
Now, in the name of all you hold holy, and no lie. 
---
You do love me still?"


---
You know it too well!... 
---
" And yet you are so dear!--and
---
you look so ill--"

"
---
And so do you! 
---
There's one more, in memory of our dead little
 children-- yours and mine!"


---
me make my last appeal
---
We've both
 remarried out of our senses. 
---
You were
 the same. 
---
; you were creed- drunk. 
---
Either form of
 intoxication takes away the nobler vision... 
---
us then shake off
 our mistakes, and
---
Why do you tempt me so far, Jude! 
---
It is too
 merciless!... 
---
from which the path
 ran across the fields
---
There are cold spots up and down Wessex in autumn and winter weather;
 but the coldest of all when a north or east wind is blowing
---
is the
 crest of the down by the Brown House, where the road to Alfredston
 crosses the old Ridgeway. 
---
Here the first winter sleets and snows
 fall and and
---
here the spring frost lingers last unthawed. 
---
as it was,
---
It was still there; but. 
---
nearly
 obliterated by moss
---
It was dark. 
---
that began
---
You've been
---
" Well, now you'd best march along home."


---
whether you know it
---
What-- to commit suicide?
---
You think; and
---
you are the stronger
---
so
 you are, in a physical sense, now. 
---
You could push me over like a
 nine- pin. 
---
You did not send that letter the other day, and
---
as
 you think
---
who had only two wishes left in
 the world
---
which ought never

---
Lord-- you do talk lofty! 
---
Wo n't you have something warm to drink?"


---
's get home
---
They went along by the silent colleges, and
---
What are you looking at?
---
, those spirits of the dead again,
 on this my last walk, that I saw!"


---
" What a curious chap you are!"


---
them rustling
---
that has been spoilt for me by the grind of stern reality
---
as where there was nobody
---
" They seem!"


---
They used, and! 
---
Gibbon, and Johnson, and Dr. Browne,
 and Bishop Ken--"

" Come along do
---
There's
---
The Poet of Liberty used, and the great
 Dissector of Melancholy there!"


---
They bore me."


---
" Walter Raleigh is beckoning to me from that lane-- Wycliffe-- Harvey--
 Hooker-- Arnold-- and
---
a whole crowd of Tractarian Shades--"

" I DON'T WANT
---
Upon my soul you are more sober when you've been
 drinking than when you have not!"


---
" This is old Rubric. 
---
And that Sarcophagus; and up that lane Crozier
 and Tudor: and all down there is Cardinal with its long front, and
 its windows with lifted eyebrows, representing the polite surprise of
 the university at the efforts of such as I.
---
It will help me home,. 
---
as if death- claws were grabbing me through
 and through
---
As Antigone said
---
my spirit flitting
 up and down here among these
---
You may n't die after all. 
---
It was night at Marygreen, and
---
the rain of the afternoon showed no
 sign of abatement. 
---
walking the streets of Christminster homeward, the Widow Edlin
 crossed the green, and.


---
" Lord love' ee, what do ye do that yourself for, when I've come o'
 purpose! 
---
You knew."


---
should ye? 
---
you'll keep two servants. '
---
This pretty body of mine
 has been the ruin of me already!"


---
" Pshoo-- you've got no body to speak of! 
---
You put me more in mind
 of a sperrit. 
---
But there seems something wrong to- night, my dear.

---
" Then what is it?"


---
said the widow. 
---
" But it sha n't be! 
---
; it is
 not necessary. 
---
very well as it is
---
It ought. 
---
To reverse it will be terrible-- but
---
" What is it
---
It is something... 
---
that nobody would admit it as a reason for feeling as I do;

---
so that no excuse is left me
---
what it was
---
" I've heard strange tales o' husbands in my time," observed the widow
 in a lowered voice. 
---
" They say. 
---
when the saints were upon the
 earth devils
---
why that should
 come into my head,
---
for it is only a tale
---
What a wind and rain it
 is to- night! 
---
you ought
---
" It is my duty. 
---
" No-- no-- don't go, Mrs. Edlin
---
" But it is bedtime, child."


---
" Yes, but-- there's the little spare room-- my room that was. 
---
It is
 quite ready. 
---
Please stay, Mrs. Edlin!--I shall want you in the
 morning."


---
if you wish
---
" Oh well-- I do n't mind,.  Nothing will happen to my four
 old walls,."


---
they ascended the stairs
 together.

"
---
which had

---
Sue unlatched the other chamber door, and, as if seized with
 faintness, sank down outside it. 
---
The snoring had quite ceased for some time, but
---
Are
 you in bed, Mrs. Edlin
---
the widow, opening the door
---
it takes me a long while to un- ray. 
---
's go and
---
But the rain and the
 wind is so loud."


---
that you can hardly hear anything but between
 whiles
---
The widow retreated a second time.


---
Is that you, Susanna?"


---
" What do you want? 
---
When we were at Shaston
---
that
 you should come near me
---
" Perhaps you only think? 
---
you ought
---
we were going
---
till we
 did
---
" Come-- this is pretty bad, after what I've done! 
---
But,, that portion of
 the scene remained untold. 
---
it overcame me.

---
-- you really mean
 this?
---
" Perhaps you'll swear it on the New Testament?"


---
You know. 
---
what it means
---
Having you back in the
 house was one thing-- this another. 
---
" That's a complaisant spirit-- and. 
---
perhaps you are right
---
a
 lover hanging about
---
With, a half- marriage should be completed. 
---
" I will."

" Now I supplicate you, Richard, to whom I belong, and whom I wish to
 honour and obey, as I vowed,."

" I have thought-- I wish this!"

 But I
 repeat my reminder this third and last time."

" It is my wish!...  O God!"


---
" What did you say' O God' for?"


---
Yes you do! 
---
it might end like this
---
" What's the matter
---
" You shrink from me again?--just as formerly!"


---
" You wish?"


---
" You still bear in mind?"


---
what it means
---
It is my duty!"


---
Mrs. Edlin had by this time undressed, and. 
---
if the
 little thing is all right
---
How it do blow and!"


---
The widow went out on the landing, and. " Ah!

---
Weddings be funerals' a b'lieve nowadays. 
---
Times have changed
 since then!"




---
if you
 haven't been clever in this last stroke
---
Moving the blocks always used to strain
 me, and standing the trying draughts in buildings before the windows
 are in always gave me colds, and
---
that began the mischief
 inside
---
if the
 founders had such as I in their minds-- a fellow good for nothing else
 but that particular thing
---
that soon there is going
---
There are
 schemes afoot for making the university less exclusive, and. 
---
And it is too late, too
 late for me! 
---
How you keep a- mumbling
---
you'd have got over all that craze about books by this time
---
And so
 you would, if you'd had any sense. 
---
You are as bad now
 as when we were first married."


---
you'd mind
---
who you are talking to
---
how things were going, and

---
you want
---
if you like
---
" Oh-- that's a change!"


---
"

 Mrs. Edlin hesitated
---
Well, no-- it's different now. 
---
The night after you came. 
---
-- you darling
---
Then bitter affliction came to us, and
---
And now the ultimate
 horror has come! 
---
that the
 very wind seemed
---
when we were at our own best
---
Our ideas were fifty years too soon.

---
There-- this, Mrs. Edlin, is. 
---
which started a fit of coughing
---
Presently there
 came a knock at the door downstairs. 
---
As nobody answered it
---
Mrs.
 Edlin herself went down.


---
The visitor said blandly:" The Doctor." 
---
How is my patient at present?"
---
Vilbert went; but. 
---
now so brought to bay by
 events and so forcibly, and with such striking epithets
---
, that Vilbert soon
 scurried downstairs again
---
Mrs. Edlin
 having left. 
---
that the Doctor looked ruffled,
---
" There's
 nobody but me about the house to- day."


---
What is this, my
 dear
---
that you sold me at the
 agricultural show, do n't you re- member?"


---
But you must be prepared for the
 consequences." 
---
if my

---
when leafy summer came round again
---
It was afternoon, and
---
some one to come and
---
Certain sounds from without revealed,
. 
---
that the town was in festivity
---
whatever it might have been
---
Bells began, and
---
the notes came into the room
 through the open window, and.

---
which was hung up by way of timepiece
---
The house
 was empty. 
---
The attraction to go abroad had

---
It was a warm, cloudless, enticing day. 
---
who had come up from the country for the
 day
---
People were picnicking on the grass, and
---
the carriages drawing
 up for the concert, numerous Dons and their wives, and undergraduates
 with gay female companions, crowding up likewise
---
the doors
 were closed, and
---
the concert began
---
The powerful notes of that concert rolled forth through the swinging
 yellow blinds of the open windows, over the housetops, and into the
 still air of the lanes. 
---
it was about this time.


---
The room remained still as before. 
---
oh please!"

 No water came, and
---
the organ notes, faint as a bee's hum, rolled in
 as before.


---
The hurrahs were repeated,. 
---
the day perish the night in which it
 was said
---
There is a man- child conceived.
---
that day be darkness
---
the light shine upon it
---
that night be solitary,
---
no
 joyful voice come therein
---
; they hear not the voice of the
 oppressor... 
---
The small and the great are there; and
---
what was going on
---
A corridor was in course of erection from
 the entrance to the hall staircase, of gay red and buff bunting.

---
Waggon- loads of boxes containing bright plants in full bloom were

---
the great staircase was covered with red
 cloth. 
---
where they were putting
 down a new floor and
---
The cathedral bell close at hand was sounding for five o'clock
 service.


---
-- there's a lot to do. 
---
" We are just going down
 to the river
---
," said the former,". 
---
But we've
 called round on our way."


---
" That's right. 
---
Well now, ca n't you give yourself half an hour's
 relaxation, Mrs. Fawley, and? '
---
Twould do you
 good."


---
it is good fun."


---
They waited, and
---
where the
 procession of boats was
---
" to
 see the boats himself-- that's!"


---
what it is
---
A second glance caused, and
---
; they were cold,. 
---
All was still within. 
---
The
 bumping of near thirty years had ceased.


---
what had happened
---
Then meditating another moment or
 two, softly closed it as before, and.


---
said one of the workmen. 
---
" We wondered. 
---
if you were

---
Come along; we must be quick to get a good
 place... 
---
Of course, we do n't
 want"


---
They went with the crowd down Cardinal Street, where they presently
 reached the bridge, and
---
the gay barges burst upon their view. 
---
they passed by a narrow slit down to the riverside path--
---
as they had arrived
---
Almost as soon the grand
 procession of boats began; the oars smacking with a loud kiss on the
 face of the stream, as they were lowered from the perpendicular.


---
The blue flag of the boat club denoted the
 centre of interest,
---
Collegians of all
 sorts, in canoes with ladies, watching keenly for" our" boat
---
That philtre is operating
---
", you know
---
" Shame
 on' ee to wreck a heart so!"


---
It is a general holiday."


---
which act
 could be performed unobserved in the crowd
---
The crowd surged,, and
---
The fun on the water reached the acme of excitement
---
; there were
 immersions
---
, there were shouts
---
: the race was lost and
---
won, the pink
 and blue and yellow ladies retired from the barges, and
---
who had watched
---
the people
 began.


---
" Well-- it's been awfully good
---
" What's your hurry?"


---
Dear, dear, this is awkward!"


---
where the people ascended from the riverside
 path to the bridge
---
At the narrow gangway the crowd was literally jammed into one hot
 mass-- Arabella and Vilbert with the rest; and
---
here they remained
 motionless,!"
---
an inquest might be deemed necessary.


---
What a fidget you are, my love
---
the physician,, had no need of personal
 effort for contact
---
: there's!"


---
It was nearly ten minutes. 
---
before the wedged multitude moved
 sufficiently
---
them pass through
---
" Can you come and
?"


---
being nearly knocked down by the carriages
---
It is just round here
---
", is n't it? 
---
when the sky was equally cloudless, and
---
The window was still open, and. 
---
it being
---
about
 noontide the clear air was motionless and quiet without
---
From a
 distance came voices; and an apparent noise of persons stamping.


---
" What's that?"
---
" Oh, that's the Doctors in the theatre,. 
---
conferring Honorary degrees
 on the Duke of Hamptonshire and a lot more illustrious gents of that
 sort
---
It's Remembrance Week. 
---
, you know
---
An occasional word, as from some one making a speech, floated from
 the open windows of the theatre across to this quiet corner, at which
 there seemed
---
The bells struck out joyously; and
---
their
 reverberations travelled round the bed- room.


---
D'ye think
---
" That's... 
---
what we do n't know
---
' tis to be believed
---
it wo n't be true
