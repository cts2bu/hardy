 the instrument standing- room there.

It came from an old woman who had emerged from her door towards the
 garden gate of a green- thatched cottage not far off. 
---
she
 continued, as the boy,

that it was perhaps a very good plan of
 Miss or Mrs. Fawley's(, and

as they called her indifferently)

 continued, in frowning pleasantry.

 better one.  His cousin Sue is just the same-- so I've heard; but

" Ah!" said his aunt,.

And she opened upon him
 a lecture on how she would now have him all the spring upon her hands
 doing nothing.

More angry with Jude for demeaning her by coming there than for
 dereliction of duty, she rated him primarily from that point of view,
 and only secondarily from a moral one.

she told him more yet
 of the romantic charms of the city of light and lore.

; in front of
 it, beside the brook, three young women were kneeling, with buckets
 and platters beside them containing heaps of pigs' chitterlings,
 which they were washing in the running water

She was a fine dark- eyed girl, not exactly
 handsome, but capable of passing as such at a little distance,
 despite some coarseness of skin and fibre. 
---
She had a round and
 prominent bosom, full lips, perfect teeth, and the rich complexion
 of a Cochin hen's egg. 
---
She was a complete and substantial female
 animal-- no more, no less; and

" Shall I clamber across, or

Perhaps she foresaw an opportunity

 affinity_ in posse_ between herself and him, which, so far as Jude
 Fawley was concerned, had no sort of premeditation in it. 
---
She saw

---
as a woman is singled out
 in such cases, for no reasoned purpose of further acquaintance,
---
Springing to her feet, she said:"."


---
As the girl drew nearer to it
---
, she gave without Jude
. 
---
she
 brought as by magic upon its smooth and
---
which she was able to retain there as long as she continued
 to smile
---
her to explain instead of by hailing him
---
why she had audaciously
 stopped him by this novel artillery
---
But she, slyly looking in another direction,;
---
swayed herself backwards
 and forwards on her hand till,
 moved by amatory curiosity

, she turned her eyes critically upon him.

She nodded towards the
 fragment on the grass.

" Do!"

" Arabella Donn.

which was uttered very distinctly
 by Arabella's personality
---
" What a nice- looking girl you are!"
---
" she said piquantly.


---
" I do n't suppose?"
---
I could
---
She had spoken this without
 a smile, and
---
By this time she had managed. 
---
She brightened with a little glow of triumph,.


---
Meanwhile the girl had joined her companions, and
---
she silently
 resumed her flicking and sousing of the chitterlings in the pellucid
 stream.


---
" Catched un, my dear?" laconically asked the girl called Anny.

She would wait
 indoors, poor girl, and.

There was a something in her, too,. 
---
which tended towards the embrace of a woman for whom he had no
 respect
---
just as Arabella came downstairs
 in radiant walking attire
---
" she whispered to Jude.


---
Arabella looked so handsome amid her untidy surroundings that he felt
 glad he had come, and
---
First they clambered to the top of the great down, during which
 ascent he had occasionally to take her hand to assist her. 
---
that the sun was anything else than a useful
 lamp for illuminating Arabella's face
---
," said Arabella. 
---
the
 distance being altogether about half- a- dozen miles from Marygreen,
 and three from Arabella's
---
Arabella said, and
---
she would like some tea
---
as she met the serious and
 tender gaze of her lover-- the low and triumphant laugh of a careless
 woman who sees she is winning her game.


---
Arabella tasted it. 
---
" Ugh!" she said.


---
She mentioned three or four
 ingredients that she detected in the liquor beyond malt and hops,
 much to Jude's surprise.


---
Nevertheless she returned to the beer and, and
---
She wondered, but
---
She took it, thoroughly, up to the shoulder. 
---
" Yes," said she;
---
" How fast I have become!
---
From
 this point the only way of getting to Arabella's was by going up the
 incline, and dipping again into her valley on the right. 
---
Arabella tittered lightly.


---
For answer she inclined her head upon his shoulder. 
---
as she had desired,
---
," she said gently.


---
how trusting she was
---
Thus they slowly went towards her home. 
---
She asked him. 
---
as if she had been out alone in the dark
---
Arabella, on the contrary, made them public among all her friends
 and acquaintances.


---
She was
 not there now, and
---
An hour and a half later Arabella came along the same way with her
 two companions of the Saturday. 
---
She passed unheedingly the scene of
 the kiss, and the willow that marked it, the other two.

"
---
And she related almost word for word some of his
 tenderest speeches. 
---
In a few moments Arabella replied in a curiously low, hungry tone of
 latent sensuousness:"! 
---
I've got
---
But I want
 him to more than care for me
---
; I want! 
---
I
 must have him. 
---
I ca n't do without him. 
---
I shall go mad! 
---
if I ca n't give myself to him altogether
---
I
 felt!"


---
I should

Arabella remained thinking awhile. 
---

 asked.


---
The third girl looked at the second. 
---
" She DON'T know!"


---
she do n't
---
Arabella's companions looked at each other, and. 
---
Then one went up close to Arabella, and,

---
the other observing curiously the effect upon Arabella
---
that I should say a sojer, or sailor, or commercial gent from
 the towns, or any of them that be slippery with poor women I'd do
" I own I did n't think of that
 way!... " Nothing venture nothing have! 
---
Lots of girls do it; or
---
Arabella pursued her way in silent thought. 
---
she
 whispered; but not to them.




---
that she
 was endeavouring unassisted to drive them in through the door which
 she had set open
---
The lines of her countenance changed from the
 rigidity of business to the softness of love
---
when she saw Jude, and

---
she bent her eyes languishingly upon him. 
---
she cried,. 
---
if I do n't follow!" said she. 
---
She rushed in full pursuit out of the garden, Jude alongside her,
 barely contriving to keep the fugitive in sight. 
---
She gave him her now hot hand with apparent willingness,
 and
---
"," she remarked. 
---
" It is no good!" cried Arabella. 
---
Without relinquishing her hold of Jude's hand she swerved aside and

---
She lay supine, and straight as an arrow, on the sloping sod of this
 hill- top, gazing up into the blue miles of sky, and still retaining
 her warm hold of Jude's hand. 
---
," she went on, her form heaving
 and falling in quick pants
---
, her face flushed, her full red lips
 parted, and a fine dew of perspiration on her skin. 
---

---
," said she.


---
" No-- I ca n't see
 it
---
She gently pulled him down beside her.


---
she said crossly,.


---
" I do n't care, dear
---
to see it: why should I?
---
She rolled round her face,
---
" Sha n't!" she said.


---
She kept her two lips resentfully together, and
---
till she slackened her pace and
---
Arabella went in,
.


---
" I expect
---
I took too much liberty with her, somehow
---
On Sunday morning the interior of Arabella's home was, as usual,
 the scene of a grand weekly cooking, the preparation of the special
 Sunday dinner. 
---
her mother and Arabella herself were
. 
---
A neighbour passed on her way home from
 morning service at the nearest church, and
---
Donn engaged at
 the window with the razor
---
She at once spoke playfully to Arabella:"!
---
Arabella merely threw a look of consciousness into her face without
 raising her eyes.


---
Arabella said suddenly to her mother:
". 
---
I want
---
Only I want the house to myself. 
---
I ca n't
 get un. 
---
I shall let"


---
if I do n't mind
---
much as I care for' n!
---
In the afternoon Arabella met and. 
---
," said Arabella, who had attended to the sounds.


---
When they arrived at her house
---
" Wait a moment," said she. 
---
She tried the handle of the door and

---
," she added. 
---
she found the key and
---
" she asked lightly. 
---
She took off her jacket and hat,
 and
---
" Do n't touch me, please," she said softly. 
---
" I am part egg- shell.
---
Or
 perhaps I had better put it in a safe place." 
---
She began.


---
said her lover.


---
She put her hand into her bosom and. 
---
Having exhibited it to him she put it back,
". 
---
for a woman to want to

---
She had turned round her chair, and,,
.


---
There!" she said defiantly,!" 
---
She had quickly
 withdrawn the egg a second time; but
---
she had put it back as quickly,. 
---
Her face flushed; and.


---
But she had jumped up too. 
---
she cried.


---
Her lover followed her. 
---
as she withdrew
---
he could not discover for a long
 time what had become of her,
---
her to have rushed
 up the stairs
---
Arabella seemed dissatisfied
---
; she
 was always imagining, and.


---
One day she met the itinerant Vilbert. 
---
She, like all the cottagers
 thereabout, knew the quack well, and
---
she began. 
---
Arabella had been gloomy, but
---
she
 had grown brighter. 
---
That evening she kept an appointment with Jude,
 who seemed sad.


---
Arabella began. 
---
she
 said. 
---
I have n't told you yet!"
---
and
 she looked into his face with streaming eyes.


---
that
 Arabella was not worth a great deal as a specimen of womankind
---
who had drifted so far into intimacy with a woman
---
Arabella's parents being among them
---
Fawley's aunt being a baker
---
she made him a bride- cake,; and
---
Of this cake Arabella took some slices,_
---
His wife was absolutely useless in a
 town- lodging, where he at first had considered it would be necessary
 for them to live. 
---
Arabella, however, felt;

---
she had gained a husband
---
which Arabella wore
---
A long tail of
 hair, twisted up in an enormous knob at the back
 of her head, was deliberately unfastened,.


---
that, for all, many unsophisticated girls
 would and did go to towns and
---
A new- made wife can usually manage,. 
---
There is a certain piquancy about her situation, and
 her manner to her acquaintance at the sense of it, which carries off
 the gloom of facts, and renders even the humblest bride independent
 awhile of the real. 
---
when she
 met Anny her former friend, whom she had not seen since the wedding
---
Nevertheless it was with a little uneasiness that Arabella approached
 the time when in the natural course of things she would have to
.

---
she had raised
---
When she came into
 the room he was between sleeping and waking, and.


---
her undressing before the little looking- glass
---
as she sat
---
that she
 was amusing herself by artificially producing in each cheek the
 dimple before alluded to,
---
She turned and. 
---
she
 said. 
---
that I know of
---
when
 I was at the public- house
---
" I do n't care about dimples. 
---
I do n't think.
---
they improve a
 woman-- particularly a married woman, and of full- sized figure like
 you
---
" I do n't care,. 
---
" I used."


---
when I was serving in the tap- room
---
I thought."


---
when I married you
---
I was a little
 more finished than I could have been by staying where I was born
---
I was eating my head off, so
---
I
 went away for three months.
---
I made a mistake."


---
as I was
---
Why, of course, so unprepared, without a stick of
 furniture, and hardly a shilling, I should n't have hurried on our
 affair, and!"


---
before I was ready
---
" I have no more to say!"


---
she lost, for that matter,? 
---
" I'm afraid the pig- killer wo n't be able to come
---
Jude's wife came downstairs.


---
she asked.


---
She went out,. 
---
I'll show
 you
---
Or I'll do it myself--
---
I think. 
---
I could

A robin peered down at the preparations
 from the nearest tree, and,. 
---
By this time Arabella had joined
 her husband, and Jude, rope in hand,. 
---
Arabella opened the sty- door, and
---
Arabella bound him down,.


---
she cried. 
---
" she cried,"! 
---
The
 blood flowed out in a torrent instead of in the trickling stream she
 had desired. 
---
" Make!" said Arabella. 
---
I do n't want." 
---
, she slipped it into the gash, and. 
---
"," she said.


---
," said she. 
---
" There!" she cried, thoroughly in a passion. 
---
" Now I ca n't make any
 blackpot. 
---
" she said scornfully. 
---
I know
---
I know
---
said Arabella. 
---
"," said Arabella,.

---
as his wife had called him,
---
who had been Arabella's
 companions
---
One of the girls was talking to a friend in a shed,. 
---
I put her up to it! 
---
' Nothing venture nothing
 have,' I said.  If I had n't she'd no more have been his mis'ess than
 I."

"'

she knew

when she told
 him

---
What had Arabella been put up to by this woman,
---
Arabella however, was busy
 melting down lard from fat of the deceased pig, for she had been out
 on a jaunt all day, and so delayed her work. 
---
But Arabella was very talkative, and. 
---
that she wanted some money
---
Her defensive manner collapsed. 
---

---
" Every woman has a right to do such as that. 
---
" I quite deny it, Bella. 
---
She might

But she should not go and."


---
" Then I must do it to- morrow morning.

 o'clock; and

As she warmed

she saw some of

 petulantly; and.

Arabella's hands had

her fingers consequently
 left very perceptible imprints on the book- covers.

She continued

caught her by the arms

it rolled about her ears.


---
" Let!" she said.


---
She hesitated. 
---
she repeated.


---
After a pause:" I do."


---
she crossed the room to the door,
 out of which she went with a set face, and into the highway. 
---
Here
 she began. 
---
she
 now presented,
---
to stare at the extraordinary spectacle bonnetless, her dishevelled hair blowing in the wind,
 her bodice apart, her sleeves rolled above her elbows for her work,
 and
---
her hands reeking with melted fat. 
---
she cried. 
---
not what she did
---
I ought" she asked.

---
But she said no more,
 and. 
---
till she was tired

" Aunt-- did

She raised her ancient eyes under the rim of the by- gone bonnet that
 she always wore. 
---
she said.


---
" I have heard, and."


---
, I s'pose; though your wife-- I reckon' twas

---
she-- must have been a fool to open up that! 
---
Your
 mother soon afterwards died

-- she drowned herself, in short, and
---
she so disliked. 
---
that she went
 away to London with her little maid
---
how Arabella would receive him in his
 new aspect
---
she would know, and
---
if she came back
---
she had not visited the
 house
---
That she had gone tired of him
---
she frankly admitted. 
---
she did not care for the sort of life he
 led. 
---
She further went on. 
---
that her parents had, for

---
she proposed,. 
---
A woman of her sort would have more chance over there
 than in this stupid country.


---
since she wished, and one that might
 be to the advantage of both
---
that she might sell them with the rest, or as
 many of them as she should choose
---
She must have thrown it in with the
 rest of her property at the auction.

that Arabella and her parents had

---
since she was bent on going

" Yet I am a man

 was
---
His grand- aunt had gruffly replied.


---
that she was his cousin
 Sue Bridehead, of the inimical branch of the family; and
---
that the girl lived in
 Christminster
---
though she did not know where, or
---
what she was doing
---
His aunt would not give him the photograph. 
---
One of the spectres( was now apostrophizing her thus:

" Beautiful city!
---
Her ineffable charm
 keeps ever calling us to the true goal of all of us, to the ideal, to
 perfection."


---
when I read the epitaphs of the beautiful, every inordinate
 desire
---
when I meet with the grief of parents upon a
 tombstone
---
when I see the tombs of
 the parents themselves
---
, I consider the vanity of grieving for those
 whom we must quickly follow
---
Teach me to live, that I may dread
      The grave as little as my bed.
     
---
thinking he
 had overslept himself and then said:

" By Jove-- I had quite forgotten my sweet- faced cousin, and... and my old schoolmaster, too." 
---
that she's
 here all the time!
---
She did so, with a request, however,
---
She seemed. 
---
the girl remained at Christminster. 
---
To
 make her still more objectionable, she was an artist or designer of
 some sort in what was called an ecclesiastical warehouse, which was
 a perfect seed- bed of idolatry, and
---
she was.
---
or
 the other, but the clue to her whereabouts was decidedly interesting.

---
to be kept entirely by women
---
; she was so

---
Then she spoke to one of the two older women behind the
 counter; and
---
What was she doing?

---
Before her lay a piece of zinc
---
Hereon she was designing or

---
Her presence here was now fairly enough. 
---
she was
---
She had used him roughly, but
---
she had

---
her being powerless to control him

---
She seemed
 so dainty beside himself in his rough working- jacket and dusty
 trousers that he felt he was as yet unready to encounter her, as he
 had felt about Mr. Phillotson. 
---
that she had
 inherited the antipathies of her family, and
---
she was there
---
But she
 remained more or less an ideal character, about whose form he began
 to weave curious and fantastic day- dreams.


---
She looked right into his face with
 liquid, untranslatable eyes, that combined, or seemed to him to
 combine, keenness with tenderness, and mystery with both, their
 expression, as well as that of her lips, taking its life from some
 words just spoken to a companion, and being carried on into his face
 quite unconsciously. 
---
She no more observed his presence than that of
 the dust- motes which his manipulations raised into the sunbeams.


---
her recognizing him
---
though as she had never once seen him
---
she could not possibly do so
---
though she was a country- girl at bottom, a latter
 girlhood of some years in London, and a womanhood here

When she was gone
---
that she was not a large
 figure,
---
that she was light and slight, of the type dubbed elegant
---
There was nothing statuesque in her
---
She was mobile, living, yet
---
a painter might
 not have called her handsome or beautiful. 
---
that she was

---
She was quite a long way removed from the rusticity
 that was his. 
---
the emotion spent on her being
 rigorously that of a kinsman and well- wisher

So would she be to him
 a kindly star, an elevating power, a companion in Anglican worship,
 a tender friend.




---
that she frequently attended there
---
She did not come, and
---
if she came at all
---
that she would approach the
 building along the eastern side of the great green quadrangle from
 which it was accessible, and
---
A few minutes before the hour for service she appeared as
 one of the figures walking along under the college walls, and
---
that Sue was among them
---
The girl to nourish an extraordinary
 tenderness was at this time; and
---
She was probably a frequenter of this place, and
---
as she must be by occupation and habit
---
till she had left her seat and
---
She did not look towards him, and
---
by the
 time she was half- way down the broad path.

---
She was such a stranger, and
---
Sue WAS his own kin, and the fact of his having a wife, even though
 she was not in evidence in this hemisphere
---
which she not only assisted but
---
She went along for
 a mile or two
---
until she came to much higher ground than that of the
 city she had left behind her. 
---
she was

---
On the other side of the stile, in the footpath, she beheld a
 foreigner with black hair and a sallow face, a number of plaster statuettes, some of them bronzed,
 which he was re- arranging before proceeding with them on his way.

---
Though the figures were many yards away from her the
 south- west sun
---
that she could discern their contours with luminous
 distinctness; and
---
they awoke in her
---
She shook her head.


---
" she said,.


---
she should have them for ten shillings
---
"," said Sue. 
---
She offered considerably less,
 and
---
She clasped them as treasures.


---
, she began. 
---
what she should do with them
---
They seemed so very
 large now that they were in her possession, and so very naked.

---
she trembled at her enterprise
---
When she handled them
---
the white pipeclay came off on her gloves and
 jacket. 
---
openly an idea came
 to her, and
---
After carrying them along a little way, pulling some huge burdock leaves, parsley, and other
 rank growths from the hedge, she wrapped up her burden as well as she
 could in these,.


---
what she carried
---
she
 said. 
---
But she was still in a trembling state, and.


---
she had not bought the figures
---
Occasionally peeping inside the leaves to see that Venus's arm was
 not broken, she entered with her heathen load into the most Christian
 city in the country by an obscure street running parallel to the main
 one, and. 
---
which she was attached
---
Her purchases were taken straight up to her
 own chamber, and
---
she at once attempted; but.


---
that was
 her very own property
---
she wrapped
 them in large sheets of brown paper
---
The mistress of the house, Miss Fontover, was an elderly lady in
 spectacles,; a dab at Ritual, as become
 one of her business, and a worshipper at the ceremonial church of St.
 Silas, in the suburb of Beersheba before- mentioned, which Jude also
 had begun to attend. 
---
She was the daughter of a clergyman in reduced
 circumstances, and
---
at his death,, she boldly avoided penury by taking over a little
 shop of church requisites and developing it to its present creditable
 proportions. 
---
She wore a cross and
---
beads round her neck as her only
 ornament, and.


---
She now came,.


---
that the girl did not
 respond for a moment,
---
" she asked,
.


---
" Yes-- just something to ornament my room," said Sue.

"
---
Well, I should have thought
---
I had put enough here already
---
She tore a little hole, about as big as a wafer,
 in the brown paper, and. 
---
what had been the merest
 passing fancy created in Sue a great zest for unpacking her objects
 and looking at them
---
when she was sure of being
 undisturbed
---
and at bedtime,, she unrobed the divinities in comfort. 
---
,
 she withdrew to the bed,. 
---
she had taken from her box, which Miss Fontover knew
 nothing of
---
she read the chapter
. 
---
Occasionally she
 looked up at the statuettes, which appeared strange and out of place,

---
, she at length jumped up and

---
which she read to the end. 
---
Presently she put out the candles,
 undressed, and finally extinguished her own light.


---
She was of an age which usually sleeps soundly, yet
---
to- night she
 kept, and
---
she opened her eyes
---
Sue was tossing and

---
her was
---
till the service was half over that one of the women

---
was Sue, who had perforce accompanied the elderly Miss Fontover
 thither
---
which she could
 hardly refuse
---
she frequented
---
she was almost an ideality to him still
---
Perhaps to know
 her would be. 
---
For Sue to be the loved one
 of a man who was licensed by the laws of his country to love Arabella
 and none other unto his life's end
---
that she is exceptionally bright
---
For whatever Sue's virtues, talents, or
 ecclesiastical saturation, it was certain.


---
On an afternoon at this time a young girl entered the stone- mason's
 yard with some hesitation, and,.


---
" That's a nice girl
---
" Who is she?
---
"-- I've seen her about here and there. 
---
Why, yes, she's
 the daughter of that clever chap Bridehead who did all the wrought
 ironwork at St. Silas' ten years ago, and. 
---
as
 she's come back here
---
Meanwhile the young woman had knocked at the office door and. 
---
she was out of sight. 
---
Sue's was of the most artless and natural kind. 
---
She addressed him
 as her dear cousin Jude
---
she had only just learnt by the merest
 accident that he was living in Christminster,
---
her know
---
,
 she said,. 
---
for she was thrown much upon herself, and
---
But now there was every probability of her soon
,
---
that she was going away
---
Arabella had been met in the same way, unfortunately, and
---
it might
 not seem respectable to a dear girl like Sue. 
---
Before either had reached it she called out to him:


---
till she showed signs of closing in,
---
," she said with the freedom of a friend. 
---
" I
 have really no place to ask anybody in to. 
---
What I meant
---
I suppose
---
I ought not
---
I
 mean gloomy and inauspicious in its associations... 
---
when I do n't know you yet
---
She looked him
 up and down curiously,.


---
than I know you
---
to know me more," she added.


---
" Yes-- I have seen you now and then."


---
who I was
---
And now I am going away!"


---
I have hardly any other friend. 
---
I have,
 indeed, one very old friend here somewhere, but
---
I wonder--
---
I think.
---
" No-- I only know of one Mr. Phillotson. 
---
I wonder. 
---
; I've directed books to him,."


---
though I've never seen him
---
when she had gone
---
She agreed, and
---
the rays fell on the nervous little face and vivacious
 dark eyes and hair of Sue, on the earnest features of her cousin,
 and on the schoolmaster's own maturer face and figure,.


---
Sue having, and
---
She was so
 vibrant
---
she did seemed
---
An exciting thought would make so fast that he could
 hardly keep up with her; and
---
her sensitiveness on some points
 was such that it might have been misread as vanity. 
---
She laughed.


---
," she continued. 
---
" She broke some statuary of mine."


---
She found it in my room, and
---
she
 threw it on the floor and,!"


---
No doubt she called them
 popish images and."


---
No...  No, she did n't do that. 
---
She saw the matter quite
 differently."


---
It was for quite some other reason that she did n't like my
 patron- saints. 
---
her see
---
she has

---
she has
---
Oh--, has she? 
---
Does she really think of
 adopting teaching as a profession?"


---
she was
---
that
 she had agreed. 
---
Sue had
 been taken as stop- gap. 
---
Having taught for
 some two years in London, though she had abandoned that vocation of
 late
---
, Miss Bridehead was not exactly a novice, and
---
there would be no difficulty in retaining her services, which he
 already wished to do,
---
though she had only been with him three or four
 weeks
---
her cross the road to the school
---
At twenty minutes to nine she did cross
---
, a light hat tossed
 on her head; and
---
which had nothing to do with her skill as a teacher
---
Sue
 remained all day
 under his eye. 
---
She certainly was an excellent teacher.


---
some article in the Code made it necessary that a respectable,
 elderly woman should be present at these lessons when the teacher and
 the taught were of different sexes. 
---
at whose house
 Sue lodged
---
where Mrs. Hawes, the widow, occupied herself with sewing
---
as she figured
---
-- she would involuntarily glance up with a little inquiring smile
 at him,
---
as if she assumed that,
---
Perhaps she
 knew.


---
"," said Sue to the schoolmaster,," that this model, elaborate as it is. 
---
as she stood with him a
 little in the background
---
I am sure this man does n't.
---
I fancy
---
"," she said,". 
---
She was silent,. 
---
for she was easily repressed; and
---
" Ah-- I did n't see him!"
---
she cried in her quick, light voice.

---
" Your cousin is so terribly clever that she criticizes it
 unmercifully
---
" She is
 quite sceptical as to its correctness."


---
what is
 called a clever girl
---
" answered
 Sue sensitively. 
---
I only meant
---
"-- I do n't know-- except
!"


---
what I meant
---
I_ know your meaning
---
She impulsively
 seized his hand, and
---
, her voice revealing a tremor which she herself
 felt to be absurdly uncalled for by sarcasm so gentle. 
---
She had not
 the least conception how the hearts of the twain went out to her at
 this momentary revelation of feeling, and
---
what a complication she was

---
when there would be no lessons to
 give to Sue
---
the next
 day, on looking on the blackboard in Sue's class, Phillotson was
 surprised to find upon it,, a perspective
 view of Jerusalem,.


---
"," said she," but
---
I remembered that much of it."


---
Her Majesty's school- inspector was at that time; and
---
But Sue's class was at the further end of the room, and
---
her back was
 towards the entrance
---
her teaching some half- minute
---
before she became aware
 of his presence
---
She turned, and. 
---
The effect upon her timidity was such. 
---
that she uttered a
 cry of fright
---
She soon recovered herself, and but
---
she was
 so white that Phillotson took her into his room, and gave her some
 brandy to bring her round. 
---
She found.


---
to have told me," she gasped petulantly,"! 
---
Oh, what shall I do! 
---
that I am no good
---
I shall be

---
that she was moved, and
---
that she
 had upbraided him
---
When she was better
---
she went home.


---
Sue would like
---
The
 latter was holding the umbrella over her head, and
---
whereupon she gently removed it; but
---
she let. 
---
She did
 not look absolutely behind her, and
---
till they had reached Sue's cottage and
---
she had passed in
---
VI


 Jude's old and embittered aunt lay unwell at Marygreen, and
---
His aunt was now unable to leave her bed, and
---
with the
 proceeds of this and her savings she was comfortably supplied with
 necessaries and more, a widow of the same village living with her and
 ministering to her wants. 
---
" She was-- in this room. 
---
" Oh-- I wanted."


---
" Now you've been seeing her!"
---
said the harsh old woman. 
---
" And what
 did I tell' ee?"


---
" Well-- that I was not."


---
" Have you gossiped with her?"


---
She was brought up by her father; and
---
she'll look with no favour upon a working chap
 like you-- a townish girl as she's become by now. 
---
I never cared much
 about her. 
---
, that's, with
 her tight- strained nerves. 
---
what she was too often
---
Many's the time I've smacked her for her
 impertinence. 
---
when she was walking into the pond with
 her shoes and stockings off
---
her petticoats pulled above her
 knees,
---
I could cry out for shame
---
Why, one day, and afore, she said:'!

---
" She was a little child then."


---
" She was twelve if a day."


---
But now she's older
---
she's of a thoughtful,
 quivering, tender nature, and
---
" Do n't you be a fool
 about her!"


---
But she's gone to
 the other side of the world, and
---
If she's
 townish and wanton
---
she began a commentary on past years,
---
She described what an odd little
 maid Sue had been when a pupil at the village school across the green
 opposite, before her father went to London-- how, when the vicar
 arranged readings and recitations, she appeared on the platform, the
 smallest of them all," in her little white frock, and shoes, and pink
 sash"; how she recited" Excelsior,"" There was a sound of revelry by
 night," and" The Raven"; how during the delivery she would knit her
 little brows and glare round tragically, and say to the empty air, as
 if some real creature stood there--


   " Ghastly, grim, and ancient Raven,
       wandering from the Nightly shore,
    Tell me what thy lordly name is
       on the Night's Plutonian shore!"



---
" She'd bring up the nasty carrion bird that clear,,. 
---
as she stood there in her little sash and
 things
---
The neighbour told also of Sue's accomplishments in other kinds:


---
" She was not exactly a tomboy,; but
---
she could do things that
 only boys do, as a rule. 
---
I've seen her hit in and steer down the
 long slide on yonder pond, with her little curls blowing, one of
 a file of twenty moving along against the sky like shapes painted
 on glass, and up the back slide without stopping. 
---
All boys except
 herself; and then they'd cheer her, and
---
then she'd say,'. 
---
These retrospective visions of Sue only made Jude the more miserable
 that he was unable to woo her, and
---
in which Sue's little figure had so glorified
 itself
---
When I was there once for an hour
---
" I did n't see much in it for my
 part;
---
As I say
---
, I did n't see
 nothing of it the hour or two
---
I was there
---
; so I went in and. 
---
, I suppose?
---
After all, she had only known
 a little part of the miserable struggle in which he had been engaged
 thus unequipped, poor, and unforeseeing.


---
But the schoolmaster had been since
 blest with the consolation of sweet Sue,.


---
She laid it down
---
the maid stood
 still,. 
---
She must have recognized his voice,
---
Sue appeared with a candle in her hand.


---
With supporting him, she led him indoors, and. 
---
She asked him, but
---
that she would come down early
 in the morning and
---
Then telling him to go to sleep, and get him some breakfast, she bade him good- night
 and.


---
She knew the worst of him-- the very worst. 
---
She would soon be coming down,, and
---
as she had said
---
on which she had hung
 it
---
, attended by the woman who lived with her
---
" My aunt has mentioned
 you more than once. 
---
For there was no other girl, O bridegroom,
     like her!"--SAPPHO( H. T. Wharton).



---
was created
 by a letter from Sue,. 
---
She evidently
 wrote with anxiety, and. 
---
more
 than that she had passed some sort of examination for a Queen's
 Scholarship, and
---
she had chosen
---
while at the same time Sue was
---
Sue had gone to the Melchester
 Normal School. 
---
She had acquiesced so readily--
---
she evidently did not much care about him, his silent disappearance. 
---
though she
 had never once reproached him for his strange conduct in coming to
 her that night, and
---
Neither had she ever

---
Suddenly, however, quite a passionate letter arrived from Sue.

---
She was quite lonely and miserable
---
, she told him. 
---
She hated the
 place she was in
---
She felt utterly friendless
---
though she would only be able to
 see him at limited times, the rules of the establishment she found
 herself in being strict to a degree. 
---
who had
 advised her
---
she wished.


---
she had never listened to
 him
---
She was
 here-- actually in this Close-- in one of the houses confronting this
 very west façade.


---
in a few
 minutes she came.


---
Though she had been here such a short while
---
, she was not. 
---
All her bounding manner was gone
---
; her curves of
 motion had become subdued lines. 
---
Yet neither was she quite the
 woman who had written the letter that summoned him. 
---
She wore a murrey- coloured gown with a little lace collar. 
---
which formerly she had worn
---
Her hair, according to the
 custom of the day was now twisted up tightly, and
---
she had altogether
 the air of a woman clipped and pruned by severe discipline,
 an under- brightness shining through from the depths which that
 discipline had not yet been able to reach.


---
She had come forward prettily, but
---
that she had hardly
 expected
---
Sue came out into the town with him, and
---
then she confessed,
 with something of shame,. 
---
that she was dreadfully hungry
---
a dinner, tea, and
 supper all in one was the present she most desired in the world.

---
She told him about the school, and
---
the rough
 living, and the mixed character of her fellow- students, gathered
 together from all parts of the diocese, and. 
---
she had
---
what she did not tell
---
; she looked up
 and.


---
as if they were the
 fingers of a glove she was purchasing
---
as I
 was" Oh, I have tried not to!  I hope I shall never have any doubt of your worthiness,
 And I am glad you have come!"

" she said.


---
" I do n't dislike it,. 
---
I think... 
---
Well, I'm rather glad I came
 to this training- school, after all. 
---
how independent I shall be
 after the two years' training
---
I shall pass pretty high
---
, I expect,
 and
---
She had touched the subject at last. 
---
" I had a suspicion, a fear,"

---
Her ever- sensitive lip began, and
---
her eye to blink, at
 something.


---
her to say
---
said she, with the perverseness that was
 part of her. 
---
what I have done
---
I have promised--
---
I
 have promised--
---
that I will marry him, and
---
when I come out of the
 training- school two years hence
---
Sue regarded him
 passively without moving.


---
" I knew!"
---
she said with an air of no emotion
 whatever. 
---
" Very well-- I am wrong
---
, I suppose! 
---
I ought
---
as she
 probably knew, and
---
She was something of a riddle to him, and
---
," she answered, a remnant of vexation still in her voice.

---
as I
 have done these last few years
---
I am not
 modern, either. 
---
I am more ancient than mediæ valism,."


---
" There-- I wo n't say any more of that!
---
" she cried. 
---
how bad I am
---
I was
---
, then I must go in, or."


---
I shall be

---
Her reproach had taken that shape, then, and not the shape of words.

---
that it was presented to the same
 serious- minded woman by her fellow- servants on the occasion of her
 marriage
---
" I have leave from three till nine. 
---
I do n't care for them."


---
I hate Gothic!"


---
There duly came the charm of calling at the college door for her
---
Nobody stared at Sue,. 
---
because
 she was,
---
which had no connection
 with her real life or her real self
---
"" said she.


---
Sue paused patiently beside
 him, and
---
When she had thoroughly estimated him at this
---
, she would move on and

---
that her
 cousin deeply interested her,
---
who was
 inclined for any adventure that would intensify the sense of her
 day's freedom
---
which made her look like a
 shepherdess
---
during the next half- mile
 Sue seemed, and
---
admitted by an old woman
 without a single tooth, to whom they were as civil as strangers can
 be when their only chance of rest and shelter lies in the favour of
 the householder
---
Well then, she can go into

---
Mother's room, and you and I can lie in the outer chimmer. 
---
" I rather like this," said Sue,. 
---
" An urban miss is."


---
She looked severe disagreement, and.


---
in which she was again to

---
walked to the
 Close, and rose before Sue's eyes, she looked a little scared. 
---
she murmured.


---
," she
 said quickly,. 
---
"

" WOULD I!" 
---
She passed
 in,.




---
The seventy young women, of ages varying in the main from nineteen to
 one- and- twenty,,,
 formed a very mixed community, which included the daughters of
 mechanics, curates, surgeons, shopkeepers, farmers, dairy- men,
 soldiers, sailors, and villagers. 
---
that Sue Bridehead had not come in at closing- time
---
" She went out with her young man
---
She'll have it hot when she does come.
---
" She said,
---
to be
 effectual in saving our souls," said the head girl of the year,
 drily.


---
that, only twelve months before, there had occurred
 a lamentable seduction of one of the pupils who had made the same
 statement in order to gain meetings with her lover
---
, Sue's being pronounced three
 times sonorously by Miss Traceley without eliciting an answer.


---
every girl's thought was,? 
---
Where is Sue Bridehead
---
before
 doing so gave a final glance at Sue's cot, which remained empty, and

---
Sue's table had a moderate
 show, two men in their filigree and velvet frames standing together
 beside her looking- glass.


---
" Who are these men-- did she ever say?. 
---
" One-- the middle- aged man," said a student in the next bed--"is the
 schoolmaster she served under-- Mr.
---
She has never told his name."


---
" Was it either of these two who came for her?"


---
till they fell asleep the
 girls indulged in conjectures about Sue, and
---
what games
 she had carried on in London and at Christminster, some of the more restless ones getting out of bed and looking
 from the mullioned windows at the vast west front of the cathedral
 opposite, and the spire rising behind it.


---
before she came
 here
---
they glanced into Sue's nook,
. 
---
When, accordingly, Sue came into the dormitory to hastily tidy
 herself, looking flushed and tired
---
, she went to her cubicle in
 silence,.

---
that she did not follow them
 into the dining- hall to breakfast,
---
that she had
 been severely reprimanded, and
---
A round robin was,
. 
---
Towards evening, dictating her
 subject, the girls in the class sat with folded arms.


---
that the young
 man Bridehead stayed out with
---
that she has no such relative
---
" I may as well tell you. " We are willing to take her word
---
," said the head girl.


---
the mistress left
 the room to inquire from her superiors what was to be done.


---
Presently, towards dusk, the pupils,, heard exclamations
 from the first- year's girls in an adjoining classroom, and
---
that Sue Bridehead had got out of the back window of the
 room in which she had been confined,
---
How she had managed.


---
she was

---
" She must have walked through the river!"
---
" Or drownded herself," said the porter.


---
not so much at the possible
 death of Sue as at the possible half- column detailing that event in
 all the newspapers, would give the college an unenviable notoriety for many months to
.


---
then, at
 last, on the opposite shore,, some
 little boot- tracks were discerned in the mud, which left no doubt
 that the too excitable girl had waded through a depth of water
 reaching nearly to her shoulders--.

---
As Sue had not brought disgrace upon the school by drowning herself
---
that she was gone
---
that contained Sue
---
that she could enter easily enough
---
in a moment she appeared in
 the light of his lamp. 
---
she
 was clammy as a marine deity
---
she said through her chattering teeth. 
---
" Can I come by
 your fire, Jude?"


---
She crossed to his little grate and very little fire, but
---
as the
 water dripped from her
---
as she moved
---
, the idea of drying herself was
 absurd. 
---
She had begun the explanation in her
 usual slightly independent tones, but
---
before she had finished the
 thin pink lips trembled, and
---
she could hardly refrain from crying.


---
her know
---
On two other chairs before the
 fire were her wet garments.
---
She blushed,
 but only for a moment.


---
They are only a woman's
 clothes-- sexless cloth and linen... 
---
She
 gasped a little, but.


---
She then began; but
---
in the middle of her story her voice faltered,

---
her head nodded, and
---
she ceased. 
---
She was in a sound sleep. 
---
lest she should have caught a chill which might
 permanently injure her
---
that a warm flush now rosed
 her hitherto blue cheeks, and
---
that her hanging hand was no
 longer cold
---
When she had descended
---
Suddenly she said," Jude!"


---
Why, I fell asleep
---
, did n't I? 
---
What SHALL I do!
---
" she said,.


---
I want
---
But I do n't know! 
---
" I am going, and. 
---
I have. 
---
I'm
 all right. 
---
Look here, what I have got for you. 
---
When she had sat upright
---
she breathed plaintively and. 
---
I do

---
I thought; and
---
I was well
---
I ought not
---
, ought I?" 
---
But the supper fortified her somewhat, and
---
when she
 had had some tea and
---
had lain back again she was bright and cheerful.


---
for she seemed
 preternaturally wakeful afterwards
---
she said,. 
---
I am a sort of negation of
 it.
---
Do I strike you as being learned?
---
" she asked, with a touch
 of raillery.


---
Only you do n't talk quite like a girl-- well, a
 girl who has had no advantages.
---
" I have had advantages. 
---
I do n't know Latin and Greek,
---
though I know

---
But I know most of the Greek and
 Latin classics through translations, and other books too. 
---
I read
 Lemprière, Catullus, Martial, Juvenal, Lucian, Beaumont and Fletcher,
 Boccaccio, Scarron, De Brantôme, Sterne, De Foe, Smollett, Fielding,
 Shakespeare, the Bible, and other such; and.
---
" Well," she said thoughtfully,". 
---
I have no
 fear of men, as such, nor of their books.
---
I have mixed with them-- one
 or two of them particularly-- almost as one of their own sex. 
---
I mean

---
I have not felt about them
---
as most women are taught
---
unless she invites him
---
Until she says by a look
'
---
I was going
---
when I
 was eighteen
---
that I formed a friendly intimacy with an undergraduate at
 Christminster, and
---
which
 I should never have got hold of otherwise
---
, I suppose?
---
she said, a contralto note of
 tragedy coming suddenly into her silvery voice. 
---
I would n't have

---
if I had known
---
" No, I am not. 
---
" Well, I invested his money, poor fellow, in a bubble scheme, and

---
I lived about London by myself for some time, and
---
then I
 returned to Christminster, as my father-- who was also in London, and
; and
---
I got that occupation in the artist- shop where you found
 me... 
---
"


 said she,
---
that she was
 brimming with tears
---
But I have never yielded myself to any lover,
! 
---
I have remained.
---
as I began
---
" I quite believe you. 
---
But some women would not have remained.
---
Better women would not. 
---
I must be

---
But I wo n't have it!

---
I have never made any secret of it to anybody.
---
I was everything to him,

---
whatever I did
---
; she seemed.


---
she suddenly asked, in
. 
---
a voice of such extraordinary tenderness come from the same woman who had just told her story so lightly
---
" I
 would rather offend anybody in the world than you
---
, I think!
---
" I do n't know whether I am vexed or not. 
---
I know
---
I care very much
 about you!"


---
" I care as much for you as for anybody I ever met."


---
There, I ought. 
---
that she was treating
 him cruelly,
---
Her very
 helplessness seemed.


---
I am awfully ignorant on general matters,
---
although I have worked so
 hard
---
Oh no, no," she answered,".

---
I would rather not,
---
I should seem so-- such a hypocrite."


---
" I thought, so
---
I did n't propose it. 
---
that I hope
---
" To be ordained, I think?
---
she turned her face away.


---
" Well, I can do without what it confers.  I care for something
 higher." And I for something broader, truer," she insisted. 
---
that whenever to speak of the schoolmaster she
 turned the conversation to some generalizations about the offending
 university
---
e_ and betrothed; yet she would not enlighten
 him.


---
she murmured.


---
" she added,
.
"
---
she replied, in the tone of a child who was going to be good for ever
 after, turning her back upon him accordingly
---
she
 took it up, and.


---
" Jude," she said brightly,
---
come back to her;
" will you let?"


---
" I altered my old one by cutting up all the Epistles and Gospels into
 separate_ brochures_, and rearranging them in chronological order as
 written, beginning the book with Thessalonians, following on with the
 Epistles, and. 
---
Then I had the
 volume rebound. 
---
she said,
---
as she glanced
 into the pages of Solomon's Song
---
" I mean the synopsis at the head
 of each chapter,.

---
Then I wo n't say any more, except that people have no
 right to falsify the Bible! 
---
I HATE such hum- bug!" 
---
" I WISH; but
---
I had a friend here to support me
---
" But my dear Sue, my very dear Sue, I am not against you!"
---
her introducing personal feeling
 into mere argument
---
she cried,. 
---
YOU are fairest among women to me,!"


---
Sue replied,. 
---
her voice changing
 to its softest note of severity
---
" I wo n't disturb your convictions--
---
I really wo n't!
---
she went on
 soothingly,
---
when I saw you,
 and
---
I-- shall I confess it?--
---
" Well, dear; I suppose. 
---
I take Christianity."


---
" Indeed I might. 
---
Perhaps I have done so!" 
---
" I wo n't ask what,
---
She
 looked up trustfully, and
---
her voice seemed.


---
" I shall always care for you!"
---
Because you are single- hearted, and forgiving to
 your faulty and tiresome little Sue!"


---
But Sue was so
 dear!... 
---
as she
 seemed
---
to be able to do so easily of his, what a comrade she would
 make
---
She
 was nearer to him than any other woman he had ever met, and
---
till she
 fell asleep again
---
that her clothes were dry
---
she still slept on inside his great- coat,. 
---
she was dressed as usual
---
she asked. 
---
" Oh, I do n't want any! 
---
I fear! 
---
I ought
---
I do n't know
---
I hope; but
---
, I expect!
---
" I'll go to him and explain--
---
I do n't care for him! 
---
-- I shall do!"


---
just as I choose
---
if I did
---
said--"

" Well,, I shall do for all him! 
---
as I like
---
I have thought of
 what I shall do--
---
She has a school
 near Shaston, about eighteen miles from here-- and
---
Sue still
 seemed sorry for her rashness, and. 
---
she had not rebelled
---
that she would let
---
" Jude," she said. 
---
" I know one of them. 
---
she vanished away
---
The next morning there came a letter from her,
 which, with her usual promptitude
---
, she had written directly
---
she had
 reached her friend's house. 
---
She told him of her safe arrival and
 comfortable quarters, and then added:--


    What I really write about
---
that I felt, and
---
I was
---
I do n't
    mind at all; and
---
I'll never say again!

   
---
Now I wo n't write any more about that. 
---
You do forgive your
    thoughtless friend for her cruelty? and
---
that she would
 write again
---
that she was ill from her
 immersion
---
A little girl opened the door. 
---
" Miss Bridehead is up- stairs
---
," she
 said. 
---
" And will you please walk up to her?
---
" Is she ill?
---
she answered. 
---
" I did catch a bad cold-- but
---
I
 could have written. 
---
Only I would n't!"


---
what I was afraid of
---
But I had decided. 
---
why I
 could n't write
---
She did not answer directly. 
---
" I vowed
---
I never would tell you,

---
and I ought!... 
---
There-- now I have told you, and
---
I wish!"


---
I had n't
---
" I do n't think of you! 
---
I do
---
I had n't begun to. 
---
I HAVE
 recognized. 
---
if I had reckoned upon marrying you
---
I should n't have come to you so
 often! 
---
And I never supposed
---
when I began
---
Perhaps I ought. 
---
I was so blind at first!"
---
she went on. 
---
" I did n't see. 
---
I'll never trust you again!"


---
She turned her eyes doubtfully towards him, and.


---
she might forgive him
---
" Yes," she said shortly,. "
---
her face changing a little
---
Though I
 did n't ask him. 
---
But I should n't care!"


---
It was very perplexing to her lover. 
---
that she should be piqued at his
 honest acquiescence in his rival,
---
she said decisively.


---
Sue's kind hostess now returned from church, and
---
that she was rather unreasonable,
---
Then, in illustration of what to discern as one of her
 redeeming characteristics there came promptly a note, which she must
 have written almost immediately he had gone from her:


    Forgive me for my petulance yesterday! 
---
I was horrid to
    you
---
; I know it, and
---
I feel perfectly miserable at my
    horridness. 
---
I'll try.

   
---
I am coming to Melchester on Saturday,,&
---
I could walk with you for half
    an hour,?--
---
when she came
---
if she chose
---
since she would not marry him offhand
---
About the time,
 and entering on adventures at the latter place with Sue, the
 schoolmaster was settling down in the new school- house at Shaston.

---
In one of
 them-- quite a recent note-- the young woman said, and
---
that she had received
 his considerate letter
---
than she desired
---
who loved her
---
which just disclosed,
 too, the thoughtfulness that lay behind her lighter moods
---
Sue had, in fact, never written a line to her suitor on the subject,
. 
---
Sue, as she
 had promised
---
her escaping
 from the training school
---
her coming to me?"


---
that Sue had irretrievably committed herself with him. 
---
which
 led to her rustication
---
no Sue
 appeared. 
---
Speedily overtaking her
---
she had
 promised.


---
," she said--
---
Finding her to be in this evasive mood give her the information so long withheld.


---
" I have not. 
---
But I am not going; and

---
I wo n't answer!"


---
" said she,
---
I feel just the same about
 you, Jude. 
---
I seem such a coldhearted--"


---
As she knew his sentiment towards her Jude
---
she continued:"!"


---
I did n't mind
---
:" I have never told you--"

".


---
I mean
---
", I have never told you my history-- all of it."


---
" But I guess it. 
---
I know nearly."


---
Could she possibly know of that morning performance
 of his with Arabella; which in a few months had ceased to be a
 marriage more completely than by death? 
---
that she did not
---
" I ca n't quite tell you here in the street
---
which merely led up to the
 information that he had married a wife some years earlier, and
---
that
 his wife was living still
---
Almost before her countenance had time to
 change
---
she hurried out the words,

" Why did n't you tell me before!"


---
" I could n't.
---
she withdrew it. 
---
She was his comrade,
 friend, unconscious sweetheart no longer; and
---
I was ashamed of the episode in my life which brought about the
 marriage
---
" I ca n't explain it precisely now. 
---
I could
 have done it!"


---
she burst out. 
---
" Here I have been saying, or
 writing, that--
---
she said,.


---
I never thought,
 till quite lately
---
; so I felt! 
---
how I mean
---
I do n't like' out of charity' at all!"


---
It was a question which in the circumstances Sue did not choose to
 answer.


---
" I suppose?".


---
she-- your wife-- is-- a very pretty woman,
---
even if she's
 wicked
---
she asked quickly
---
" She's pretty enough, as far as that goes."


---
than I am
---
And I have never seen her for
 years... 
---
But she's sure to come back
---
" How strange of you to stay apart from her like this!" said Sue,
 her trembling lip and lumpy throat belying her irony. 
---
When she saw and
---
she softened
---
trying to blink
 away her sympathetic tears said with all the winning reproachfulness
 of a heart- hurt woman:"! 
---
once Sue was as miserable as he, in her attempts to keep herself free
 from emotion, and her less than half- success.


---
she said,. 
---
she showed. 
---
herself recovered
---
she
 appeared anyhow
---
as she did appear
---
" I do n't blame you for what you could n't help.

---
," she said,
---
" How should I be so foolish? 
---
I do blame you a little bit for not
 telling me before. 
---
that I must have loved you, and
---
wanted to be your
 wife,," said Sue, with a gentle
 seriousness which did not reveal her mind. 
---
And-- I am engaged to somebody
 else. 
---
Her being able to talk learnedly
---
that she was mistress of
 herself again
---
she had almost regained her
 vivacious glance, her reciprocity of tone, her gay manner, and her
 second- thought attitude of critical largeness towards others of her
 age and sex.


---
She said."


---
she said with nervous
 lightness. 
---
I have something to tell you which perhaps
    you will not be surprised to hear, though certainly it may
    strike you as being accelerated( as the railway companies
    say of their trains).
---
till I had gone through my course of training
    and
---
now I am not at the training
    school. 
---
I say
---
And yet, what
 could the poor girl do?
---
Sue was not a very practical or calculating person;
 and
---
Sue had, in fact, been
 placed in an awkward corner. 
---
If Sue had written
---
Sue also thanked him. 
---
who had been one cause of Sue's unpleasant
 experience as for the sake of room
---
Then Sue wrote; and
---
that she should come into residence on the

---
She arrived by the ten o'clock train on the day aforesaid,
---
to meet her at the station, by her special request pay, she said(). 
---
if this were
 her true reason
---
She lived in the same house with him, but
---
an occasional supper being the only meal
 they took together, when Sue's manner was something like that of a
 scared child
---
What she felt
---
though she did not look pale or ill
---
On the morning of the
 wedding,, Sue and her cousin
 had breakfast together for the first and last time during this
 curious interval; in his room-- the parlour-- which he had hired for
 the period of Sue's residence. 
---
as women do
---
, she bustled about.


---
" she said suddenly.


---
She talked incessantly,. 
---
as if she dreaded his indulgence in
 reflection, and
---
she wished, and
---
By the irony of fate, and the
 curious trick in Sue's nature of tempting Providence at critical
 times, she took his arm-- a
 thing she had never done before in her life-- and
---
Indeed!" she exclaimed with curiosity. 
---
She does not realize
---
Sue still held Jude's arm,. 
---
almost as if she
 loved him
---
Cruelly sweet, indeed, she had been to him that morning;
 but
---
to do things like this," she said in the delicate voice of an
 epicure in emotions, which left no doubt that she spoke the truth.


---
I know
---
she said regretfully,. 
---
as she blinked away an
 access of eye moisture
---
" And I promised!... 
---
I
 suppose. 
---
I ought
---
Oh, I
 ought n't! 
---
I see it now. 
---
I wo n't do it any more!"
---
she continued
 humbly; and
---
Sue intending
---
But the first person was the schoolmaster himself,
 whose train had arrived sooner than Sue expected. 
---
she withdrew her
 hand, and
---
she, smiling candidly
---
she had gone too far.


---
which she accordingly
 did
---
" No," said Sue
---
," I'll go on to the house with him"; and.


---
she departed with the schoolmaster
---
Sue was obvious
---
she could almost be seen.


---
that she was

---
six or seven women and children had gathered by the door
. 
---
," she said. 
---
" I'll take the bonnet
 off."


---
And she obeyed.


---
How could Sue have had the temerity to
 a cruelty possibly to herself as well as to him?

---
Women were different from men in such matters. 
---
Or was Sue simply so perverse
 that she wilfully gave herself and him pain for the odd and mournful
 luxury of practising long- suffering in her own person, and of being
 touched with tender pity for him at having made him practise it? 
---
that her face was nervously set
---
rather, however,, from her knowledge of
 what her cousin must feel,
---
whom she need not have had there at all,
 than from self- consideration
---
Possibly she would go on inflicting
 such pains again and again, and.


---
she looked back
---
In crossing the pavement to the fly;
 and there was a frightened light in her eyes. 
---
that Sue
 had acted with such unusual foolishness
---
she knew
 not what for the sake of asserting her independence of him, of
 retaliating on him for his secrecy? 
---
because she was childishly ignorant of that side of their
 natures which wore out women's hearts and lives
---
When her foot was on the carriage- step she turned round,. 
---
that
 she had forgotten something
---
" No," she said,. 
---
I know."


---
where
 I left it
---
She had found it, and. 
---
She looked into his eyes with her own tearful ones, and
---
her
 lips suddenly parted. 
---
as if she were going
---
But she
 went on; and
---
she had meant.




---
if she had really left her handkerchief behind; or

---
that she had miserably wished
---
that at the last moment she could not bring herself
---
that she would come back
---
She could not
 possibly go home with Phillotson
---
: why should she not come? 
---
But she did not come.


---
she and Phillotson had gone for their holiday
---
It was a new
 beginning of Sue's history. 
---
see
 her child-- hers solely-- there would be comfort in it!"
---
There was every possibility of her
 lingering on for weeks or months, though little likelihood. 
---
if she could come by the up- train which crossed his
 down- train at that station
---
she had occupied when, leaning over her ecclesiastical
 scrolls, a hog- hair brush in her hand
---
as if she were dead
---
nobody had been
 found capable of succeeding her in that artistic pursuit. 
---
when she turned her face for a moment to the glass
---
If she had come on to his compartment
---
she would have seen him.

---
But she did not
---
, this being presided over by the maiden on the other
 side. 
---
Abby was in a black gown, with white linen cuffs and a broad
 white collar, and her figure, more developed than formerly, was
 accentuated by a bunch of daffodils that she wore on her left bosom.

---
In the compartment she served.


---
" she cried gaily. 
---
She served the liqueur from one of the lovely bottles and
---
" Not a sound," said she.


---
" I left him in Australia; and
---
I suppose."


---
I'll romantically vanish up the
 street of this picturesque city."


---
She handed the change over the counter, in taking which he caught her
 fingers and held them. 
---
Arabella now seemed. 
---
that she served
---
Arabella did not recognize him for a moment. 
---
She started; till a humorous impudence sparkled in her eyes, and she
 spoke.


---
" Well, I'm blest! 
---
I thought!"


---
" I never heard anything of you, or
---
I do n't know. 
---
that I should
 have come here
---
What shall I treat you to this
 afternoon? 
---
She idly allowed. 
---
her fingers to rest on the
 pull of the beer- engine
---
as she inspected him critically
---
that her hands were smaller and whiter than when he had lived with
 her, and
---
that on the hand she wore an
 ornamental ring set with what seemed to be real sapphires-- which they
 were, indeed, and were much admired as such by the young men who
 frequented the bar
---
" I do n't care to go into them," she replied evasively. 
---
" I make a
 very good living, and
---
I do n't know."


---
that I want your company
---
Arabella was

---
"," she said,
. 
---
I can get off duty two hours sooner than usual,. 
---
if
 I ask
---
I am not living in the house at present.
---
I'll come back
---
I suppose we'd
 better arrange something.
---
I'm not going!"


---
" But I must know a thing or two; and,
---
Very well; I'll call for you."


---
Though Arabella's word was absolutely
 untrustworthy
---
the woman between whom and himself there was no more unity than
 between east and west,.


---
Having to meet Arabella here, it was impossible. 
---
Arabella was perhaps an intended intervention to punish him for his
 unauthorized love. 
---
each having a pink
 flush on her cheek
---
that she would find him outside the door
---
when she came away
---
," she said with great
 good humour. 
---
" Just an early night- cap: I always do. 
---
She drew a couple of liqueur glasses of brandy; and

---
though she had evidently, from her countenance
---
she had breathed for so many hours
---
, she finished hers
 quickly
---
In a few minutes she came, in a thick jacket and a hat with a black
 feather. 
---
" I live quite near and. 
---
," she said,,"
---
My aunt is on her deathbed
---
She speedily returned, and
---
Having, like Jude, made rather a
 hasty toilet to catch the train, Arabella looked a little frowsy,
 and
---
her face was very far from possessing the animation which had
 characterized it at the bar the night before. 
---
When they came out of
 the station she found that she still had half an hour to spare before

---
she was due at the bar. 
---
" What?" said she.


---
" Well, I think. 
---
as I have

---
And as I said, I sha n't ask for
 the day to go with you to see your aunt.  I'd sooner not walk up Chief Street with you," So I had-- two things-- one in particular.  I'll tell you now?  As an honest
 woman I wish...  It was."

---
Arabella spoke somewhat hurriedly for her. 
---
her disappear in the direction of
 the hotel
---
than Sue stood

---
To his great surprise no other like a vision before him-- her look bodeful and anxious as in a dream,
 her little mouth nervous, and her strained eyes speaking reproachful
 inquiry.


---
she said in quick,
 uneven accents not far from a sob. 
---
Then she flushed as she observed
 his thought that they had not met since her marriage.


---
till she glanced at him with furtive solicitude
---
" I arrived at
 Alfredston station last night,, and
---
Aunt was a trifle better
---
I am so glad-- to meet you like this!" But I reached Marygreen alone, and I sat up with her, and I was-- I thought And this, I thought, was!"


---
" I thought I would come by the morning train and" I did think of my promise to you, dear, continually!  I shall never
 break out again as I did, I am sure.  I may have been doing nothing
 better, but I was not doing that-- I loathe the thought of it."

" I am glad your staying had nothing to do with that. ," she said,

---
" I didn't
---
-- I am sorry to say. 
---
I had an appointment at nine
 o'clock-- too late for me to catch the train that would have met
 yours, or to get home at all."


---
as she appeared to him now
---
that her spirit could be seen
---
And yet she was Phillotson's. 
---
How she had
 become such
---
how she lived as such
---
how my aunt is by this time
---
Though she knew
---
she did not turn
 to him, but.


---
"," she quickly returned.


---
she entreated.

---
She had asked the question in perfect innocence,.

---
That Sue was not, but. 
---
as she had been
---
Yet she seemed unaltered
---
Sue talked; but
---
that she still kept the conversation
 from herself
---
" O yes," she said. 
---
only I would n't let him. 
---
I felt. 
---
, I knew,
---
Aunt Drusilla was so very eccentric; and
---
that she is hardly conscious
---
I am glad I did not
 ask him."


---
that she was unhappy
---
although she had not been
---
But her rushing away thus from home,,
---
whom she had hardly known in her life
---
She reproached him by a glance.


---
You are dear,
 free Sue Bridehead
---
Sue put on a look of being offended,!"


---
till she answered," Nor has
 husbandom you, so far as I can see
---
my wife and
 I occupied the whole of the time we lived together
---
She looked at it. 
---
She closed her lips in retortive silence, and
---
till she glanced at him
---
that, from some cause or other, in
 taking Phillotson as a husband, Sue felt
---
that she had done
---
she
 ought
---
who
 at sight of them lifted her hands deprecatingly
---
She's downstairs,
!"
---
" Out o' bed she got, and

---
nothing could turn her. 
---
On entering, there indeed by the fireplace sat the old woman, wrapped
 in blankets, and turning upon them a countenance like that of
 Sebastiano's Lazarus. 
---
for she
 said in a hollow voice:


---
I was n't going! 
---
she added,. 
---
as I did
---
most women marry
---
" I do n't meant."


---
" I can mind the man very well. 
---
Sue jumped up and. 
---
" She means well, but."


---
said Sue. 
---
" I do n't
 mind her roughness one bit."


---
what she says
---
" I do n't mean that!"
---
she said hastily. 
---
That I ought
---
"-- perhaps I
 ought!"


---
if she had really been going
---
her aunt took
 rather kindly to Sue,.

---
that not many young women newly
 married would have come so far
---
In the afternoon Sue prepared
---
" I'll go with you to the station,?
---
She would not let him. 
---
for she
 looked at him prohibitively
---
She bent down and.

---
She waved her hand and.


---
" She's right! 
---
there arrived a letter
 from Arabella. 
---
Arabella informed him. 
---
that a few days after their
 parting in the morning at Christminster, she had been surprised by an
 affectionate letter from her Australian husband, formerly manager of
 the hotel in Sydney
---
her to join him in conducting the business, which was likely
 to be a very thriving one
---
where she was
---
as her engagement in Christminster was only temporary
---
, she had

---
She could not help.

---
that
 she belonged to him more than to Jude,, and
---
since she had properly married
 him
---
In thus wishing Jude good- bye she bore him no ill- will, and.




---
that she had a chance of improving her
 circumstances and leading a genteel life
---
even though she had not told him of her
 Sydney husband till afterwards
---
that she liked

---
as her manner was
---
when she said
---
for she was now assistant- teacher in
 her husband's school
---
girls in white
 pinafores over red and blue frocks appeared. 
---
that Sue had gone out into the town at the
 heels of the last scholar
---
the girl sweeping the floor
---
it was still the girl with

---
" Do n't stop," said Sue. 
---
" I like it. 
---
I learnt it. 
---
before I left
 Melchester
---
" I ca n't strum before you! 
---
" Oh well-- I do n't mind."


---
Sue sat down, and
---
She, like him, was and, and
---
evidently
 touched-- to her own surprise-- by the recalled air;
---
when she
 had finished
---
"," she said,,"
---
that I should care
 about that air; because--"


---
" I am not that sort-- quite."


---
" I did n't quite mean that."


---
She played on and; and
---
She uttered a forced little laugh.

---
as she relinquished his quickly
---
" she said. 
---
" I wonder?"


---
" I suppose."


---
," said Sue. 
---
not to live in-- I feel crushed into the earth
 by the weight of so many previous lives. 
---
I'll tell Ada."


---
when she returned,
---
followed by the maiden with
 tea
---
"," she said,.


---
if she talked of
 him to Phillotson
---
"," she went on.

---
which she read clearly,
---
as she always did
---
She regarded him curiously.


---
she coaxed. 
---
her to break off
---
till she suddenly jumped up; and to his
 surprise he saw by the kettle- flame that her face was flushed
---
she said,
---
I
 am very much the reverse of what you say so cruelly-- Oh, Jude, it WAS
 cruel to say that! 
---
Yet I ca n't tell you the truth-- I should shock
 you by letting you know how I give way to my impulses, and how much I
 feel that I should n't have been provided with attractiveness unless
 it were meant to be exercised! 
---
Some women's love of being loved is
 insatiable; and
---
I am sorry my husband is not at home."


---
I perceive
---
, she touched
 his fingers but lightly. 
---
when, with a dissatisfied look, she jumped on a form
 and
---
" she asked.


---
" Oh-- wander about, I suppose. 
---
Perhaps I shall go and.
---
I can talk to you better like this than when you
 were inside... 
---
Now, she seemed.


---
she had
 feared at close quarters
---
I have been thinking
---
"," she continued, still in the tone of one
 brimful of feeling,". 
---
I
 am called Mrs. Richard Phillotson,. 
---
But I am not really Mrs. Richard
 Phillotson, but
---
a woman tossed about, all alone, with aberrant
 passions, and unaccountable antipathies... 
---
She stretched out her hand
 and. 
---
She had said.


---
she lived over the way at Old- Grove
 Place, a house which he soon discovered from her description of its
 antiquity
---
crossed by huge moulded beams only a little way above her head
---
who passed her time here
---
She had opened a rosewood work- box, and.

---
while she pressed it against her
 bosom, and
---
that she had not obscured the windows she came
 forward
---
for her to see

---
She closed the shutters, and
---
Whose photograph was she looking at?
---
she had others
---
whom Sue, with gentle
 irreverence, called his demi- gods
---
However,, woman did. 
---
when she subscribed herself at length thus
---
she was wrong in her view
---
that she is dead
---
" She would n't have knowed' ee. 
---
She lay like a doll wi' glass eyes
---
It was absolutely necessary to
 communicate with Sue,. 
---
Aunt Drusilla is dead,
---
if Sue would come
---
She had not written, and
---
that seemed to
 signify rather that she would come than that she would not. 
---
if she
 had arrived
---
she looked so slender to- day that it seemed
 as if she might be crushed in the intensity of a too passionate
 embrace-- such as it was not for him to give. 
---
Two- thirds of the way
 up her head suddenly took a solicitous poise, and
---
that she
 had at that moment recognized him
---
Her face soon began a pensive
 smile, which lasted till,
---
" she began with nervous quickness,"! 
---
" Dear faithful Sue!" murmured Jude.


---
With the elusiveness of her curious double nature, however, Sue did
 not stand still for any further greeting,. 
---
herself to feel it
---
Drusilla was put
 into the new ground, quite away from her ancestors. 
---
Sue and Jude
 had gone side by side to the grave, and
---
She was
---
" murmured
 Sue.

" Yes. 
---
" She said. 
---
At all events, I do, for one!"


---
Sue was silent. 
---
," she said with a tentative
 tremor,"? 
---
Presently she went on:
---
Would n't the woman, for example, be very
 bad- natured and
---
if she did n't like
---
" I have said so, anyhow, to you."

" Yes, I suppose. ; merely"-- her
 voice undulated,
---
because she had a
 personal feeling against it-- a physical objection-- a fastidiousness,
 or whatever it may be called--
---
although she might respect and
---
Ought she to try to

---
I am merely putting a case. " she contradicted. 
---
" How can a woman be unhappy who
 has only been married eight weeks to a man she chose freely?"

"' Chose freely!'
---
A little laugh of objection came from Sue. 
---
" Very well," she said dubiously. 
---
" I did n't tell him."


---
I would come for
 certain
---
her know
---
Her hand lay on the table, and
---
Sue drew hers
 away.


---
," she said repentantly. 
---
Only I have

---
" But I must tell him."


---
I have no feelings of love left in me."


---
" I've seen Arabella."


---
She winced at the hit
---
When did you see her
---
" When I was at Christminster."


---
" So she's come back; and
---
I suppose?"


---
you will live
 with her now
---
She looked at the window pots with the geraniums and cactuses,
,. 
---
till her eyes began
---
" Why should you be so glad to go back to her if-- if what you used to
 say to me is still true--
---
I mean! 
---
How could your heart go back to Arabella so soon?
---
, I suppose,
---
she said with gentle resentment. 
---
I am not happy
---
" I do n't know. 
---
I do n't wish.
---
If I were unhappy
---
not that
 I should have a right to dislike him! 
---
as I am than
 he
---
she had
---
which she did in a vanquished tone,
---
-- I think. 
---
I must be equally honest with you
---
I want
---
, I do n't like him
---
though I
 like Mr. Phillotson as a friend to-- live with him as a husband!--There, now I have let it out
---
that-- I
 could n't help it,.--
---
although I have been-- pretending
---
I am happy
---
, I suppose!
---
She bent down
 her face upon her hands.


---
" I have only been married a month or two!"
---
she went on, still
. 
---
what a woman shrinks from
---
that-- in the early days of her
 marriage-- she shakes down to with comfortable indifference in half a
 dozen years
---
her face being inaccessible
---
You would have been my
 wife, Sue
---
Instead of replying she rose quickly, and. 
---
she was going to
 walk to her aunt's grave in the churchyard to recover herself,
---
soon she
 sent a little girl, and.


---
she was too tired

---
that Sue was sitting within its walls equally lonely and
 disheartened
---
that Sue was so near at hand
---
a woman looking out of the open
 casement at a window on the ground floor of the adjacent cottage
---
so that she
 was visible down to her waist
---
She let
---
that a married woman in trouble of a kind like mine commits a mortal
 sin in making a man the confidant of it,
---
it happens to lots of
 women,
---
In a moment of impulse she bent over the sill, and. 
---
She shut the casement, and
---
when it was time for her to go
---
The morning after,, the neighbours saw
 her companion and herself disappearing on foot down the hill path
. 
---
she said tearfully
---
Then she had conceded
---
she saw no objection
---
If given
 in the spirit of a cousin and a friend: if in
 the spirit of a lover she could not permit it. 
---
she had said.


---
What Sue
 had said in warmth
---
that the women are
---
her give way to an impulse to act unconventionally,
 if not wrongly
---
She was
---
inclined to call it the latter; for Sue's
 logic was extraordinarily compounded, and but or,.


---
" she jerked out,
. 
---
as she pranced on
---
whose person was disagreeable
 to her
---
Then the slim little wife of a husband, the ethereal, fine- nerved, sensitive girl, quite unfitted by
 temperament and instinct to fulfil the conditions of the matrimonial
 relation with Phillotson, possibly with scarce any man, walked
 fitfully along, and.


---
brought weariness into her eyes by

---
that she was

---
it must be owing to the depressing effect of her
 aunt's death and funeral
---
While ascending to the
 town, seated on the top of the omnibus beside him, she said suddenly
 and with an air of self- chastisement,--
---
I let. 
---
I do n't know
?"


---
She remained in an unusually silent, tense, and restless condition,
 and at last,,. 
---
she was tired
---
Thinking Sue was dozing
---
The heavy, gloomy oak wainscot,," and the
 massive chimney- piece reaching to the ceiling, stood in odd contrast
 to the new and shining brass bedstead, and the new suite of birch
 furniture that he had bought for her, the two styles seeming to nod
 to each other across three centuries upon the shaking floor.


---
this being the way in which he pronounced her name
---
She was not in the bed,-- the
 clothes on her side being flung back. 
---
though she had apparently been there
---
she might have

---
she did not come
---
She was not there,
 even now. 
---
She answered" Yes!" as before, but
---
if she
 had suddenly become deranged
---
She had

---
There being no bedstead she had flung down some rugs and made a
 little nest for herself in the very cramped quarters the closet
 afforded.


---
she sprang out of her lair, great- eyed and
 trembling.


---
she cried excitedly.

---
She looked so pitiful and pleading in her white nightgown against the
 shadowy lumber- hole. 
---
She continued to
 beseech him not to disturb her.


---
she, weeping
---
Eliza will hear.
---
Sue had already gone downstairs. 
---
There was a little nest where she
 had lain, and
---
" What must a woman's
 aversion be!"
---
when it is stronger than her fear of spiders
---
her sitting at the breakfast- table
---
" Richard," she said all at once
---
when I married you
---
" I do n't object."


---
Because I thought
---
I could do nothing else
---
,, I regretted

---
Then I had promised you, and. 
---
as I could n't I became rather reckless and careless
 about the conventions. 
---
how I was turned out of the training school; and this frightened
 me and it seemed then that the one thing I could do would be to let
 the engagement stand. 
---
Of course I, of all people, ought not
---
as so many women are-- and
---
just what I fancied I never did care
 for But I was a coward--" I am bound in honesty that I weighed its probability and
."

" Ah!" she said with pained surprise.


---
" I did n't doubt you."


---
" I took his word."


---
Her eyes had filled. 
---
she said.

---
What is the use of thinking of laws and ordinances" she burst out,
"?"


---
But I meant."

 As I choose Sue continued:".' 
---
She, or he,' his own portion
 of it, choose his plan of life for him,
---
She was beginning to

---
his wife turn and, and
---
, her lips slightly crisped,
---
she changed her position, and
---
She wrote again:


   . 
---
No poor woman
    has ever wished more than I,)
---
At first,, she had seemed
; but
---
the irksomeness of
 their position worked on her temperament, and
---
the fibres of her
 nature seemed strained like harp- strings. 
---
She talked vaguely and

---
her
 flinging up the sash
---
that she meant
---
she had mounted upon the sill and
---
She
 disappeared in the darkness, and
---
She had certainly not broken her neck. 
---
She looked at him with eyes

---
She pressed her side and
---
Beyond a scraped elbow and a blow in the side she had apparently
 incurred little harm.


---
she began
---
she was silent.


---
Her cloak was hanging at the back of the door, and
---
it round her
---
The aspect of things was not improved by her admission. 
---
She ascended
 the staircase slowly, the waving light of the candle shining on her.

---
her enter her room
---
Where Stour receives her strength,
    From six cleere fountains fed,[ Drayton.]



---
that she is not so much
---
her to agree
 to a long engagement
---
before she well knew her own mind
---
she saw somebody else, but
---
she blindly fulfilled her engagement."


---
She is one of the oddest creatures I ever met. 
---
And with her unconquerable aversion to myself as a husband, even
 though she may like me as a friend,' tis too much to bear longer.

---
She has conscientiously struggled against it, but to no purpose.

---
-- she has
 read
---
Her intellect sparkles like diamonds,
 while mine smoulders like brown paper... 
---
She's one too many for me!
---
" She'll get over it, good- now?"

" Never! 
---
-- there are reasons why she
 never will. 
---
if she might leave
 me and
---
my
 entering her room by accident
---
when, owing to, she jumped out of window
---
so strong
 was her dread of me! 
---
She pretended, but
---
when a woman jumps out of window without caring

---
whether she breaks her neck or no
---
Now, she's; and
---
her go
---
" Whom with is her matter. 
---
her go
---
that she was puzzling and peculiar
---
" I am quite amazed, that such a sedate,
 plodding fellow as you should have entertained such a craze for a
 moment.  when I called I think!"

" Have you ever stood before a woman whom you know to be intrinsically
 a good woman,--
---
while she has pleaded for release
---
she has

---
that
 merely taking a woman to church and putting a ring upon her finger
 could by any possibility involve one in such a daily, continuous
 tragedy as that now shared by her and me
---
she kept to herself. 
---
, she would rather endure her
 present misery
---
that is a question for herself. 
---
However, she has not distinctly implied,
---
she means to... 
---
why the woman and the children should not be the unit without the
 man
---
Does SHE say all this too?"


---
She little thinks!"


---
that she's a charming young thing
---
she ought,
---
as she glided into the parlour to tea
---
Her nervous
 manner, begotten of a fear lest he should be injured by her course
---
She took the slice
---
" So that being without a wife will
 not really be irksome to me,
---
she said with
 amenable gentleness. 
---
" I should much like."


---
No, I think,
---
" Oh, of course, Richard, I could n't think of having any of your money
 to go away from you with! 
---
I do n't want any either. 
---
I have enough of
 my own, and
---
" I would rather not know anything about him,.

---
But I'll just say. 
---
that I have packed only a change or
 two of my own personal clothing, and one or two little things besides
 that are my very own
---
I wish. 
---
Besides that I have only a small parcel that will go into
 Jude's portmanteau.
---
" Of course I shall do no such thing! 
---
I wish
. 
---
I do n't
 want. 
---
I have a sort of affection for a little
 of it that belonged to my poor mother and father. 
---
" That I shall never do."


---
" I like you much for how you have behaved. 
---
that directly I have begun, but as
 my old teacher, I like you. 
---
I love
 you
---
I do n't
---
Sue was for a few moments a little tearful at these reflections, and

---
her things put on the top,
---
which she quite
 understood and
---
that she was going for

---
" I could make;. 
---
I walked in, and

---
I said I would call I am.""

" She is quite well. 
---
She is gone--
---
That's her tea- cup,
. 
---
that she drank out of only an hour ago
---
she is?"


---
She is,,. 
---
she has my full consent to."


---
" Yes...  I would have died for her; but I would n't be cruel to her
 in the name of the law.  as I understand What they are going to do I can not say. " Shall I-- leave you?" Would you help me?"


---
that she had left behind, and
---
" She
 would n't take all I wanted her to
---
V


 Four- and- twenty hours before this time Sue had written the following
 note to Jude:


   
---
As she was carried by the omnibus farther and farther down from
 the mountain town-- the single passenger that evening
---
-- she regarded
 the receding road with a sad face. 
---
by which she was departing
---
that such a powerful organization as a railway
 train should be brought to a stand- still on purpose for her-- a
 fugitive from her lawful home
---
Sue began
. 
---
she beheld Jude. 
---
She clasped his hand with both hers, and
---
her tense state
 caused. 
---
her to simmer over in a little succession of dry sobs
---
," she repeated.


---
said she,
. 
---
But she
 recovered her equanimity by the time they had travelled a dozen
 miles.


---
" she resumed. 
---
I found on my dressing- table,.
---
to suddenly
 love him,,"
 she answered. 
---
" But I am so cold, or devoid of gratitude, or
 so something,;."


---
although I do feel I
 like his large- mindedness, and
---
" That I NEVER would have done."


---
" Arabella
 has actually written
---
to ask me to get a divorce from her-- in kindness
 to her, she says. 
---
She wants; and."


---
she has already married virtually
---
Perhaps she's no worse than I am, after all!

---
If she wants."


---
" she asked, with the discontinuity to- night.


---
She looked at him. 
---
Sue bent her forehead against the
 corner of the compartment. 
---
she put her

---
she said,.


---
I am something more than a mere-- selfish fellow
---
, I hope. 
---
Much as, under your teaching, I hate convention
---
, I hope!"


---
" Put it down to my
 timidity," she said with hurried evasiveness;" to a woman's natural
 timidity when the crisis comes. 
---
I may feel as well as you. 
---
that I
 have a perfect right to live with you as you thought-- from this
 moment
---
I may hold the opinion that, in a proper state of society,
 the father of a woman's child will be as much a private matter of
 hers as the cut of her underlinen, on whom nobody will have any
 right to question her. 
---
that I am now free
---
But partly, perhaps,, I would rather not be other than a
 little rigid. 
---
I may have acted
 otherwise. 
---
that
 I have n't the courage of my opinions
---
I know. 
---
I am a poor miserable
 creature
---
" I thought--. 
---
what I naturally thought
---
, I am sure. 
---
I make only one condition-- that you are tender and kind to her
---
I
 know. 
---
you love her
---
You were all along' the shadowy third' in my short life with
 her. 
---
I repeat
---
she said with latent tears. 
---
she added,"! 
---
I never was so near being in love with him
. 
---
Yet I was not. 
---
If I
 loved him ever so little as a wife
---
, I'd go back to him even now.
---
Sue, sometimes, when I am vexed with you, I think."


---
she said, and. 
---
as she could, looked severely out into the darkness
---
She
 added in hurt tones, without turning round:". 
---
My liking for you is
 not as some women's perhaps
---
I do n't want
---
I quite realized. 
---
as me with you, I resolved to

---
I'll be content!"


---
" I've let, and
---
of which she had told him-- of the poor
 Christminster graduate whom she had handled thus
---
-- I wo n't let you!"
---
she coaxed,. 
---
I
 did n't dislike you to
---
, I own it, Jude. 
---
Only I do n't want
---
when she pleaded()
---
as she well knew
---
till she aroused herself at
 some thought
---
" I ca n't possibly go to that Temperance Inn, after your telegraphing
 that message!"


---
I have

---
I know
---
But I have n't the courage of my views,. 
---
But sometimes a woman's LOVE OF BEING LOVED gets the better of her
 conscience, and
---
though she is agonized at the thought of treating a
 man cruelly
---
, she encourages him. 
---
while she does n't love
 him at all
---
when she sees
---
she does."


---
what she can
---
that she was distressed and tearful at his criticisms,
 and
---
" I am very bad and unprincipled I know" she said,
.


---
" I think and"


---
you are my dear Sue
---
Though so sophisticated in many things, she was such a child in others
, and
---
that this satisfied her
---
As she would not go
 to the Temperance Hotel because of the form of his telegram
---
During Jude's temporary absence the waiting- maid spoke to Sue.


---
I think,
---
" ma'am, I remember your relation, or friend, or whatever he
 is, coming here once before-- late, just like this, with his wife-- a
 lady, at any rate,
---
said Sue, with a certain sickness of heart. 
---
" Though I
 think! 
---
she said to him plaintively, at their parting
 that night upon the landing,"
---
I do n't like it here--
---
I ca n't bear the place!

---
And I do n't like you so well as I did!"


---
" You were lately here with Arabella. 
---
" The day before I met you in Christminster,.  I told you I had met her."

" Yes, you said, but
---
you had met her
---
not that you had made it up with
 her
---
She was. 
---
, she was, after all, my legal wife,
---
if not--"

 Slipping down on her knees
---
" But Sue Sue buried her face in the bed and.


---
" But you must have thought much of her! 
---
-- women never do! 
---
she pouted provokingly
---
that she had never been really your wife since

---
she left you of her own accord years and years ago! 
---
She has married another man-- really
 married him! 
---
And it is evidently a prick of conscience in her that has led
 her to urge me to get a divorce,. 
---
that she may remarry this man
 legally
---
when you saw her
---
said
 Sue more gently, as she rose.


---
" I did not. 
---
Considering all things, I do n't think!"


---
" I am not. 
---
But I sha n't go to the Temperance Hotel!"


---
she solicited,. 
---
She put the tip of her finger gingerly to her cheek; and
---
they were glad to have her settle among them
---
Her place as monitor in the school was taken by
 another young woman within a few days of her vacating it, which
 substitution also passed without remark,. 
---
Sue's services having been
 of a provisional nature only
---
that Sue had played
 him false and
---
that your wife's going
 away
---
" She has gone?"


---
" She has gone away under circumstances that usually call for
 condolence with the husband. 
---
" She asked
 and
---
I let her. 
---
Why should n't I? 
---
A
 woman of full age, it was a question of her own conscience-- not for
 me. 
---
I was not her gaoler. 
---
I ca n't explain any further. 
---
who was a schoolgirl just out of her standards
---
what money she required, and
---
" She does n't care anything about me!"
---
" Why should
 she?"


---
" She does n't know."


---
" Where are her lover and
---
she living?"


---
She was in light spring clothing, and
---
her advent seemed ghostly-- like
 the flitting in of a moth. 
---
," she said,. 
---
" But I heard-- very ill; and-- and
---
as I know
---
, I have come."


---
" I am not very ill, my dear friend. 
---
" I did n't know that; and
---
I am afraid that only a severe illness would
 have justified my coming!"


---
And I almost wish! 
---
, I suppose?
---
" Only that I am going away from here to another place. 
---
and I do n't agree, and
---
Sue did not for a moment, either now or later, suspect
---
she had received no news whatever from Shaston.

---
as she descended the stairs she lifted her
 eyes and hands in grotesque amazement. 
---
Sue went
 to the window and."


---
But I lose them all,.
---
But I ca n't.
---
" I'll help you to."


---
how I mean
---
She went to where a swing- glass stood, and.


---
" she said. 
---
" And I am
 sure it will cheer you
---
-- I do
---
She spoke with a
 childlike, repentant kindness,.


---
as if she could not do too much for
 him
---
she said quickly. 
---
" I have,
---
I have come
---
when I started
---
; so I must return home almost directly. 
---
Richard,
 I am so very glad you are better. 
---
" I am glad to know you think so
---
she put
 her hand in his or
---
rather allowed; for she was
 significantly light in touch. 
---
She had nearly closed the door!" 
---
She came back.


---
" she said hastily. 
---
She wrote and. 
---
it would be a kindness to her,
---
since
 then she could marry and
---
But I do n't like the sound of it. 
---
I can forgive,
 Sue."


---
I have been so wicked-- as to do
 what I have done!"


---
her
 adopt any line of defence against marital feeling in him
---
" I MUST go
 now. 
---
I'll come again--
---
may I?"


---
" I do n't ask you, even now. 
---
I ask you.
---
" I thank you, Richard; but
---
I must. 
---
as I
 thought
---
, I CANNOT stay!"


---
She's his-- his from lips
---
so faintly
 that in closing the door she did not hear it. 
---
her telling him
 of her, thus far, incomplete relations with Jude
---
" She's been here
---
" No...  She just came,."


---
If she were

---
not your wife--"

" She is not
---
; she's another man's except in name and law. 
---
-- it was suggested to me by a conversation I had with
 her-- that, in kindness to her, I ought to dissolve the legal tie
 altogether; which, singularly enough, I think I can do, now she has
 been back, and refused my request to stay after I said I had forgiven
 her. 
---
her chained on to me? 
---
if she does n't belong to me
---
that she would welcome
---
she
 sympathizes with, and, and even weeps for me, as a husband
 she can not endure me
---
For though as a fellow- creature pities me-- she loathes me
---
-- she loathes me, and my only manly, and dignified, and merciful

---
for her to be independent
---
though she does not know it
---
her go
---
that my liberating her can do her no possible harm, and
---
which she has never dreamt of hitherto
---
Sue and Jude were living in Aldbrickham, in precisely the same
 relations that they had established between themselves when she
 left Shaston to join him the year before. 
---
Sue kept
 house, and.


---
Sue held up a letter she had just
 received.


---
she punished; but
---
nobody took any interest in
 her
---
By degrees Sue acquired her lover's cheerfulness at the sense of
 freedom, and.

---
Sue went up- stairs and.


---
," said Sue, without enthusiasm.


---
" I do n't like; but
---
I feel just the same about
 it now. 
---
as I have done all along
---
I have just the same dread.
---
I do love you,, Sue.
---
" I know it abundantly. 
---
But I think. 
---
I would much rather go on living
 always as lovers,
---
It
 is so much sweeter-- for the woman at least, and
---
when she is sure of
 the man. 
---
,
 I own
---
" Well," she sighed
---
Fewer women like marriage, only they enter into it
 for the dignity it is assumed to confer, and the social advantages
 it gains them sometimes-- a dignity and an advantage that I am quite
 willing to do without."


---
that women are taught by other women
---
Not being men,
 these women do n't know.

who
 was the soul of truth in her conduct

A Nemesis attends the woman who plays the game of
 elusiveness too often, in the utter contempt for her."


---
that, sooner
 or later, her old admirers feel;
---
her to go
 unlamented to her grave
---
Sue regarding the distance had acquired a guilty look; and

---
she suddenly replied in a tragic voice:" Jude!"


---
I do n't think to- day so well as I did,
---
I like you

---
Though I suppose!"


---
I am so
 bad and worthless that I deserve the utmost rigour of lecturing
---
when I want
---
" Oh yes, I am bad, and! 
---
I am not
---
as I
 do
---
that I have nobody but you, and
---
that I must n't have my own way in deciding how I'll
 live with you, and
---
whether I'll be
---
" Sue, my own comrade and sweetheart, I do n't want
---
to force you either
 to marry or to do the other thing-- of course I do n't! 
---
Sue was assisting Jude very
 materially now
---
that her face was
---
She paused a moment. 
---
," she answered.


---
Sue's voice quavered, and
---
as she spoke
---
she suddenly
 sat down from her preparations,. 
---
" I do n't know!"
---
whether I did right or not
---
she
 continued. 
---
when she said
---
she would

---
you might not be able to see her
---
" I said, and when she said she would
 wait, I said I thought."

" Why did you say that, dear? 
---
she wanted a headstone
---
She was n't in mourning, and
---
she did n't want a headstone; and
---
you could n't see her
---
Sue looked critically and imploringly
 at him.


---
I suppose.  I
 thought." " But who was she? 
---
Did n't she say?
---
She would n't give her name. 
---
who she was
---
But I know-- I think I
 do!  It was Arabella!"


---
What should Arabella come for? 
---
it was she?"


---
it was-- by the light in her eyes. 
---
as she looked at me
---
She was a
 fleshy, coarse woman."


---
though she may be getting so by this time under the duties of
 the public house
---
She was rather handsome."


---
But yes!--so she is!"


---
as she is nothing to me, and virtuously married to another man, why
 should she come troubling us
---
" Oh, I can hardly tell.  But I know!  I feel perfectly certain
" Well-- I should not have called Arabella coarse exactly, except in
 speech,.  when I knew her" I think I heard a quiver in your little mouth. " Are you sure she's married? 
---
why she asked me
---
She and the man both wanted.
---
as I
 understood
---
" Oh Jude it WAS Arabella!"
---
cried Sue,. 
---
" And I am so miserable! 
---
whatever she may have come for
---
You could not possibly see her
---
" I do n't really think. 
---
I could
---
It would be so very painful to talk
 to her now-- for her as much as for me. 
---
However, she's gone. 
---
Did she
 say?
---
she would come again
---
But she went away very reluctantly."


---
Sue, whom the least thing upset, could not eat any supper, and
---
Sue instantly emerged from her room,
 which she had but just entered.


---
" There she is again!" 
---
Sue whispered in appalled accents.


---
" She knocked like that last time."


---
I'll open a window
---
The lonely
 street of early retiring workpeople was empty from end to end save of
 one figure-- that of a woman walking up and down by the lamp a few
 yards off.


---
which was
 unmistakably Arabella's
---
" Is it she?
---
," said Arabella humbly.

---
But I called earlier
---
"-- I wanted particularly. 
---
if
 I could
---
I am in trouble, and!"


---
Arabella hesitated. 
---
"," she returned. 
---
Sue remained at gaze, in painful tension,.


---
She was about to give the address, but
---
she
 said,". 
---
I am afraid somebody may hear, so
---
I do n't like
---
where I am staying
 to- night
---
walk
 a little way with me towards the Prince Inn,, I would explain all. 
---
I must do her the kindness of hearing what's the
 matter,
---
I suppose,
---
As she's going
 back to- morrow
---
as she did before
---
She is
 such a low- passioned woman
---
" But she's not your wife!"
---
cried Sue distractedly. 
---
" Oh, but are you going to her? 
---
now she's not your wife any
 more than I!"


---
" Well, she is, rather more than you,
---
she is so anxious to tell me
---
which she knew oppose
---
She said no more, but,. 
---
With a woman's disregard of her dignity when in the
 presence of nobody but herself, she also trotted down,. 
---
articulately as she went
---
She listened. 
---
She knew. 
---
exactly how far
 it was to the inn that Arabella had named as her lodging
---
She looked at the clock. 
---
; she might get; and
---
In a still suspense she waited on. 
---
Sue gave a little ecstatic cry. 
---
" Oh, I knew
---
I could trust you!--how

---
" I ca n't find her anywhere in this street, and
---
I went out in my
 slippers only. 
---
She has walked on,, poor woman. 
---
I've been so hard- hearted

---
I've come back for
 my boots,.
---
why should you take such trouble for a woman who has served
 you so badly!
---
" Oh, but" said Sue in a jealous burst of disappointment.


---
" But, Sue, she's a woman, and
---
I once cared for her; and."

" She is n't your wife any longer!"
---
CAN'T join her, now she's a stranger to you. 
---
" She seems much the same as ever-- an erring, careless, unreflecting
 fellow- creature. 
---
" makes no
 difference in my real relations to her. 
---
If she was my wife
---
while
 she was away in Australia with another husband
---
, she's my wife now.
---
" But she was n't! 
---
She is too low, too coarse
---
It is all very well, and
 the wickedness of coercing a woman. 
---
" Well-- Arabella has appealed to me for help. 
---
" she said,
. 
---
" I have

---
I did n't know you

---
-- I ca n't bear it
---
, I ca n't! 
---
If she were yours it

---
if I must I must
---
, I
 agree! 
---
I will be. 
---
Only I did n't mean to! 
---
And I did n't want to
 marry again, either!... 
---
I agree
---
But, yes--, I agree! 
---
I do love you.

---
I ought!"


---
She ran across and. 
---
" I am not a
 cold- natured, sexless creature,
---
am I, for keeping you at such a
 distance? 
---
I am sure you do n't think so! 
---
I do belong
 to you
---
, do n't I? 
---
I give in!"


---
" And I'll arrange for our marriage to- morrow, or as soon as ever you
 wish."


---
" Then I'll let,
---
her go
---
She is not like you, my darling, and. 
---
Sue absently agreed to banns. 
---
But her mind for the moment was

---
A glow had passed away from her, and

---
depression sat upon her features.


---
she murmured. 
---
she wished! 
---
Perhaps it was really something she was justified in telling
 you. 
---
how she got on
---
she reached the
 inn all right, poor woman
---
" Oh yes: she got on all right
---
she was n't shut out
---
that she had. 
---
if she got in
---
" I hope, and I've been thinking of her all the morning." Well-- is it necessary? 
---
You have n't the least idea how Arabella is
 able to shift for herself. 
---
There was no limit to the strange and unnecessary penances which Sue
 would meekly undertake when in a contrite mood; and
---
whose relation to her was
 precisely of a kind that would have made other people shun them
---
see all sorts of extraordinary persons was
 her instinct ever,.


---
Sue agreed, and. 
---
she had never done
 before
---
she said, a sadness showing in her smile.


---
She walked along the muddy street. 
---
till she reached the public house
 mentioned by Arabella, which was not so very far off
---
She was

---
that Arabella had not yet left,
---
, she sent up word that a friend from Spring Street had called,
 naming the place of Jude's residence. 
---
She was asked. 
---
that it was Arabella's
 bedroom, and
---
She halted on the
 turn of her toe,".


---
till Arabella cried from the bed
---
which Sue accordingly did
---
Arabella lay, and
---
She may have seemed handsome enough in profile under
 the lamps, but
---
the sight
 of her own fresh charms in the looking- glass made Sue's manner
 bright,.


---
till she reflected
---
what a meanly sexual emotion this was in
 her, and
---
" I've just looked in,

---
," she said gently. 
---
" I was afraid afterwards?"


---
I thought
---
as I suppose
---
she had just taken the trouble to
 produce
---
" Indeed," said Sue
---
Oh, I thought,.

---
" I do n't know
---
Sue looked out at the rain, and
---
she had not come
---
Arabella opened it, and
---
as she lay
---
her ruffled look disappeared.


---
blandly when the maid had gone
---
I expect But I do n't want."

" I am much obliged to you for your anxiety about me," she said
;" but This is in answer to one from me." 
---
She held
 out the telegram for Sue to read, but
---
Sue did not take it. 
---
As for you, I should coax Jude, and if I were in your
 place.  I say it as a friend, my dear."," returned Sue, with frigid pride.


---
as woman to woman, for
 there's never
---
I shall marry my
 man over again In my telegram last night which this is an answer
 to, I told him I had almost made it up with Jude; and that frightened
 him, I expect!  Perhaps I should quite have done it," she said;" and
---
if
 a woman seems in trouble
---
as if I had made it up
---
I forgive you. 
---
as I say
---
And,, I'd
 advise you.

---
" I have told you
---
to marry him-- to make our natural
 marriage a legal one," said Sue, with yet more dignity. 
---
" said Arabella,. 
---
," said Sue hastily.


---
" And I, too, must up and off!"
---
that the soft parts of her person shook
---
Sue jumped
 aside in trepidation. 
---
" Lord, I am only a woman-- not a six- foot
 sojer!... ," she continued,. 
---
When Sue reached home Jude
---
She clasped his arm, and
---
that she was
---
," she said at last. 
---
" I wish! 
---
I
 had n't
---
" I hope."


---
she was civil
---
I-- I ca n't help--
---
She's not
 an ungenerous nature; and
---
I am so glad her difficulties have all
 suddenly ended." 
---
She explained,
 and. 
---
how Arabella had been summoned back
---
" I was referring
 to our old question. 
---
What Arabella has been saying to me
---
-- I ca n't bear. 
---
I wish!"


---
I had n't promised
---
I thought."


---
" Indeed, I do n't feel any more anxious now than I did before.

---
Perhaps with any other man I might be a little anxious; but
---
among the
 very few virtues, dear, I think. 
---
I
 may set staunchness
---
So I am not a bit frightened about losing you,

---
now I really am yours and
---
In fact, I am easier
 in my mind,. 
---
than I was
---
I felt.
---
I used
---
I almost expect."


---
while Phryne made complaint that she was tired
 of posing
---
Sue stood back,
. 
---
while her lover went up to the door
---
when she said:" Jude!"


---
" Just let," she said timidly. 
---
" I had such a horrid dream
 one night!... 
---
And Arabella--"

" What did Arabella say to you?"
---
" Oh, she said
---
Her face brightened. 
---
" Yes" said she. 
---
Sue taking his arm and murmuring as they
 walked on homeward:


   
---
as she was dressed
---
as soon she hastened down
---
Sue opened the
 newspaper; Jude the letter. 
---
she held
 across the first page to him with her finger on a paragraph
---
" Look!" said she.


---
the united pair being Arabella and the inn- keeper.


---
," said Sue complacently. 
---
I am glad. 
---
However,
 she is provided for now in a way. 
---
, I suppose, whatever her faults,
 poor thing
---
It is nicer that we are able to think that, than to be
 uneasy about her. 
---
I ought, too,?"


---
my mother and father have lately written to
   
---
Sue's look was one of dismay. 
---
" she asked
 faintly.


---
Sue watched him anxiously, with heavy
 breaths.


---
she says,
---
why she did n't tell me
---
that she said something about having
 a thing on her mind that she would like me to know,
---
Sue replied, and
---
her
 eyes filled.


---
Sue jumped up and. 
---
," she murmured.


---
who held a basket on her lap
---
The woman opened the cover now and
---
With her usual carelessness, she had
 postponed writing to Jude about him till the eve of his landing,
. 
---
when she could absolutely postpone no longer,
---
though she had known
 for weeks of his approaching arrival, and
---
as she truly said
---
on which she had received her
 former husband's answer at some time in the afternoon
---
On his arrival at the Three Horns, Arabella had looked him over with
 an expression that was as good as saying," You are very much what I
 expected you to be
---
" Mother did n't wish."


---
Sue was about to
.


---
when she heard the knock and
---
Sue ran up to Jude's room and, and
---
she asked.


---
She scrutinized the child's features, and
---
What Arabella says
---
I see you in him!"


---
what I ca n't bear
---
But I ought to--
---
to get used to it; yes, I ought!"


---
I withdraw all remarks about your sexlessness.

---
And Sue, darling; I have an
 idea! 
---
What I could n't accomplish in my own person
---
perhaps I can carry out
 through him? 
---
said she, and. 
---
as she had looked at him
---
who's my REAL mother at last
---
Do I look like your father's wife?"


---
Can I call

---
Sue
 thereupon could not refrain from instantly doing likewise,.


---
" You may call me Mother, if you wish to, my poor dear!"
---
she said,
.


---
," said Sue. 
---
I suppose,
---
I
 feel. 
---
I do want; and
---
"," said Sue. 
---
because I look so aged
---
," said Sue tenderly. 
---
" I never was."


---
if I died in damnation
---
" Of course not," said Sue quickly;"!"


---
since she was hating you all the
 time
---
Both Sue and Jude together went to the office of the district
---
Sue looking over his shoulder
 and
---
As she read the
 four- square undertaking
---
to be
 made permanent, her face seemed.

---
not lovers, she thought).
---
she said on their way home.

---
During the interval before the issuing of the certificate, Sue, in her
 housekeeping errands, sometimes walked past the office, and
---
She could not bear its aspect. 
---
Coming after her
 previous experience of matrimony, all the romance of their attachment
 seemed. 
---
She was usually leading little Father Time by the hand,
 and.


---
that she would come
---
she
 did, bringing singular presents, in the form of apples, jam, brass
 snuffers, an ancient pewter dish, a warming- pan, and an enormous bag
 of goose feathers towards a bed. 
---
She was allotted the spare room in
 Jude's house,.


---
whither she retired early, and
---
where they could hear
 her through the ceiling below,,
---
As, however, she could not sleep, and
---
that Sue and Jude
 were still sitting up
---
she dressed
 herself again and, and
---
as your great- aunt was
---
Sue breathed uneasily.


---
She ran away from him, with their child,
 to her friends; and
---
while she was there
---
she would n't give it
 up. 
---
His wife went mad. 
---
" But I never heard of this.  A small slow voice rose from the shade of the fireside, as if out of
 the earth:" If I was you, Mother, I would n't marry Father!" ," said Sue cheeringly.


---
The next morning Sue,, took Jude privately into the sitting- room before starting.

---
" Jude, I want. 
---
," she said,

---
I wish.

---
But I suppose. 
---
as you used to your other wife
---
," she
 murmured. 
---
Sue, Jude, and the widow stood in the background
,. 
---
Sue reading the notices of marriage on the
 wall
---
; she
 was soon, obviously, and
---
she had a black eye.

---
She met him at the gaol gates, and. 
---
Sue turned her head and.

---
till she paused, and
---
her little voice began
 anew:"
---
as she
 would
---
as she must
---
And the other poor soul-- to
 escape a nominal shame which was owing to the weakness of her
 character,
---
who scorned her--
---
Sue said. 
---
she supposed
---
" Let," she said," and
."


---
whose meaning her brain
---
Sue and Jude listened,
 and.


---
" It is not the same to her, poor thing,
---
doing it
 over again with my present knowledge," Sue whispered. 
---
I feel doubts of-- my
 being proof against the sordid conditions of a business contract
 again!"


---
, are proposing
 to perjure ourselves," she said.


---
I fancy
---
I do think it--
---
While she hesitated
---
"; that's really,
 Sue!
---
Sue still held. 
---
till Sue said more brightly:


---
Sue sighed.


---
some women fail, and instead of protesting against the
 conditions they protest against the man, the other victim
---
just as a
 woman in a crowd will abuse the man who crushes against her, when he
 is only the helpless transmitter of the pressure put upon him
---
," she continued. 
---
accompanied by a woman of
 rather fine figure and rather red face, dressed in black material,
 and
---
when the woman said,"
---
Perhaps I can pick up a cheap bit of
 furniture or old china. 
---
since I was here
---
never since
 I lived as a girl at Aldbrickham, and
---
Then I'll get,
---
if I see
---
" any worth having," said his wife.


---
when her attention
 was attracted by a young couple leading a child, who had come out
 from the second platform,
---
" Sakes alive!" said Arabella.


---
when Arabella was new to him
---
Arabella so regulated her pace and her husband's. 
---
Her answers to Cartlett's remarks
 were vague and slight,.


---
for the group in front interested her more
 than all the rest of the spectacle
---
I suppose." " THEIR child! ' Tisn't their child," said Arabella with a curious,
 sudden covetousness. 
---
although the smouldering maternal instinct was strong enough
 in her
---
But to lead her to quash her husband's conjecture, she was not
 disposed on second thoughts to be more candid than necessary. 
---
" Oh I suppose not. 
---
She looks quite a girl.
---
The unwitting Sue and Jude, the couple
 in question, had determined. 
---
, in her
 new summer clothes, flexible and light as a bird, her little thumb
 stuck up by the stem of her white cotton sunshade,
---
Sue went along, and
---
as if
 she hardly touched ground
---
as if a moderately strong puff of wind
 would float her over the hedge into the next field. 
---
The pair with their charge passed through the turnstiles, Arabella
 and her husband not far behind them. 
---
When inside the enclosure the
 publican's wife could see.


---
" How she sticks to him!"
---
said Arabella. 
---
" Oh no-- I fancy, or
---
" But I thought?"


---
I should be ashamed of
 making myself so silly if I were he!"

" I do n't see as how there's anything remarkable in their behaviour.
 I should never have noticed their being in love,."

"," she rejoined. 
---
Nevertheless Cartlett's view
 of the lovers' or married pair's conduct was undoubtedly that of the
 general crowd, whose attention seemed to be in no way attracted by
 what Arabella's sharpened vision discerned.


---
as if she were some fairy
---
She's not a particular warm- hearted creature to my
 thinking,
---
though she cares for him pretty middling much-- as much as

---
she's able to; and
---
Before,
 however, she had regained their wake
---
a laughing face met her own,
 and
---
she was confronted by Anny, the friend of her girlhood.


---
" I am still living down there," she said,. 
---
as soon as
 she was composed
---
" I am soon going, but
---
though I've lost the rest of'em for the present
---
whatever she is?

---
I saw'em by now."


---
" I do n't know."


---
She's pretty
---
", is n't she!"


---
" I do n't know
---
but I ought
---
" Well, and what woman do n't I should like? 
---
-- she do n't know! 
---
at least what I call love
---
I
 can see in her face
---
she do n't."


---
what she calls love
---
" I'm sure I do n't wish to!... 
---
I should like. 
---
Why,, I verily believe!

---
when I used
---
I was just saying.
---
when you knew me as a girl
---
Arabella was induced.


---
I taught him the dead languages. 
---
I lost him; but
---
Arabella and her friends came to it in due course, and
---
" Admiring their own work," said Arabella. 
---
Arabella did not care;
 but
---
if they should recognize her
---
She walked round the outside of the listening throng, to- day. 
---
she noticed

---
Arabella whispered to herself
 morosely,.


---
as she rejoined her companions, with whom she preserved a
 preoccupied silence
---
" Now," said the physician to Arabella, apart;
---
She produced five shillings, the price
 asked, and slipped the phial in her capacious bosom. 
---
that she was due at an appointment with her husband
---
Saying
 presently, she
 sauntered away towards the refreshment bar, Jude, his companion, and
 the child.


---
where Arabella
 caught a glimpse of them standing before a group of roses in bloom
---
She waited a few minutes, and. 
---
She found.


---
Arabella
 remarked gloomily. 
---
come along" she returned, ready to quarrel
 with the sun for shining on her. 
---
at which she gazed
---
her eyes sparkle with vivacity
---
She adored roses,
 and
---
what Arabella had witnessed
---
Sue detaining Jude almost against
 his will while she learnt the names of this variety and that, and
---
she had
 said. 
---
" But I suppose
---
so that her nose went among the petals
---
Then she looked up at him, and.


---
that told so much to
 Arabella
---
She nodded.


---
But, she went on:"
---
And
 she looked at the aged child, whom, though they had taken him to
 everything likely to attract a young intelligence, they had utterly
 failed to interest.


---
discussed by
 other persons than Arabella
---
, previously been called Mrs. Bridehead
---
Sue now openly adopted the name of
 Mrs. Fawley. 
---
The baker's lad and the grocer's boy, to lift
 their hats gallantly to Sue to execute their errands,
 in these days no longer took the trouble
---
when they encountered her
---
Sue was always much affected at a picture of herself as an object of
 pity, and
---
she saddened.


---
," said she presently. 
---
" I am much depressed
 by the way they look at me here. 
---
I could
 not let! 
---
; I do! 
---
I shall be moving about probably--.
---
" I shall do something too, of course, till-- till-- 
---
Well, now I ca n't
 be useful in the lettering it behoves me to turn my hand to something
 else.
---
Sue could hear
 the conversation:

" Is Mr. Fawley at home?... 
---
On the second morning Sue came, and
---
what assistance
 she could render
---
The silence and emptiness of the building gave her confidence, and,

---
standing on a safe low platform, she began. 
---
She was quite pleased at her powers
---
; she had acquired them
 in the days she painted illumined texts for the church- fitting shop
 at Christminster. 
---
that a young woman
 was assisting
---
Sue had told him. 
---
She came down from her perch,
 and?"


---
Sue returned to her work. 
---
there shuffled in with a businesslike
 air the white- aproned woman who cleaned the church. 
---
Sue recognized
 her as one who had friends in Spring Street, whom she visited. 
---
The
 church- cleaner looked at Sue,;
---
she had

---
as the latter had recognized
 her
---
as Sue stood
---
till she grew so nervous that she
 trembled visibly
---
Sue could not hear which--"She's his wife,

---
Then she ought
---
who had been talking to the old woman
---
what she meant
---
Sue and Jude, working, sent back the child to school, and
---
she had been crying
 silently
---
However, in a few minutes Sue
 seemed.


---
she laughed
---
"," she said," that we two, of all people,
 with our queer history! 
---
And with her hand over her eyes she laughed again
 silently and intermittently,.


---
till she was quite weak
---
", are n't
 we, little girl!"


---
she sighed. 
---
as she took up the
 brush and
---
Sue cleansed her brush.

---
said
 she,. 
---
"-- I ought
 not
---
" I had no idea that anybody was going to intrude into such a lonely
 place and see us!" 
---
";
 and of course I would n't wish." 
---
Sue for the last time cooked her
 own, the child's, and Jude's breakfast in the little house he had
 furnished. 
---
to be a wet day; moreover Sue was unwell, and

---
not wishing to desert her poor Jude in such gloomy circumstances,
 to stay awhile, she acted on the suggestion of
 the auctioneer's man, and.

---
Sue silently took
 her companion's hand, and
---
Because Arabella is there
---
I must do
 something, if not church- gothic."

" I wish," she said,. 
---
" I am
. 
---
" I am not skilled in those... 
---
I ought. 
---
I
 grew up in the baking business with aunt,. 
---
They were Sue's pets, and
---
Sue tried. 
---
as she heard the trifling sum that her dears were deemed to be worth
 advanced by small stages to the price
---
When she was left alone
---
she waited patiently, but
---
At last she started,
---
on passing the
 poulterer's shop, not far off, she saw her pigeons in a hamper by the
 door. 
---
her to act on impulse
---
first looking around her
 quickly, she pulled out the peg which fastened down the cover, and
. 
---
Sue reached the lodging trembling, and. 
---
she asked breathlessly.


---
" Yes, I think. 
---
" Because, then, I've done such a wicked thing!" 
---
And she explained,
 in bitter contrition.


---
" I shall have,
---
" Yes!" said Sue vehemently.


---
which Sue had occupied
---
On a Saturday evening in May, nearly three years after Arabella's
 recognition of Sue and himself at the agricultural show, some of
 those met again.


---
There alighted two women, one the driver, an
 ordinary country person, the other a finely built figure in the deep
 mourning of a widow. 
---
Her sombre suit, of pronounced cut, caused
.


---
her to appear a little out of place in the medley and bustle of a
 provincial fair
---
," said the
 woman in weeds reprovingly. 
---
" I do n't care to. 
---
The companions then went their several ways, the one in crape walking
 firmly along with a mien of disconnection from her miscellaneous
 surroundings. 
---
she came to a hoarding, within which
 were excavations denoting the foundations of a building; and on
 the boards without one or two large posters announcing that the
 foundation- stone of the chapel about to be erected would be laid that
 afternoon at three o'clock by a London preacher of great popularity
 among his body.


---
By and by her attention was arrested by a little stall of cakes and
 ginger- breads,. 
---
tended by a young woman apparently unused to the business.


---
, she being
 accompanied by a boy with an octogenarian face, who assisted her
---
" His wife Sue-- if
 she is so!" 
---
She drew nearer to the stall. 
---
" she said blandly.


---
Sue changed colour and.


---
"" she said stiffly. 
---
And then perceiving
 Arabella's garb her voice grew sympathetic in spite of herself.

---
, I expect?
---
" Yes, I do. 
---
You be the woman I thought wer my mother for a bit, till

---
I found
---
Sue suddenly," go down to the station platform with this
 tray
---
Arabella continued:"
---
Sue writhed under the hard and direct questioning, and
---
her tender
 little mouth began.


---
And Sue's lips quivered again. 
---
she's leaving soon."


---
She had helped
 herself, and.


---
Sue sighed, and
---
she looked her distress at hearing him criticized.


---
Arabella was quizzing Sue with more regard of how she was speaking
 than of what she was saying. 
---
she said. 
---
She shook her head. 
---
" Because of the divorce, I suppose?
---
" I do n't care."


---
Sue's manner showed Arabella.


---
that her random guess was right
---
," continued Arabella. 
---
Sue's eyes darted a spark. 
---
she
 cried.


---
" Very well-- though I half- feel!... 
---
as if I should like
---
But Lord, I do n't want
---
though I should think
---
that I know
---
I am not the
 woman to find fault with what the Lord has ordained. 
---
I've reached a
 more resigned frame of mind.
---
" Indeed!  I wish."


---
I had been able to do so
---
Then Arabella wished Sue good- bye, and.




---
In the afternoon Sue and the other people bustling about Kennetbridge
 fair could hear. 
---
Arabella Cartlett and her
 weeds stood among them. 
---
She had a clear, powerful voice, which could
 be distinctly heard with the rest,
---
,
 her inflated bosom being also seen.


---
Arabella was in a thoughtful mood; but

---
her thoughts were not of the new chapel,.


---
late, her lover having jilted her.)


---
in which Arabella and Jude had lived during the first months of
 their marriage, and where the pig- killing had taken place
---
were passing the lonely
 house, she could
 control herself no longer.


---
she burst out. 
---
Arabella had hastily drawn from her pocket a bundle of tracts which
 she had brought with her to distribute at the fair, and
---
of which she
 had given away several. 
---
As she spoke. 
---
she flung the whole remainder
 of the packet into the hedge
---
Arabella did calm herself down by degrees; and
---
Arabella looked at him, and.

---
till at length she spoke
---
though her loss was a loss to me in more ways than one
---
" You lost your school and good income through her
---
the vicar having known me before my so- called eccentric
 conduct towards my wife
---
She has done
 no better."


---
" She is not doing well,
---
she is
 anything but thriving. 
---
You
 made a fool of a mistake about her
---
" She was innocent."


---
She was quite innocent of
 what obtained you your freedom, at the time you obtained it. 
---
" Still-- she wanted
---
But you should n't have let her. 
---
That's the only way with
 these fanciful women that chaw high-- innocent or guilty. 
---
She'd have

---
she's fond of her man still--
---
be of her. 
---
You were too quick about her. 
---
her go
---
her spirit for
 kicking would have been broke soon enough! 
---
There's nothing like
 bondage and a stone- deaf taskmaster for taming us women. 
---
the woman shall bear her iniquity.' 
---
Well; she's got

When all her" Christminster" cakes had been disposed of she took
 upon her arm the empty basket, and the cloth which had covered the
 standing she had hired, and. 
---
till they met an old woman carrying a child in short clothes,
 and
---
Sue kissed the children, and?"


---
She told him the
 pecuniary results, and then hesitated. 
---
At last,, she informed him of the unexpected meeting with Arabella, and
 the latter's widowhood.


---
" What-- is she living here?
---
" No; at Alfredston," said Sue.


---
" I thought?"
---
I had better tell
 you
---
she continued,.


---
What is she doing there?
---
She told him all she knew. 
---
" She has taken."


---
," Sue
 added;
---
Sue asked, a troublousness in her
 tones.


---
it would surprise
 her, perhaps,
---
she said pensively.

---
Well, I do
---
", I ca n't help it. 
---
I love the place--
---
although I know

---
;,, I see, my poor
 friend!... 
---
I pray so!... 
---
I should like! 
---
might, I think. 
---
I should like."


---
And she humbled her body greatly, and all the places
     of her joy she filled with her torn hair."--
---
I


 On their arrival the station was lively with straw- hatted young men,
.


---
"," said Sue. 
---
she said,.


---
" Oh, I must n't let; and
---
" to get a house over our heads first" she asked.


---
She saw from his face. 
---
," she answered. 
---
" I am
 sure this sight will awaken old sorrows in you, and do no good!"


---
while Sue and the others kept immediately behind him
---
"," said Sue.


---
Sue again wished.


---
said a woman.


---
Sue's face grew more emotional; but
---
though she stood close to Jude

---
she was screened.


---
" I may do some good--,
---
before I am dead
---
" I was, perhaps, after all, a paltry victim
 to the spirit of mental and social restlessness that makes so many
 unhappy in these days!"


---
what I appear
---
I am in a chaos of principles--. 
---
when I came
 here first
---
Eight or nine years ago, I had a neat stock of fixed opinions, but
---
the further I get the less sure I am. 
---
I doubt
. 
---
if I have anything more for my present rule of life than following
 inclinations which do me and nobody else any harm, and
---
I love best
---
how I was getting on
---
, I have told you. 
---
I can not explain further here. 
---
I perceive
---
Sue only possessed a small one, half sunshade. 
---
She
 had grown pale,.


---
" Let," she whispered,.

---
that seemed though to Sue
---
the newcomers knocked at the
 door of one, which a woman opened.


---
The householder scrutinized Sue's figure a moment. 
---
" to let," said she,.


---
" Now, Jude," said
 Sue
---
here the occupier, observing
 not only Sue, but the boy and the small children, said civilly,.


---
"," said Sue. 
---
" I'll pull my cloak more round
 me... 
---
How do I look now, dear?"


---
The woman
 here was more amiable; but
---
she had little room, and. 
---
They came to terms with
 her,. 
---
though her price was rather high for their pockets
---
in this house Sue took possession of a back room
 on the second floor with an inner closet- room for the children. 
---
she had taken in
---
Sue had not the art of prevarication, and,
---
after admitting several
 facts as to their late difficulties and wanderings, she was by the landlady?"


---
:

" Are you really a married woman
---
Sue hesitated; and
---
she was a married
 woman
---
Therefore, though in her own sense of the words, in the landlady's sense she was not.


---
Sue sat by
 the window in a reverie,. 
---
she was explaining to him the incoming of
 the lodgers during his absence.


---
" Now who wants such a woman here?

---
The wife expostulated, but,
---
for presently a tap came to Sue's door, and
---
the woman
 appeared.


---
when I said a single man" I am sorry to tell you, ma'am," she said,". 
---
that I ca n't let
---
therefore
 I must ask you. 
---
I do n't mind your staying over to- night,; but
---
I shall be glad."


---
Though she knew
---
that she was entitled to the lodging for a week
---
, Sue
 did not wish,
 and
---
she said. 
---
she would leave
---
Sue looked out of the window again. 
---
she proposed to the boy
---
Therefore, instead of unpacking her boxes,, they sallied out into the damp though
 not unpleasant streets,. 
---
Sue resolving
---
she
 wandered into this street and into that; but
---
though she tried a dozen
 different houses
---
she fared far worse alone, and. 
---
than she had fared in
 Jude's company
---
Every householder looked askance at such a woman and
 child inquiring for accommodation in the gloom.


---
" I ought,
---
not to be born ought I
---
where she was

---
where at least she had temporary shelter. 
---
she adhered to her determination not to disturb him till the next
 day.

II


 Sue sat
---
then she regarded the scene
 outside the uncurtained window. 
---
At some distance opposite, the outer
 walls of Sarcophagus College-- silent, black, and windowless-- threw
 their four centuries of gloom, bigotry, and decay into the little
 room she occupied,. 
---
She thought of
 the strange operation of a simple- minded man's ruling passion,. 
---
" said Sue despondently. 
---
" I am afraid this will
 trouble your father."


---
" I wish, and
---
" Can I do anything?"


---
that you are not my real mother,
 and
---
I ought n't
---
I troubled'em in Australia,
 and
---
I trouble folk here. 
---
I wish!"


---
I had n't been born
---
" I think!"


---
Sue did not reply. 
---
She was doubtfully pondering.


---
She at last concluded.


---
that, so far, she
 would be honest and candid with one who entered into her difficulties
 like an aged friend
---
to be another in our family soon," she hesitatingly
 remarked.


---
Yes, I have
---
", I am sorry to say!
---
" murmured Sue, her eyes glistening
 with suspended tears.


---
she pleaded, her bosom heaving
 now as much as the boy's.
---
I ca n't explain--
---
" I will. 
---
as if I had done it on purpose
---
I ca n't explain, dear! 
---
-- I ca n't help it!"


---
I wo n't forgive you, ever, ever! 
---
I'll
 never believe!"


---
There she heard!"


---
," she cried, rather peremptorily. " But
---
The following morning she awoke at a little past six, and. 
---
She arose softly,.


---
as she knew
---
She found Jude at breakfast in the obscure tavern he had chosen as a
 counterpoise to the expense of her lodging: and
---
she explained to him
 her homelessness. 
---
She joined Jude in a hasty meal, and in a quarter of an hour they
 started together, resolving to clear out from Sue's too respectable
 lodging immediately. 
---
On reaching the place and going upstairs she
 found. 
---
which she had brought with her
---
she put
 them into the boiling kettle, and
---
while she went
---
A shriek from Sue suddenly caused
. 
---
as she pushed
 it back
---
that Sue had sunk to the floor just within it
---
those of the girl and the baby boy were closed.


---
Sue lie
---
Sue had come to herself, and
---
the two helpless
 women, bending over the children in wild efforts to restore them,
 and the triplet of little corpses, formed a sight which overthrew
 his self- command. 
---
They carried her away against her wish to a room on the
 lower floor; and
---
there she lay,.


---
her slight figure shaken with her
 gasps, and
---
her eyes staring at the ceiling,
---
the woman of the house
 vainly trying
---
she implored, and
---
that,, her presence might
 do harm, and
---
lest she should endanger a coming life
---
Her inquiries were
 incessant, and
---
as she could speak
---
As soon she informed him.


---
what she had said to the
 boy, and
---
how she thought herself the cause of this
---
this stimulated Sue to efforts of sympathy which in
 some degree distracted her from her poignant self- reproach. 
---
, she was allowed.


---
said Sue.


---
, her spasmodic breathing suspended
---
I suppose.

---
She sobbed again. 
---
till she was seized with another uncontrollable
 fit of grief
---
she went back again to her room. 
---
, she would not now have removed,
---
But she
 implored him, and.


---
when she also attempted
---
she cried out, after
 one of these. 
---
that we
 should be joyful in what instincts she afforded us--
---
She sank into a quiet contemplation,.--
---
till she said,"
---
Yes-- I see! 
---
Again Sue looked at the hanging little frock and at the socks and
 shoes; and
---
her figure quivered like a string. 
---
"," she said," good neither for earth nor heaven any more!

---
I am driven out of my mind by things! 
---
She stared at Jude, and.


---
She paused. 
---
" she asked heavily.


---
for
 I did get you
---
After such momentary diversions her grief would return in a wave.


---
Sue had declared, but
---
that she would follow the two little
 ones to the grave
---
at the last moment she gave way, and
---
while she was lying
 down
---
The woman thought, but

---
she was still lying down
---
that she was not in her bedroom after all
---
Her hat and jacket, too, were missing
---
: she had gone out. 
---
She had not
 been there. 
---
It was Sue,.


---
which she had never thought of changing for the mourning he
 had bought
---
till I've seen my little ones
 again
---
she cried wildly. 
---
when she saw Jude
---
" I want. 
---
I want! 
---
I did n't know you
! 
---
while I was asleep
---
I
 should see them once more before they were screwed down" She's been wanting, and
---
her get
 to the coffins
---
" She ought. 
---
She is hardly responsible, poor thing,
 seemingly. 
---
But Sue kept! 
---
Thus she went on. 
---
till
 she helplessly gave in, and
---
she deprecated, and. 
---
Sue was at once got to bed, and
---
III


 Sue was convalescent,
---
though she had hoped for death, and
---
Vague
 and quaint imaginings had haunted Sue in the days,
---
when her intellect
 scintillated like a star
---
she said mournfully. 
---
" she murmured. 
---
she said quickly. 
---
" I supported you in your resolve to leave Phillotson; and
---
" I should have, just the same. 
---
that she was not the Sue of their earlier time
---
," she said, with a little quiver in her words,
---
" Yes" I have had
 dreadful fears, a dreadful sense of my own insolence of action.

---
I have thought--!"


---
that I am still his wife
---
" Oh I ca n't explain! 
---
Sue sighed uneasily.


---
that Sue and himself had mentally travelled in opposite directions
 since the tragedy: events which had enlarged his own views of life,
 laws, customs, and dogmas
---
She was no longer the same as in the independent days, when
 her intellect played like lambent lightning over conventions and
 formalities which he at that time respected,.


---
She was
 not at home, but
---
she soon returned,.


---
dear!--there's no evil woman in you. 
---
And, you are absolutely the most ethereal, least sensual
 woman I ever knew to exist without inhuman sexlessness. 
---
as if
 she were an infant
---
not to stay like this," she murmured,.


---
when she had remained
 in the position a long while
---
She paused, and. 
---
" Never," she whispered.


---
Not knowing the whole of her meaning he took the objection serenely,
 and. 
---
she had

---
that she was wide awake
 all the time
---
She sat upright and.


---
She stopped. 
---
till she
 could control the lumpiness of her throat
---
You certainly ARE my wife, Sue, in all but
 law. 
---
a woman's form appeared.


---
she sat down in the window
 bench, where they could distinctly see her outline against the light;
 but no characteristic that enabled them to estimate her general
 aspect and air. 
---
that she was not

---
as she
 had been during Cartlett's lifetime
---
though she had never replied to his letter
---
I have just come from the cemetery
---
"," she said. 
---
" I inquired and

---
I could n't come to the funeral--
---
I read all about it in the papers,
 and
---
I felt... 
---
I was n't wanted
---
I could n't come to the funeral,"
. 
---
" But I am glad I
 found the grave. 
---
" I shall put up a headstone
---
A sigh came from the dark corner where Sue sat.


---
The unexpectedness of her words struck Jude silent.


---
," said Arabella. 
---
" I thought!"


---
missed by Arabella. 
---
that she was struck by Sue's avowal,
---
for whom, though in his lifetime she had shown no care at all
---
she now exhibited a ceremonial mournfulness that was apparently
 sustaining to the conscience. 
---
She alluded to the past, and
---
in making
 some remark appealed again to Sue. 
---
There was no answer: Sue had
 invisibly left the room.


---
" She said?".

---
she was not your wife
---
" Why should she do that?"


---
I can not inform you
---
She is
---
", is n't she? 
---
She once told me so."


---
what she says
---
Mother died
 of dys
---
Jude's former wife had maintained a stereotyped manner of strict good
, and. 
---
that Sue was gone
---
When
 she had departed Jude
---
what had become of her
---
she
 had not come in
---
as she often went there
---
" She knows somebody who keeps the key, and
---
she has it."


---
whenever she
 wants it
---
" How long has she been going on with this?"


---
; she had turned up her face.


---
" she said almost sharply.

---
I wanted! 
---
" Why do I come? 
---
, I should like! 
---
if
 I have not
---
I ca n't bear it!--I
---
as I am
---
I am a wretch-- broken by my
 distractions! 
---
I could n't BEAR it--
---
when Arabella came
---
I felt so
 utterly miserable I had to come away. 
---
She seems, and
---
I see marriage differently now. 
---
Arabella's child
 killing mine was a judgement--
---
What,
 WHAT shall I do! 
---
I am such a vile creature-- too worthless to mix
 with ordinary human beings!"


---
That a woman- poet, a woman- seer, a woman-- should degrade herself like this! 
---
though she came
---
, she preferred.


---
," she said in a sweet and imploring voice.

---
" I love you as much as ever! 
---
Only-- I ought. 
---
Oh I must not any more!"


---
" I ca n't own it."


---
" But I have made up my mind! 
---
that I am not your wife
---
I belong to
 him
---
-- I sacramentally joined myself to him for life. 
---
is it common to woman? 
---
Is a woman a thinking
 unit at all, or
---
she had returned the key. 
---
" Can this be the girl
---
" can this be the girl who brought
 the pagan deities into this most Christian city?-- who mimicked Miss

---
when she crushed them with her heel?--
---
Arabella's coming was the
 finish. 
---
before she could hinder him
---
," she said with suppressed
 tears,
---
" I will-- if, if you really wish? 
---
She said. 
---
she wanted no supper, and

---
she found. 
---
She
 went to him,."


---
Women could
---
An average woman is
 in this superior to an average man-- that she never instigates, only
. 
---
if you had n't
 broken me down by making me fear you would go back to her
---
" Yes...  But Sue" my old
 reproach to you was, after all, a true one. 
---
Sue burst out. 
---
The woman mostly gets the worst of
 it in the long run!"


---
" She does."


---
Unless she is absolutely worthless and contemptible
---
Sue drew a nervous breath or two. 
---
She is
---
Sue looked at him, and.

---
she brokenly murmured. 
---
she, starting up
---
till she said,"
---
And then gently pressing him away she got free,
---
whom Sue, in her mental_ volte- face_, was now regarding as
 her inseparable husband
---
I saw to- day" I saw her, too."

" You said nothing."


---
that she was innocent
---
I might have. : I have good
 reason for supposing that she was innocent when I divorced her-- that
 I was all wrong. " She has taken care, anyhow, apparently."


---
what she had gained by leaving him
---
Arabella having made her home at Alfredston, and
---
, it was not wonderful that in
 a few weeks they met again-- the precise time being just after her
 return from Christminster, where she had stayed much longer than she
 had at first intended,. 
---
she was approaching the town.


---
"," she replied. 
---
where I lived

---
for I've been visiting at
 Christminster. 
---
Yes; I've seen Jude."


---
She do n't live with him any
 longer. 
---
I only heard of it as a certainty
---
just before I left
---
; though
 I had thought."


---
when I
 called on them
---
Why, I should have thought'."


---
She has never really married him
. 
---
And now, instead
 of this sad event making, and get, she's took in a queer religious way,
---
just as I was in my
 affliction at losing Cartlett
---
And she says,
---
so I was told,--
---
that she's your wife in the
 eye of Heaven and the Church
---
And
 perhaps she feels, over and above other things,. 
---
that I ought
---
I ca n't say. 
---
However, as for me, I am soon off
 from here. 
---
I've got, and
---
I hope soon."


---
Arabella gave it.


---
Arabella smiled grimly, and.


---
as she resumed her way
---
that her recalcitrant
 spirit would soon have been broken
---
that she came willingly
---
that now she was gone
---
her be
---
if she were anybody's wife
---
that she was
 the wife of the man to whom she had borne three children and owed
 such tragical adventures
---
Sue wo n't
---
She's affected by Christminster
 sentiment and teaching. 
---
where she got them
---
her having lived with and
---
that it has done little
 more than finish her education
---
what that woman said
---
that her views had considerably changed
---
that she should come to him there at Marygreen

I would rather not come in.

I want

It had been in the trembling accents of Sue.

---
; she, too, was
 now such a mere cluster of nerves that all initiatory power seemed
 to have left her, and
---
," she presently said,
---
I am going back to
 Richard. 
---
But of
 course I AM his wife already. 
---
" But you are MY wife! 
---
I have always
 regretted that feint of ours in going away and pretending to come
 back legally married,. 
---
I loved you, and
---
" Yes; I know
---
," she answered with despairing
 self- suppression. 
---
" But I am going,. 
---
" I should? 
---
" I should have felt just the same--
---
And I would go back to Richard without repeating the sacrament,. 
---
The blow of her
 bereavement seemed. 
---
her conviction was proof against
 all. 
---
on which she was firm,
 and
---
that her firmness in this had left her tottering in every other
 impulse and
---
she possessed
---
to let,
 and to tell it you myself," she said in cut tones;. 
---
I
 have even owned the extreme fact that I do not love him. 
---
I did not
 think! 
---
I was going to

---
But I suppose."


---
" Why, of course I will. 
---
" No-- I wo n't let him. 
---
I go to him voluntarily,. 
---
just as I went away
 from him
---
She was so sadly sweet in what he called her wrong- headedness that
 Jude could not help being moved to tears more than once for pity of
 her. 
---
" I never knew such a woman for doing impulsive penances, as
 you, Sue! 
---
Jude, I must say good- bye! 
---
But I wanted
. 
---
Sue had been there often, and
---
she knew the way
 to the spot in the dark. 
---
-- I should like to part
---
"," said she.


---
because I have acted on conviction
---
Sue's slim shape was only just discernible.


---
Sue's gone from me--
---
She in the meantime had left by the train, and. 
---
where she entered the steam- tram and
---
She wished.


---
, she said,
---
she hired at the Bear
---
Marygreen set her down at the end of the lane, half a mile from the
 village, by her desire, and. 
---
as she had brought
---
On its return she
 encountered it, and. 
---
that her things
 had been taken in by the schoolmaster himself
---
She could now enter Marygreen without exciting much observation.

---
She crossed by the well and under the trees to the pretty new school
 on the other side, and. 
---
I've come, Richard
---
"," said she,. 
---
I can not believe
---
"-- you forgive your-- wife!"


---
" Everything, darling Susanna," said Phillotson.


---
She started at the endearment,. 
---
Then she nerved herself again.


---
Sue imperceptibly shrank away,
---
she said, with a hurried smile of apprehension. 
---
" To- morrow morning, early, I thought--. 
---
I am

---
I have told
 him all, and
---
" Yes, yes, I can! 
---
I want. 
---
-- I ca n't wait long!"


---
I'll tell the vicar half- past eight to- morrow,
 before anybody is about--? 
---
Unlike a woman in ordinary,,
 Sue seemed. 
---
she uttered a little" Oh!
---
in placing her muff
 upon it her eye had caught a document which lay there. 
---
she said,.


---
as she
 came back to the table
---
Sue nervously
 made herself agreeable to him by talking on whatever she thought
 likely to interest him, except herself, though that interested him
 most of all. 
---
She obediently ate some supper, and. 
---
her lodging hard by
---
The old woman accompanied Sue to her temporary quarters, and. 
---
she laid out
---
said Sue quickly. 
---
" I did n't
 mean. 
---
She handed a new and
 absolutely plain garment, of coarse and unbleached calico.


---
She took it, and.


---
Mrs. Edlin lifted her hands, and
---
Sue excitedly continued,.


---
Sue repeated. 
---
Sue flung her face upon the bed,. 
---
She remained and.


---
She remained with her face in the bed- clothes, and
---
A light was burning in Sue's room, a
 shadow moving now and then across the blind.


---
Well: you've all but got her again
 at last
---
She ca n't very well go a second time. 
---
her being
---
what
 she is
---
Apart from, of course, a luxury for a fogey like me, it will set me right
 in the eyes of the clergy and orthodox laity, who have never forgiven
 me for letting her go. 
---
if you've got any sound reason for marrying her again
---
You might
 have been a school inspector by this time, or a reverend, if you
 had n't been so weak about her."


---
her housed again
---
her go
---
Whatever justice
 there was in releasing her
---
that the reactionary spirit would make Phillotson more orthodoxly cruel to her

---
Women are so strange in their influence
 that they tempt you to misplaced kindness. 
---
She'll come to any terms in time."


---
that was made about my agreeing to her elopement. '
---
if she'll come
---
after the
 divorce she should have thought of doing so
---
her to unpack her
 things
---
She's forcing herself to it, poor dear little thing;
---
and
 you've no notion what she's suffering. 
---
her do this
---
" It's her wish, and
---
She's his wife if anybody's. 
---
She's had three
 children by him, and
---
it's a wicked shame to
 egg her on to this, poor little quivering thing! 
---
She's got nobody
 on her side. 
---
who'd be her friend the obstinate creature

---
What first put her into this mood o
---
It is all voluntary on her part.

---
If she is really compelling herself to this against her
 instincts-- merely from this new sense of duty or religion--
---
her wait a bit
---
when she gave that little cry at sight of the licence
---
But they do n't know Sue.

---
she has ever done anything against her conscience
---
her having lived with Fawley
---
At the time
 she left me for him
---
she thought. 
---
she was quite within her right
---
Now
 she thinks otherwise."


---
She had never in her life looked
 so much like the lily her name connoted as she did in that pallid
 morning light. 
---
the strain on her
 nerves had preyed upon her flesh and bones, and
---
she appeared smaller
 in outline,.


---
than she had formerly done
---
though Sue had not been a
 large woman in her days of rudest health
---
" Prompt," said the schoolmaster, magnanimously taking her hand.

---
they left the house, Widow Edlin
 continuing steadfast in her refusal to assist in the ceremony.


---
said Sue. 
---
She had not lived there for any
 length of time, and
---
in her
 preoccupation forgot the new one.


---
Sue said no more; and
---
when the
 clergyman came to the words," What God hath joined," a woman's voice
 from among these
---
Sue was making a pretence of doing
 some housewifery as if she lived there. 
---
But she seemed timid at his
 approach, and
---
Sue brightened a little.




---
A woman in shabby black stood on the doorstep talking to Jude,
 who held the door in his hand.


---
for a woman to keep virtuous
---
The woman in the rain was Arabella, the evening being
 that of the day after Sue's remarriage with Phillotson.


---
" said Arabella. 
---
She bent her head against
 the doorpost and.


---
" She has really taken me quite unawares; but

---
till she
 could get out of the strait she was in-- not by her own fault, and
---
as she
 declared--
---
Arabella said:"?
---
, I suppose
---
" I guess; but
---
I know nothing."


---
" I had a letter from Anny at Alfredston to- day.
---
She had just heard
: but
---
she did n't know."


---
" I do n't wish."


---
what kind of woman--"

" Do n't speak of her I say! 
---
She's a fool! 
---
And she's an angel, too,
 poor dear!
---
Arabella was duly installed in the little attic, and
---
at first she
 did not come near Jude at all. 
---
She went to and fro about her own
 business, which, when they met for a moment on the stairs or in the
 passage, she informed him was that of obtaining another place in
 the occupation she understood best. 
---
, she shook her
 head. 
---
," she said.
---
On the Sunday morning following,, she meekly asked him.


---
if she might come in to breakfast
 with him,
---
as she had broken her teapot, and
---
she suddenly observed:". 
---
I'm sorry for you.
---
" I am all in a brood."


---
It is about her
---
", I know. 
---
I could find
 out all about the wedding--."


---
" I wanted. 
---
I left there
---
And
 I could see Anny, who'll be sure to have heard all about it, as she
 has friends at Marygreen."


---
Arabella went,
---
When she had gone
---
She's nothing to
 me-- nor the other neither!"


---
she might bring, and
---
Arabella had made dimples
 most successfully all the way home, and. 
---
when she stepped out of the
 railway carriage she smiled
---
She observed, however, the
 hard strain upon his lip as he spoke.


---
she has heard from Belinda, her relation out at Marygreen
---
She wanted
---
to marry him again, did n't she?

---
She wanted to in one sense, but not in the
 other. 
---
But Sue was that excited about it that she burnt her
 best embroidery that she'd worn with you, to blot you out entirely.

---
if a woman feels like it
---
Well--, she ought. 
---
I commend her
 for it,." 
---
Arabella sighed. 
---
" She felt, and. 
---
that she belonged to nobody else in the sight of
 God A'mighty
---
Perhaps another woman feels the same
 about herself, too!" 
---
Arabella sighed again.


---
" I do n't want!"
---
" ca," said Arabella. 
---
" I feel exactly the same as she!"


---
-- now I know all
---
Well I
 wanted
---
I am not going
 back to my lodgings just yet.
---
Sue had not dwelt on this.


---
Arabella, meanwhile, had gone back. 
---
At half- past nine Arabella herself went out, first
.


---
" Well," she said to him,". 
---
for all your rowing me that night, I've
 called in,
---
for I have something to tell you
---
I think. 
---
I shall get
 married and settled again
---
" I'll do anything!"


---
I am now going. 
---
I'm afraid, and
---
I must get him home. 
---
I want
---
to fasten the door, in case I should want, and."


---
" I thought!"


---
She then sallied out again, and
---
where she had been

---
She had no sooner opened the door of the
" Private Bar". 
---
she entered and.


---
I'm trying
---
to forget her: that's all! 
---
But
 I ca n't; and
---
I am going home." 
---
She saw.


---
" I've come entirely. 
---
Arabella held up her
 finger to the barmaid. 
---
I'll treat you, poor chap!"


---
" I do n't care which! 
---
Sue has served me badly,
 very badly. 
---
I did n't expect it of Sue! 
---
I stuck to her, and
---
she
 ought. 
---
I'd have sold my soul for her sake, but

---
she would n't risk hers a jot for me. 
---
To save her own soul she lets

---
But it is n't her fault, poor little girl
---
-- I am
 sure it is n't!"


---
How Arabella had obtained money
---
she ordered a
 liqueur each, and. 
---
Arabella kept very considerably
 in the rear of Jude; but
---
though she only sipped
---
, she
 took as much.


---
as she could safely take without losing her head-- which
 was not a little, as the crimson upon her countenance showed
---
to turn out; whereupon Arabella put her
 arm round his waist, and.


---
she said:". 
---
I do n't know
---
I expect,.
---
I do n't know
---
"-- I do n't know."


---
I tell you,

---
-- I made it up
 with him a bit to- day. 
---
I can let you in, and
---
Sue to understand such things
---
And she's gone--
---
I'm giving my body!  And I
 was her seducer-- poor little girl!  and I do n't care
 about myself!  And yet she did it for
 conscience' sake, poor little Sue!"


---
she was right
---
" Hang her!--I mean, I think" I've
 my feelings too, like her; and I feel I belong to you in Heaven's
 eye, and It is-- hic-- never
 too late-- hic to mend!"


---
she softly unfastened the
 door,.


---
though
 she did
---
" I ca n't find the matches, dear," she said. 
---
when she had fastened up
 the door
---
She pulled off his boots. 
---
" Now," she whispered,
---
VII


 Arabella was preparing breakfast in the downstairs back room of this
. 
---
She put her head
 into the little pork- shop in front, and.

---
Donn, endeavouring to look like a master pork- butcher, in a greasy
 blue blouse, and with a strap round his waist from which a steel
 dangled, came in promptly.


---
She looked deedily into his face.

---
said Donn, humour- struck, and
 nodding to the ceiling.


---
I'd have had a new one."


---
while I was about it
---
" It is n't rum for a woman,
---
And Arabella was suddenly seized with
 a fit of loud laughter, in which her father joined more moderately.


---
I'll do the rest
---
" Be civil to him, and," she said. 
---
when she had
 recovered seriousness
---
I'll pay back to you again.

---
But I must go up and."


---
Arabella ascended the stairs,. 
---
her shorn Samson
---
she entered to the bedside and. 
---
"" said she. 
---
" Ah!--where-- oh yes, I remember! 
---
I am
 stranded-- ill--! 
---
what I am
---
I'll tell them at
 the stoneworks that you are knocked up."


---
" I wonder!"


---
" I'll go round and explain. 
---
Arabella took his purse,
---
her
 outdoor things went off to the lodgings
---
she and he had quitted the
 evening before.


---
she reappeared round the
 corner,.

---
which she had taken to the lodging for her short sojourn there
---
" Now," said Arabella to her father downstairs,"
---
I know his
 nature, and
---
I shall be left in the lurch. 
---
; for I must have that ready at hand,. 
---
Donn had only just opened his miserable little pork and sausage
 shop, which had as yet scarce any customers
---
Arabella took him at his word so far as the men went, but.


---
" Yes!" cried Arabella,. 
---
that she was sitting beside Jude,
---
her arm being

---
," she continued bashfully, and. 
---
her spirituous
 crimson look as much like a maiden blush as possible
---
what she was announcing
---
till Arabella
 whispered to her father
---
" Now, old darling," she said to Jude. 
---
" When did I promise anything?" asked he, whom she had made so tipsy
 by her special knowledge of that line of business as almost to have
.


---
" Why!" said Arabella,. 
---
I do n't remember it
---
" There's only one
 woman-- but
---
Arabella looked towards her father. 
---
,"
 said Donn. 
---
Of course I should n't have had such goings on in my house
. 
---
if I had n't understood that
---
" I'd marry the W---- of Babylon! 
---
" Keep your figures for your debts to friends," said
 Donn.


---
If I am bound in honour--
---
as I suppose--
---
I am
---
" to marry her though
 how I came
---
I know no more than a dead man
---
her I will, so help me God! 
---
I have never behaved dishonourably to
 a woman or to any living thing. 
---
I am not a man who wants to save
 himself at the expense of the weaker among us!"


---
" There-- never mind him, deary," said she,. 
---
Arabella, too, had hastily arranged herself,
 and
---
accompanied by Donn away
---
" Do n't go," she said to the guests at parting. 
---
" I've told the little
 maid; and
---
When Arabella, Jude, and Donn had disappeared on their matrimonial

---
" I do n't wish
---
She's got that
---
her say so to her
 father
---
she's not such a bad- looking
 piece-- particular by candlelight. 
---
But for a woman, she's passable enough. 
---
Their eyes followed the movements of the little girl as she spread
 the breakfast- cloth on the table they had been using, without wiping
 up the slops of the liquor. 
---
: but I like a woman that a puff o' wind wo n't
 blow down."

" By Gad, they are coming! 
---
First into the room came Arabella boisterously; and
---
her
 face was enough to show that her strategy had succeeded.


---
' The Church do n't recognize divorce in her
 dogma,
---
She said,
 and
---
I ought
---
I have straightway. 
---
" I've got a bargain for my trouble in marrying thee over
 again!"
---
Arabella was saying to him. 
---
" I shall have
---
I shall have
---
all to support an
 invalid husband I'd
---
when she had taken a
 little cordial
---
She asked
 him indifferently.


---
me to write to her for
---
how she is
---
if she'll come
---
" To ask, and to see me, because I'm ill,
 and."


---
like you to insult a lawful wife by asking such a thing
---
I love Sue. 
---
I do n't wish
---
to mince the matter-- there stands the
 fact: I love her. 
---
I could find a dozen ways of sending a letter to
 her without your knowledge. 
---
But I wish. 
---
A message through you asking her to come
 is at least free from any odour of intrigue. 
---
If she retains any of
 her old nature at all
---
, she'll come."


---
" I should think NOT!"


---
HER to know
---
She do n't want. 
---
She's the rat that forsook the sinking ship!"


---
" And I stuck to un-- the more fool I! 
---
before Arabella knew
---
where she was
---
I'll kill
 you-- here and now! 
---
I've everything to gain by it-- my own death. 
---
" Promise never to speak of her."


---
I do.
---
I take your word
---
she estimated his life with an
 appraiser's eye. 
---
,"
 Arabella murmured,"."


---
if you'll agree to my being in the room with you
 all the time she's here
---
if she had written
---
" Yes," she said;". 
---
I wrote a note
---
I have n't posted it yet."


---
if she really did post it
---
She did not come; but
---
no Sue appeared
---
that Arabella had never posted hers,
---
although she had written
 it
---
There was something in her manner which told it. 
---
Arabella, like some other nurses, thought.


---
when, after an absence of
 two hours, she came into the room
---
One midday, she beheld the chair empty.


---
Down she flopped on the bed, and. 
---
" she said.


---
Yet a conviction
 possessed Arabella, and
---
when she had searched the house
---
she said. 
---
" I can do no more."


---
if she will
 be kind enough to come to the church for a few minutes
---
" Oh-- I did n't think! 
---
A hysterical
 catch in her breath ended in a succession of them. 
---
she quickly recovered and.


---
I thought
. 
---
And I shall
 never come again. 
---
I'll stay
---
"-- I wo n't be unkind!
---
" she said,. "
---
her mouth quivering and her
 tears
---
as she allowed
---
She has
 never been other than yours, Jude-- in a proper sense. 
---
, it is
 this meretricious contract with Arabella which has been called doing
 the right thing! 
---
" Do n't make-- I ca n't bear much! 
---
But on this
 point I am decided.
---
" I can not understand--!"


---
-- I can not
---
And I-- I've wrestled
 and. 
---
I have nearly brought my body
 into complete subjection. 
---
I would argue with you. 
---
if I
 did n't know
---
that a woman in your state of feeling is quite beyond all
 appeals to her brains
---
as
 so many women do about these things
---
I WOULD have died game!"


---
She turned
 off quickly.


---
" I will. 
---
I would never come,. 
---
even if I had the
 strength to come, which I shall not have any more
---
Her bosom began. 
---
" I ca n't endure you!"

---
she burst out, and
---
, she turned back
 impulsively. 
---
I am not a coward and a contemptible humbug
---
I
 ca n't bear it!" 
---
She rushed up to him and,
---
" I must tell you-- oh my darling Love
---
I must--
---
I mean
---
at all since I came back to him
---
The words struck her like a blow, and
---
she bent her head. 
---
she gasped presently. 
---
She ran up the church to the east end, and
---
as she requested
---
which she had not
 seen, and
---
she
 heard, and in a last
 instinct of human affection, even now unsubdued by her fetters
---
, she
 sprang up. 
---
But she knelt down again, and

---
She looked him up and down.


---
she asked.


---
I have
---
"," said she. 
---
" I do n't
 know."


---
" Of course I do. 
---
I meant."


---
" Well, I'm blest! 
---
I could
 not resent your conduct. 
---
But I am not so weak in another way. 
---
I made up my mind that a man confined to his room by
 inflammation of the lungs, a fellow who had only two wishes left in
 the world,
---
That I've done. 
---
I have seen her for the last time, and
!"


---
I've finished myself--
---
I see,!"


---
when I first walked here
---
" I seem, and. 
---
as I did then
---
I do n't believe in half of them.

---
" Oh-- I was talking to myself! 
---
I never saw the streets
 emptier."


---
" I do n't want! 
---
, I tell you! 
---
What do I care about
 folk dead and? 
---
" I must rest a moment and
---
But, Arabella,, you'll see!"


---
which she often did now before bedtime
---
Sue was muddling helplessly in the kitchen,,.


---
for she was not a good
 housewife
---
though she tried, and
---
" They say that when the saints were upon the
 earth devils used to take husbands' forms o' nights, and get poor
 women into all sorts of trouble. 
---
No woman ought.
---
when Mrs. Edlin put on her bonnet and leave
---
Half an hour later shawl to
, Sue seemed.


---
I will drink my cup to the dregs!"

" she implored,
---
her eyes enlarged, and
 with a quick nervous look over her shoulder.


---
She then fastened up the doors, and
---
whether I be there or no" Wait here, Mrs. Edlin," said Sue. 
---
" I'll go into my old room a
 moment by myself."


---
Sue turned to the chamber which had
 been hers exclusively since her arrival at Marygreen, and
---
She then arose,
 and. 
---
She
 wished Mrs. Edlin good- night, and
---
the widow entered the room that Sue
 had just vacated.


---
Sue unlatched the other chamber door, and,
---
she half opened
 the door, and." 
---
As the word came out of her mouth
---
she
 visibly shuddered.


---
Sue seemed relieved, and hurried back to Mrs. Edlin's chamber. 
---
she asked.


---
she gasped. 
---
Sue had dragged herself back. 
---
The strained, resigned look returned to Sue's face. 
---
when she was
 alone
---
I am
 sorry I called you out." " I must do it-- I must!  I must drink to the dregs!" she
 whispered."
---
" she said again.


---
I jumped out of the window rather than
---
I have never reversed that treatment till
 now--.
---
when I have come, and
---
I do n't wish you to
.
---
She waited a moment, and! 
---
She had been intending."

---
But, as a contrite woman always keeps back a little,
---
She went on:". 
---
She swore.


---
Sue started back.


---
A quick look of
 aversion passed over her face, but
---
she uttered
 no cry.


---
when she said to herself:"
---
Ah-- perhaps I'd better go and
---
that Sue had disappeared
---
But Arabella saw. 
---
" I'm hanged!"
---
she would say,"!"


---
" I was never really stout enough for the stone trade,
 particularly the fixing. 
---
I think. 
---
But I felt.

---
I could do one thing
---
if I had the opportunity
---
I could accumulate ideas, and. 
---
I wonder... 
---
I hear. 
---
as I was
---
I do n't know much about it. 
---
said Arabella. 
---
" I should have thought
. 
---
" I wish!"
---
said Arabella
 indignantly. 
---
" Calling a respectable married woman by the name of
 that--"  She remembered herself and
---
when she saw, and

---
how very little she had
---
But in the course of time, to fear from Sue's rivalry, she had a fit of
 generosity. 
---
" I suppose?
---
to see your-- Sue" she said. 
---
" Well,
 I do n't mind. 
---
her coming
---
You can have her here."


---
" I do n't wish."


---
that I'm ill, or anything
---
She has chosen her course. 
---
her go
---
Jude's wife,, went out,. 
---
how Sue was
---
what Sue had told him:"
---
She's begun it
 quite lately-- all of her own free will."


---
" When did she begin?"
---
she insisted.
---
got to talk to myself lying here so many hours alone-- she was once
 a woman whose intellect was to mine like a star to a benzoline lamp:
. 
---
that she could brush away
 with a word
---
her intellect
 broke, and
---
she veered round to darkness. 
---
Strange difference of sex,
 that time and circumstance,,
 narrow the views of women almost invariably. 
---
her giving herself like this to what she loathes, in
 her enslavement to forms
---
She, so sensitive, so shrinking,... 
---
they met with brought reaction in her, and
 recklessness and ruin on me!
---
The lanky form was that of
 Physician Vilbert, who had been called in by Arabella.


---
since I let out some gossip by accident I hope."

 I'll go up and. " She's not in at present, but
---
she'll be here soon."


---
Arabella inquired. 
---
" I'll bring it to you here in the passage," she said. 
---
She brought him a bottle and a glass, and
---
Arabella began. 
---
she said:
" do n't you re- member?"


---
I poured your own love- philtre into it,
---
I do
---
", I do! 
---
" Do n't do n't," she whispered,."
---
She let him out of the house, and
---
as she went back
---
she said to
 herself:". 
---
Well!  Weak women must provide for a rainy day
---
as I suppose
---
And I ca n't pick and. 
---
as I could

---
when I was younger
---
Arabella was at the looking- glass curling
 her hair,. 
---
which operation she performed by heating an umbrella- stay
 in the flame of a candle she had lighted, and using it upon the
 flowing lock
---
When she had finished this
---
, she cast her eyes round upon Jude. 
---
Arabella, hatted, gloved, and ready, sat down and.


---
They made her restless, and
---
at last she said to herself:"?"


---
She looked again at Jude,.

---
as she
 had done so many times during the late months, and
---
she slipped from the room
---
which moved Arabella
---
She shut the front door, and

---
She entered under the archway of Oldgate College, where
 men were putting up awnings round the quadrangle for a ball in the
 hall that evening. 
---
Arabella walked along the
 gravel paths and under the aged limes. 
---
But finding this place rather
 dull she returned to the streets, and. 
---
closed, she moved on.


---
And
 Sue defiled!"


---
wherein I was born
---
Meanwhile Arabella, in her journey to discover,
. 
---
She nodded to one workman and another, and.


---
" I should not mind having a spin there with a fellow's arm round my
 waist," she said to one of the men. 
---
" But Lord, I must be getting
 home again
---
When she reached home
---
she was met at the door by Stagg, and one or
 two other of Jude's fellow stoneworkers. 
---
", thank you," said Arabella.


---
" I should like
---
to go," said she. 
---
" I've never seen the boat- racing,
 and
---
I hear."


---
" How I WISH!" 
---
I could
---
She looked longingly down the street. 
---
I'll just run up and. 
---
I believe;
---
so I can most likely come
---
she entered. 
---
When she reached the bedroom
---
she
 found.


---
she said impatiently. 
---
she brightened
---
However, on looking round to the bed, for she saw
. 
---
her to start
---
she
 went to the bed. 
---
She touched his fingers
---
She listened at his chest. 
---
After her first appalled sense of, the faint notes
 of a military or other brass band from the river reached her ears
---
;
 and in a provoked tone she exclaimed,"! 
---
she went to the door,.


---
" Here she is!
---
," she said
 hurriedly.


---
" Oh, I say-- how jolly! 
---
I'm glad I've come
---
," said Arabella. 
---
The blue flag of the boat club denoted the
 centre of interest, beneath which a band in red uniform gave out the
 notes she had already heard in the death- chamber. 
---
While she regarded the lively scene somebody touched
 Arabella in the ribs, and
---
looking round she saw Vilbert.


---
She did not reply. 
---
Vilbert's arm stole round her waist, which act
 could be performed unobserved in the crowd. 
---
she kept her
 eyes on the river.


---
as if she did not know of the embrace
---
she would have laughed heartily at the horse- play
 that succeeded, if the imprint on her mind's eye of a pale,
 statuesque countenance she had lately gazed upon had not sobered her
 a little.


---
," cried Arabella. 
---
Arabella exclaiming," Dear, dear!"
---
more and more
 impatiently; for it had just occurred to her mind.


---
"," said the physician, who, being
 pressed close against her by the throng, had no need of personal
 effort for contact. 
---
as she got up
 into the street Arabella
---
She did not go straight to her
 house; but to the abode of a woman who performed the last necessary
 offices for the poorer dead; where she knocked.


---
"," she said. 
---
Arabella waited a few minutes; and
---
the two women went along,.


---
" I must call at the sexton's about the bell, too
---
," said Arabella.

---
I'll meet you at my door.
---
" said she.


---
," said Arabella.


---
" murmured the old woman.


---
she
 will come
---
" she asked.


---
" I could not say. 
---
She swore.
---
" How is she looking?"


---
Years and years older than when
 you saw her last. 
---
-- she
 ca n't stomach un, even now!"


---
I offered, and
---
her know
---
she's found forgiveness
 somewhere
---
She said!


---
she had found peace
---
" She may swear that on her knees to the holy cross upon her necklace
, but
---
till she's hoarse
---
" said Arabella. 
---
She's

---
since she left his arms
---
she's!"
