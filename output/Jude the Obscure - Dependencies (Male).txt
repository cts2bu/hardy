The miller at Cresscombe lent him the small white tilted cart and
 horse to carry his goods to the city of his destination, about twenty
 miles off, such a vehicle proving of quite sufficient size for the
 departing teacher's effects. 
---
he had bought at an auction during the year in
 which
---
he thought of learning instrumental music
---
he had never acquired any skill in playing, and
---
the
 purchased article had been a perpetual trouble to him ever since in
 moving house
---
He did not mean.


---
even he got it into the cart
---
if he
 should not know,
 the city he was bound for,
---
he was only going into temporary
 lodgings just at first
---
A little boy of eleven, joined the group of men, and
---
as he
 spoke up,
---
a deputation should wait on the boy's aunt-- an
 old maiden resident-- and
---
the boy
 and the schoolmaster were left.


---
Tears rose into the boy's eyes, one who had attended the night school only during the present
 teacher's term of office. 
---
he was not among the regular day
 scholars, who came unromantically close to the schoolmaster's life,
 but
---
The boy awkwardly opened the book he held in his hand, which Mr.
 Phillotson had bestowed on him as a parting gift, and.


---
he was sorry
---
So said Mr. Phillotson.


---
It is the necessary hallmark of a man
 who wants to do anything in teaching. 
---
The smith and his companion returned. 
---
Old Miss Fawley's fuel- house
 was dry, and eminently practicable; and
---
The boy Jude assisted in loading some small articles, and.


---
Mr. Phillotson mounted beside his box of books and other
_ impedimenta_, and
---
he said,.

---
The boy returned to the draw- well at the edge
 of the greensward, where he had left his buckets when he went to help
 his patron and teacher in the loading. 
---
There was a quiver in his lip
 now and. 
---
to begin lowering the bucket he
 paused and
---
who has felt the
 pricks of life somewhat before his time
---
he was
 looking
---
He said to himself, in the melodramatic tones of a whimsical boy,
. 
---
him look down into it
---
when he was tired with his drawing
---
when he rested a bit before carrying the buckets home
---
he was too clever to bide here any longer-- a small sleepy place
 like this!"


---
A tear rolled from his eye into the depths of the well. 
---
the boy's breathing unfurled itself as
 a thicker fog upon the still and heavy air. 
---
His thoughts were

---
The boy quickly
 waved a signal of assent,.


---
what was a great effort
 for one of his stature,

II


 Slender was Jude Fawley's frame
---
as he bore the two brimming
 house- buckets of water to the cottage without resting. 
---
While emptying the buckets at the back of the house he could hear an
 animated conversation in progress within- doors between his great- aunt,
 the Drusilla of the sign- board, and some other villagers. 
---
's he?"
---
when the boy
 entered
---
He's my great- nephew." 
---
He come
 from Mellstock, down in South Wessex, about a year ago-- worse luck

---
where his father was living
---
Goddy- mighty had took thee too, wi' thy mother and father, poor
 useless boy
---
I've got him here. 
---
him earn any
 penny he can
---
Just now he's a- scaring of birds for Farmer Troutham.

---
It keeps him out of mischty. 
---
Miss Fawley doubted it.... 
---
I'm sure he could n't ha' took a
 better one. 
---
The boy is crazy for books,. 
---
he is
---
His cousin Sue is just the same--; but

---
Jude, finding the general attention again centering on himself went
 out to the bakehouse, where he ate the cake provided for his
 breakfast. 
---
The end of his spare time had now arrived, and. 
---
emerging
 from the garden by getting over the hedge at the back he pursued a
 path northward,
---
he came to a wide and lonely depression in the
 general level of the upland, which was sown as a corn- field
---
This
 vast concave was the scene of his labours for Mr Troutham the farmer,
 and
---
he descended into the midst of it.


---
The only marks on the
 uniformity of the scene were a rick of last year's produce standing
 in the midst of the arable, the rooks that rose at his approach, and
 the path athwart the fallow by which he had come, trodden now by he
 hardly knew whom, though once by many of his own dead family.


---
" he murmured.


---
many a man had made love- promises to
 a woman at whose voice he had trembled by the next seed- time after
 fulfilling them in the church adjoining
---
this neither Jude nor
 the rooks around him considered.
---
The boy stood under the rick before
---
He sounded the clacker. 
---
his heart
 grew sympathetic with the birds' thwarted desires
---
Why should
 he frighten them away? 
---
he could claim as
 being in the least degree interested in him, for his aunt
---
the aspect of
 gentle friends and pensioners-- had often
 told him. 
---
He ceased his rattling, and
---
said Jude, aloud. 
---
Puny and sorry as they much
 resembled his own.


---
he had by this time
---
His clacker thrown away from him, as being a mean
 and sordid instrument, offensive both to the birds and to himself
 as their friend. 
---
he became conscious of a smart blow
 upon his buttocks,. 
---
followed by a loud clack, which announced to his
 surprised senses that the clacker had been the instrument of offence
 used
---
the dazed
 eyes of the latter beheld the farmer in person, great Troutham
 himself, his red face glaring down upon Jude's cowering frame swinging in his hand.


---
Whilst saluting Jude's ears with this impassioned rhetoric had seized his left hand with his own left, and
---
cried the whirling child, as
 helpless under the centrifugal tendency of his person as a hooked
 fish swinging to land, and
---
the
 plantation, the path, and round him in an
 amazing circular race. "
---
Mr.
 Phillotson said
---
Jude had stoutly denied, and
---
he still
 smacked the whirling urchin, the clacks of
---
instrument continuing
 to resound all across the field and as far as the ears of distant
 workers-- who gathered thereupon that Jude was pursuing his business
 of clacking with great assiduity-- and
---
Presently Troutham grew tired of his punitive task, and,.


---
him see him in one of those fields again
---
Jude leaped out of arm's reach, and
---
he had wholly disgraced himself
---
he had been a year
 in the parish, and
---
he did not care, and. 
---
Here he beheld scores of coupled earthworms
. 
---
Farmer Troutham had just hurt him
---
Though he was a boy who could not
 himself bear to hurt anything. 
---
He had never brought home a nest of
 young birds without lying awake in misery half the night after, and
. 
---
He could scarcely bear. 
---
he was the sort of man who was born to ache a good deal before
 the fall of the curtain upon his unnecessary life
---
all was well with him again
---
He carefully picked his way on tiptoe
 among the earthworms, without killing a single one.


---
he found
---
He threw the sixpence tragically on the table.

" Ah!"
---
His father was my
 father's journeyman, anyhow, and
---
Where is this beautiful city, Aunt-- this place where Mr. Phillotson
 is gone to
---
will Mr. Phillotson always be there?"


---
Jude went out, and,
---
feeling more than ever his existence to be an
 undemanded one he lay down upon his back on a heap of litter near
 the pig- sty. 
---
He pulled his
 straw hat over his face, and. 
---
Growing up
 brought responsibilities he found. 
---
quite he had thought
---
Nature's logic was too horrid for him to care for.

---
As felt, he perceived. 
---
he could only prevent himself! 
---
He did not want.


---
Then he forgot his despondency, and.

---
he helped his aunt, and
---
he went into the
 village. 
---
Here he asked
---
The man pointed north- eastward, in the very direction where lay that
 field in which Jude had so disgraced himself. 
---
the fearsomeness
 of this fact rather increased his curiosity about the city. 
---
he was;
---
So stealing out of the hamlet he descended into the same hollow which
 had witnessed his punishment in the morning. 
---
all before him was bleak
 open down.




---
The boy had never before strayed so far north as this from the
 nestling hamlet in which he had been deposited by the carrier from a
 railway station southward, one dark evening some few months earlier,
 and
---
he had had no suspicion that such a wide, flat,
 low- lying country lay so near at hand, under the very verge of his
 upland world. 
---
The whole northern semicircle between east and west,
 to a distance of forty or fifty miles, spread itself before him; a
 bluer, moister atmosphere, evidently, than that he breathed up here.


---
He was about to pass it; and the reflection that the higher he got, the further he
 could see, led Jude to stand and regard it. 
---
when he perceived a ladder against
 the eaves
---
two men were repairing the tiling. 
---
He turned into the ridgeway and
.


---
When he had wistfully watched the workmen for some time he took
 courage, and.


---
he stood beside them
---
The other tiler, glad of any kind of diversion from the monotony of
 his labour had also turned.

---
" he said. 
---
The boy strained his eyes also; yet. 
---
neither could he see the far- off
 city
---
He descended from the barn, and
---
he walked along the ridge- track,. 
---
When he repassed the barn
---
to go back to Marygreen he
 observed.


---
the men had

---
He thought again of Christminster, and
,,. 
---
he had come two or three miles from his aunt's house
 on purpose
---
he could have seen for
---
even he waited here
---
Yet he was loth.


---
He ascended the ladder. 
---
the men
 had designated, and
---
He might not be able to come so far as this for many
 days. 
---
he prayed
---
He had read in a tract that
 a man who had begun to build a church, and
---
Another man tried the same experiment, and but
---
he found afterwards. 
---
he knelt in
---
Jude knelt on the third rung, where, resting against those above it,
 he prayed that the mist might rise.


---
He then seated himself again, and. 
---
The
 boy immediately looked back in the old direction.


---
Turning to the west he saw. 
---
He anxiously descended the ladder, and
---
the corpses round him
---
He knew, yet
---
he had grown out of belief in
 these horrors
---
he was glad,, and
---
when he saw the church tower and the
 lights in the cottage windows
---
even this was not the home of
 his birth
---
a strong
 man could have carried
---
Inside and round about that old woman's" shop" window, with its
 twenty- four little panes set in lead- work, the glass of some of
 them oxidized with age, so that forming part of a stock which Jude had for some long
 tideless time. 
---
his dreams were as gigantic as his surroundings
.


---
northward
 he was always beholding a gorgeous city--
---
he had

---
there was perhaps more of the
 painter's imagination and less of the diamond merchant's in his
 dreams thereof than in those of the Apocalyptic writer. 
---
the city
 acquired a tangibility, a permanence, a hold on his life, mainly from
 the one nucleus of fact
---
he had so much reverence
---
the man for whose knowledge and purposes
 was actually living there
---
he knew
---
In sad wet seasons, though he could hardly believe. 
---
Whenever
 he could get away from the confines of the hamlet for an hour or two,

---
, he strain his eyes persistently sometimes to be rewarded by
 the sight of a dome or spire, at other times by a little smoke, which
 in his estimate had some of the mysticism of incense.


---
when it suddenly occurred to him
---
he
 ascended to the point of view after dark, or
---
if possibly went a mile or
 two further he would see the night lights of the city
---
even that consideration did not
 deter him,.


---
he could throw a little manliness into his mood, no
 doubt
---
when he arrived at
 the place of outlook
---
He was rewarded; but
---
he saw
---
he had half expected
---
He set himself--
---
he
 seemed.


---
Phillotson promenading at ease
---
He had heard and
---
the fact now came into his mind. 
---
He parted his lips, and.


---
he faced
 the north- east
---
You he said,"
---
being breathed by him
---
Suddenly there came along this wind something towards him-- a message
 from the place-- from some soul residing there
---
He had become and. 
---
he paused a team of horses
.

---
They were elderly men, and. 
---
Jude addressed them,
.


---
He was getting
---
alluding to his mistress he felt bashful at mentioning its name
 again. 
---
He pointed to the light in the sky-- hardly perceptible to
 their older eyes.

"
---
Jude had tucked up under his arm
---
The carter eyed him.


---
he picked
 it up and
---
he observed,
---
though to turn a lirruping hobble- de- hoy chap into a solemn
 preaching man with no corrupt passions they'll do it,.... 
---
Now do n't you interrupt, my boy. 
---
As so be they
 in their minds-- noble- minded men enough, no doubt-- some on' em-- able
 to earn hundreds by thinking out loud. 
---
Jude, throwing a last adoring look at the distant
 halo, turned and. 
---
who had no objection to telling him as they moved on more yet of
 the city-- its towers and halls and churches
---
whereupon Jude thanked the carter warmly for his
 information, and
---
he only wished
---
he could talk half as well about
 Christminster as he
---
when he
 was in his prime
---
why I knowed un as well as my own brother in his
 later years
---
Jude continued his walk homeward alone,. 
---
he forgot
---
He suddenly grew older. 
---
It had been the
 yearning of his heart. 
---
he could call admirable
---
Should he find
 that place in this city?
---
he could get there
---
he could
 watch and? 
---
he had heard
---
the halo had been to his eyes

---
he pursued his dark way
---
he said to himself.


---
he added a few steps further on.


---
It is a place that teachers of men spring from and."


---
he was silent
---
After this figure he added:

."

IV


 Walking somewhat slowly by reason of his concentration was overtaken by a light- footed pedestrian
---
he could perceive
---
he, indeed took care
---
Cottagers
 formed his only patients, and
---
his Wessex- wide repute was among them
 alone. 
---
His position was humbler and his field more obscure than
 those of the quacks with capital and an organized system of
 advertising. 
---
He was, in fact, a survival. 
---
he
 traversed on foot
---
Jude had
---
him selling a pot of
 coloured lard to an old woman as a certain cure for a bad leg, the
 woman arranging to pay a guinea, in instalments of a shilling a
 fortnight, for the precious salve, which, according to the physician,
 could only be obtained from a particular animal which grazed on
 Mount Sinai,
---
he already had his doubts about this gentleman's
 medicines
---
Jude though felt and
 one who might be a trustworthy source of information on matters not
 strictly professional.


---
him to be unquestionably a travelled personage,
---
replied the long thin man. 
---
so my boy'd seen it
---
that's more for the men who are in training for bishops
---
" to meet you said Jude.


---
Jude then dropped behind,.


---
he ran about and.


---
they were people meeting and nodding to
 him
---
He honestly performed his promise to the man of many cures, in whom
 he now sincerely believed,. 
---
he stood motionless on the plateau, at the place
 where he had parted from Vilbert, and
---
The road- physician was fairly up to time; but, to the surprise of
 Jude on striking into his pace,
---
Jude thought, and
---
it might perhaps be owing to his
 wearing another hat
---
he saluted the physician with dignity.


---
Well, my boy?" said the latter abstractedly.


---
said Jude.


---
Jude told him the names and addresses of the cottagers
 who were willing to test the virtues of the world- renowned pills and
 salve. 
---
Jude's voice trembled with
 anxiety.

"
---
Jude controlled himself sufficiently long;
 and
---
he repeated, in a voice of dry misery,"
---
Jude dropped behind. 
---
He was an unsophisticated boy, but
---
The leaves dropped from
 his imaginary crown of laurel
---
he turned to a gate, leant against it,
 and.


---
He
 might perhaps have obtained grammars from Alfredston, but; and
 though physically comfortable
---
,, to do
, and a knowledge of what books to order he was in such absolute dependence as
.


---
Mr. Phillotson sent for his pianoforte, and
---
Why should he not write to the schoolmaster, and? 
---
He might
 slip a letter inside the case of the instrument, and
---
To tell his aunt of his intention would be. 
---
he did act
---
Jude waited days and weeks, every morning at the cottage post office. 
---
he
 saw from the ends of it. 
---
He took it
 away into a lonely place, and.


---
Ever his first ecstasy or vision of Christminster and its
 possibilities had meditated much and curiously on the probable
 sort of process that was involved in turning the expressions of one
 language into those of another. 
---
He concluded. 
---
a grammar of the
 required tongue would contain, primarily, a rule, prescription, or
 clue of the nature of a secret cipher, which, once known, would
 enable him, by merely applying it, to change at will all words of his
 own speech into those of the foreign one
---
His childish idea was, in
 fact,. 
---
Thus he assumed.


---
When, therefore, having noted that he cut the string,
---
, opened the volumes, and turned to
 the Latin grammar, to come uppermost he could scarcely
 believe his eyes.


---
The book was an old one-- thirty years old, soiled, scribbled
 wantonly over with a strange name in every variety of enmity to the
 letterpress, and marked at random with dates twenty years earlier
 than his own day. 
---
this was not the cause of Jude's amazement.

---
He learnt for the first time.


---
as in his innocence he had supposed
---
Jude flung down the books,. 
---
he had often done before
---
As he pulled his hat over his
 face and. 
---
the sun peering insidiously at him through the
 interstices of the straw
---
he had supposed in store
---
he
 presently thought,
---
There were no brains in his head equal to this business; and
---
as to stream in through his hat at him he
 wished.


---
he had never seen a book,,

---
he might never see another
---
he had never been born
---
Somebody might have come along that way who would have asked him his
 trouble, and. 
---
his notions were
 further advanced than those of his grammarian
---
Jude continued.




---
his disappointment at the nature of those
 tongues had, after a while,
---
he now knew them

---
To acquire languages,
 departed or living in spite of such obstinacies as inherently to possess, was a herculean performance which gradually
 led him on to a greater interest in it than in the presupposed patent
 process. 
---
The mountain- weight of material under which piqued him into a dogged,
 mouselike subtlety of attempt to move it piecemeal.


---
He had endeavoured, and
---
An
 aged horse with a hanging head had been purchased for eight pounds at
 a sale, a creaking cart with a whity- brown tilt obtained for a few
 pounds more, and in this turn- out it became Jude's business thrice a
 week to carry loaves of bread to the villagers and solitary cotters
 immediately round Marygreen.


---
The singularity aforesaid lay, after all, less in the conveyance
 itself than in Jude's manner of conducting it along its route.

---
Its interior was the scene of most of Jude's education by" private
 study." 
---
he was
---
As soon as the houses
 at which to pause awhile would
 slip the reins over his arm, ingeniously fix open, by means of a
 strap attached to the tilt
---
he was reading
---
the volume spread the
 dictionary on his knees, and and with an expenditure of labour that would have made
 a tender- hearted pedagogue she d tears;.


---
he read, and
---
which often to his mind was something else
 than that which he was taught to look for
---
he had been able to lay hands on
---
they were passably
 good for him
---
he would have used a comrade or tutor who should
 have happened to be passing by
---
Jude may have had little
 chance of becoming a scholar by these rough and ready means
---
though he was
 in the way of getting into the groove he wished to follow.


---
he was busied with these ancient pages,
---
so remote yet so near the bony old horse pursued
 his rounds, and
---
Jude would be aroused from the woes of Dido by the
 stoppage of his cart and the voice of
---
He was frequently met in the lanes by pedestrians and others without
 his seeing them, and by degrees,
---
his reading to be
---
the
 baker's boy should not be allowed, and
---
him fined for
 dangerous practices on the highway
---
The policeman thereupon lay in
 wait for Jude, and
---
Jude had
---
he distributed later in the
 day
---
As to get up at three o'clock in the morning to heat the
 oven, and mix and set in the bread that he was obliged. 
---
he could not read his classics on the highways

---
if he could hardly study at all
---
he
 could
---
To do
 official justice he did not put himself much in the way of
 Jude's bread- cart,.


---
the
 chief danger was to Jude himself, and often on seeing the white tilt
 over the hedges he would move in another direction
---
when Fawley was getting quite advanced,, and
---
being now about
 sixteen had been stumbling through the" Carmen Sæculare," on
 his way home he found. 
---
himself to be passing over the high edge of
 the plateau by the Brown House
---
it was
 the sense of this which had caused him to look up. 
---
His mind had become so impregnated with the
 poem
---
him to kneel on the ladder
---
, in a moment of the same impulsive emotion which he stopped the horse,
. 
---
He turned first to the
 shiny goddess, who seemed to look so softly and critically at his
 doings, then to the disappearing luminary on the other hand,:


""



---
he
 began
---
he had finished the hymn, which Jude
 repeated under the sway of a polytheistic fancy that he would never
 have thought of humouring in broad daylight
---
Reaching home he mused over his curious superstition, innate or
 acquired, in doing this, and. 
---
he thought of it
---
he was of his inconsistency
---
He began. 
---
he could be reading quite the right books for his object
 in life
---
Ultimately he decided. 
---
he had taken
 up a wrong emotion for a Christian young man
---
He had dabbled in
 Clarke's Homer, but. 
---
he possessed a copy
---
He abandoned the now familiar Ionic for a
 new dialect, and
---
Moreover he was introduced to patristic
 literature by finding at the bookseller's some volumes of the
 Fathers which had been left behind by an insolvent clergyman of the
 neighbourhood.


---
he visited on Sundays all
 the churches within a walk, and. 
---
he
 met with a hunch- backed old woman of great intelligence, who read
 everything she could lay her hands on
---
he
 resolved as firmly as ever to go.


---
he had no income at all. 
---
He
 had no trade or calling of any dignity or stability.


---
he could subsist
---
he felt a distaste; the preparation of the
 third requisite he inclined to. 
---
therefore he
 would learn. 
---
He thought of his unknown uncle, his cousin
 Susanna's father, an ecclesiastical worker in metal, and
---
somehow
 mediæval art in any material was a trade for which he had rather a
 fancy. 
---
He could not go far wrong in following his uncle's footsteps,
 and.


---
he obtained some small blocks of freestone,.


---
he had found a substitute for himself in his aunt's little
 business
---
as
 soon as he offered his services to this man for a trifling wage.

---
Here Jude had the opportunity of learning at least the rudiments of
 freestone- working. 
---
Some time later he went to a church- builder in
 the same place, and
---
he was only following up this handicraft as
 a prop to lean on
---
he prepared those greater engines which
 he flattered himself would be better fitted for him
---
Not forgetting that while he yet was
 interested in his pursuit on its own account. 
---
He now had lodgings
 during the week in the little town,. 
---
he returned to Marygreen
 village every Saturday evening
---
thus he reached and.




---
he was, one Saturday,.

---
he walked with his
 tools at his back, his little chisels clinking faintly against the
 larger ones in his basket. 
---
he had left
 work early, and
---
He was in an enthusiastic mood. 
---
He seemed, and
. 
---
he had dreamed so much
---
He might have gone there
 now, in some capacity or other, but
---
he preferred. 
---
he could be said
---
A warm self- content suffused him. 
---
when he considered

---
he had already done
---
then he went along
---
Now as he turned
. 
---
he hardly
 saw them.


---
the act was an automatic repetition of what he had been
 accustomed to do when less occupied; and
---
which really
 engaged him
---
the one matter was the mental estimate of his progress thus far
---
Jude possessing a facility in that language which enabled him with
 great ease to himself to beguile his lonely walks by imaginary
 conversations therein.


---
I have read two books of the_ Iliad_, besides being pretty familiar
 with passages such as the speech of Phoenix in the ninth book,
 the fight of Hector and Ajax in the fourteenth, the appearance of
 Achilles unarmed and his heavenly armour in the eighteenth, and the
 funeral games in the twenty- third.
---
then he continued, and. 
---
he might become even a
 bishop by leading a pure, energetic, wise, Christian life
---
he would set! 
---
his income were£5000 a year
---
If he would
 give away£4500 in one form and another, and. 
---
He would draw the line at an archdeacon. 
---
Perhaps a man
 could be as good and. 
---
he thought of the bishop again.

"
---
he did not notice them.

---
His thoughts went on:

"--Euripides, Plato, Aristotle, Lucretius, Epictetus, Seneca,
 Antoninus. 
---
he was now standing quite still,. 
---
sudden something smacked him sharply in the ear, and

---
he became aware.


---
a soft cold substance had been flung at him, and

---
A glance told him. 
---
he now had come the slight sounds of voices and
 laughter that had mingled with his dreams. 
---
He mounted the bank and
. 
---
his attention had at
---
he was watching them
---
" Thank you!" said Jude severely.


---
I do n't care for him!" 
---
Jude grew sarcastic, and.


---
he wiped his face
---
he said to the up- stream one of the three.


---
he addressed
---
Jude was almost certain that to her was
 attributable the enterprise of attracting his attention from dreams
 of the humaner letters to what was simmering in the minds around him.


---
somehow or other the eyes
 of the brown girl rested in his own
---
when he had said the words, and

---
Jude
 Fawley was concerned
---
he had singled her out from the three,
---
unconsciously received by unfortunate men
---
Jude was now aware that no message on any matter connected with her
 father's business had prompted her signal to him. 
---
He set down his
 basket of tools,. 
---
Jude tossing back her
 missile seemed.


---
We are doing this for my father,. 
---
He makes that into dubbin." 
---
Jude asked,
,.

" Impudence. 
---
he had very large doubts as
 to its truth
---
My father is a pig- breeder, and
---
The
 unvoiced call of woman to man, held Jude to the spot against his
 intention-- almost against his will, and in a way new to his
 experience. 
---
Jude had never looked at a woman, but

---
He gazed from her eyes to her mouth, thence to her bosom, and.


---
he murmured,.


---
he answered

". 
---
Jude felt, but. "
---
himself drifting strangely
---
Jude being still unconscious of more than
 a general impression of her appearance
---
he hazarded.

---
Jude Fawley shouldered his tool- basket and. 
---
he mentally stood at gaze
---
He had

---
a single breath from a new atmosphere, evidently been hanging round him everywhere he went, for he knew not
 how long, but had somehow been divided from his actual breathing as
 by a sheet of glass
---
he had
---
he knew not
 how.

"
---
he said to himself, faintly conscious
. 
---
who had
 drawn him to her
---
still he should assert mere
 sportiveness on his part as his reason in seeking her-- something in
 her quite antipathetic to that side of him which had been occupied
 with literary study and the magnificent Christminster dream
---
who chose THAT missile for opening her attack on him
---
He saw this with his intellectual eye, just for a short fleeting
 while, as by the light of a falling lamp
---
Jude was lost to
 all conditions of things in the advent of a fresh and wild pleasure,
 that of having found a new channel for emotional interest hitherto
 unsuspected, though it had lain close beside him. 
---
He was.


---
he's nobody,. 
---
He used. 
---
he prenticed
 himself at Alfredston
---
he's been and
. 
---
He wants
---
he is,
---
Whether whether
 he's as simple as a child. 
---
when he looked at' ee
---
he had never seen a woman
 before in his born days
---
he's."




---
to be had by any woman who can
 get him to care for her a bit, if she likes to set herself to catch
 him the right way
---
Jude Fawley was pausing in his bedroom with the sloping
 ceiling,.


---
made by the smoke of his lamp in past
 months
---
It was Sunday afternoon, four- and- twenty hours after his meeting with
 Arabella Donn. 
---
he had been resolving
---
He was proud of the book,
.


---
he had never done before
---
He had anticipated much pleasure in this afternoon's reading, under
 the quiet roof of his great- aunt's house
---
where he now
 slept only two nights a week. 
---
a new thing, a great hitch, had
 happened yesterday in the gliding and noiseless current of his life,
 and
---
he felt as a snake, and.


---
He would not go out, after all. 
---
He sat down,
---
his hands
 to his temples began at the beginning:


   
---
Had he promised? 
---
Surely he had! 
---
He ought. 
---
Even he had

---
though he could afford one
 afternoon,. 
---
other young men afforded so many
---
he would never probably see her again. 
---
his plans were
---
if materially a compelling arm of extraordinary
 muscular power seized hold of him-- something which had nothing in
 common with the spirits and influences that had moved him hitherto.

---
he has seized by the collar, in a direction
 which tended towards the embrace of a woman for whom he had no
 respect, and whose life had nothing in common with his own except
 locality.



---
Foreseeing such an event he had

---
he was
 out of the house and.


---
he walked
---
As he looked at his watch. 
---
He could be back in two hours,
 easily, and
---
a good long time would still remain to him for reading
 after tea.


---
where the path
 joined the highway he hastened along
---
Here at the base of the chalk formation he neared the brook
 that oozed from it, and. 
---
he reached her

---
He entered the garden, and.


---
Somebody had seen him through the window, for a male voice on! 
---
Here's your young man
---
Courting in such a businesslike aspect the last thing he was thinking
 of. 
---
He was going
---
he entered,.


---
Take a chair said her father, an energetic,
 black- whiskered man, in the same businesslike tones Jude had heard
 from outside.


---
said he. 
---
he felt
 glad he had come, and
---
that had hitherto
 haunted him
---
he had. 
---
Then
 they bore off to the left along the crest into the ridgeway, which
 they followed till it intersected the high- road at the Brown
 House aforesaid, the spot of his former fervid desires to behold
 Christminster. 
---
he forgot them now. 
---
He talked the commonest
 local twaddle to Arabella with greater zest than he would have felt
 in discussing all the philosophies with all the Dons in the recently
 adored university, and. 
---
where he had knelt to Diana
 and Phoebus without remembering that there were any such people in
 the mythology, or that the sun was anything else than a useful
 lamp for illuminating Arabella's face
---
An indescribable lightness
 of heel served; and Jude, the incipient scholar,
 prospective D.D., professor, bishop, or what not, felt himself
 honoured and glorified by the condescension of this handsome country
 wench in agreeing to take a walk with him in her Sunday frock and
 ribbons.


---
They reached the Brown House barn-- the point at which he had planned
 to turn back. 
---
which had grown up in Jude's bosom
---
The tenderness left him--. 
---
which pleased him in affording him excuse
 for a longer time with her
---
The maid- servant recognized Jude, and
. 
---
he,
 should have suddenly
 descended so low
---
the
 unfortunate wayfarer finds himself with no other haven of rest.


---
Jude wished but.


---
he was out of such an
 uncongenial atmosphere;
---
he ordered the beer,
---
Jude tasted. 
---
" What he asked. 
---
he said good- humouredly.


---
why he did not put his
 arm
---
he did not merely said."


---
what to himself
 seemed a quite bold enough thing:" Take my arm
---
He felt the warmth of
 her body against his, and.


---
" he observed.


---
he was thinking.


---
Before nearly run into by two men who had been
 walking on the grass unseen.


---
" These lovers-- said one of the men as
 they vanished down the hill.


---
Jude took the
 hint, and,.


---
, what since said Jude
 to himself. 
---
he kissed her again. 
---
he kissed her once more.


---
He did so,.


---
He had left his cottage
 at half- past three,. 
---
when he stood
---
He gave
 way, and. 
---
he
 found, in addition to her parents,
---
They did not belong to his set or circle, and
---
he felt out of place
 and embarrassed. 
---
He had not meant this: a mere afternoon of
 pleasant walking with Arabella, that was all he had meant. 
---
He did

---
He walked. 
---
he felt himself
---
were his books to him?
---
were
 his intentions,
---
he was just living for the first
 time
---
When he got back to the house
---
a general
 consciousness of his neglect seemed written on the face of all things
 confronting him. 
---
He went upstairs without a light, and
---
the dim
 interior of his room accosted him with sad inquiry. 
---
There lay his
 book open,
---
just he had left it, and
---
the capital letters on the
 title- page regarded him with fixed reproach in the grey starlight,
 like the unclosed eyes of a dead man:


   
---
as Jude had; and
---
it was with a sense of futility that he threw into his
 basket upon his tools and other necessaries the unread book.


---
he had

---
He kept his impassioned doings a secret almost from himself.

---
Retracing by the light of dawn the road he had followed a few hours
 earlier under cover of darkness, with his sweetheart by his side
---
he
 reached the bottom of the hill, where he walked slowly, and. 
---
He was on the spot where he had given her the first kiss. 
---
Jude looked on the ground and. 
---
He looked
 closely, and. 
---
a void was in his heart

---
he could
 see her again
---
he had promised
---
his intensest wish

---
he had had only the week to live
---
did he tell'?"


---
Then he said--" 
---
Jude had been behind the fence
---
If he would have

---
him to care for' ee a bit,' nation
---
him to care for me
---
him to have me--
---
I
 must have him. 
---
I ca n't do without him. 
---
He's the sort of man I long
 for. 
---
I ca n't give myself to him altogether
---
when I first saw him
---
he is a romancing, straightfor'ard, honest chap
---
As he's and. 
---
you set about catching him in the right way.
---
that is, than by plain courting,
 and taking care he do n't go too far!
---
how do you mean-- a sure way to gain a man? 
---
he forbid
---
he ISN'T honourable
---
Besides you make sure that he's
 honourable before you begin. 
---
VIII


 One week's end Jude was
---
which now had large
 attractions for him quite other than his desire to see his aged and
 morose relative
---
He diverged to the right before ascending the hill
 with the single purpose of gaining, on his way,.

---
his alert eye perceived.

---
Entering the gate he found. 
---
They were drove from Spaddleholt
 Farm only yesterday, where Father bought'em at a stiff price enough.

---
There are no men
 folk at home, only Mother, and they'll be lost if we do n't mind."


---
He set himself, and. 
---
when he caught her for a moment and
---
He plunged
 through a hole in the garden hedge, and into the lane.

"
---
He'll be lost!"
---
Occasionally they
 would shout to some boy, but
---
he always wriggled
 past and.


---
Let said Jude. 
---
the pig had reached an unfastened gate admitting to the
 open down, across which he sped with all the agility his little legs
 afforded. 
---
he could be seen as a minute speck,.


---
He'll be there long. 
---
he's not lost or
---
He reclined on his elbow near her.


---
Nobody could be nearer than a mile
 to them without their seeing him. 
---
Jude did not think of
 that then.


---
Jude sitting up
---
You ca n't see him there--
---
He bent nearer and. 
---
" No-- he said.


---
" he repeated, the back of his head against her
 cheek. 
---
He stood accordingly,
.


---
he replied. 
---
Jude followed and.


---
he coaxed.

"
---
Jude followed her
 like a pet lamb. 
---
he tried or
---
Thus they descended
 to the precincts of her father's homestead, and
---
Jude said to
 himself,.


---
he withdrew with a sigh and
---
Her father was shaving before a little glass. 
---
He's for Christminster
---
I hear, as soon as he can get there."


---
it is his plan
---
He's

---
he must walk about with
 somebody
---
Young men do n't mean much now- a- days.'
---
He's shy; and. 
---
him slip through my
 fingers
---
Jude assented. 
---
he was near her
---
So long as he minded little where he
 was. 
---
he said lingeringly:". 
---
Jude being
---
Did he want any tea? 
---
No, he
 would rather sit and. 
---
" he said,.


---
he could quite reach her

---
Jude making a plunge for
 it and
---
he flushed also
---
They looked at each other,; till he rose and said:" One kiss,
 now I can do it without damage to property; and I'll go!"


---
being small he could not discover for a long
 time what had become of her, till a laugh
---
he left her
---
he said to her. 
---
he asked,. 
---
he went out alone, and.

---
He knew well, too well, in the secret centre of his brain,.

---
such being the custom of the rural districts among honourable
 young men who had drifted so far into intimacy with a woman as he
 unfortunately had done
---
Yet he was ready to abide by what he had said,
 and take the consequences. 
---
he kept up a
 factitious belief in her. 
---
His idea of her was the thing of most
 consequence,
---
not Arabella herself he sometimes said laconically.


---
All his
 reading had only come to this,. 
---
he would have
---
it was the sort of
 conduct they would have expected of such an honest young man
---
Jude
 in reparation of the wrong he had done his innocent sweetheart
---
it was the last thing she could do for him, poor silly
 fellow
---
if, instead of his
 living to trouble her he had gone underground years before with his
 father and mother
---
He was working for half wages till
. 
---
he should be out of his time
---
where he had considered
---
him to take a lonely roadside cottage between
 the Brown House and Marygreen
---
he might have the profits of a
 vegetable garden, and
---
it was not the sort of life he had bargained for,
 and
---
;
 that was the thing-- a husband with a lot
 of earning power in him for buying her frocks and hats when he should
 begin to get frightened a bit, and.


---
he took her on the evening of the marriage,--.


---
A little chill overspread him at her first unrobing. 
---
he had bought her
---
What-- he said, with a sudden distaste for her.


---
the men expect more,
 and
---
Jude thought with a feeling of sickness that though this might be
 true to some extent, for all that he knew, many unsophisticated girls
 would and did go to towns and remain there for years without losing
 their simplicity of life and embellishments. 
---
he resolved.


---
Mrs. Jude Fawley was walking in the streets of
 Alfredston one market- day with this quality in her carriage.


---
I knew it would with such as him. 
---
He's a dear good fellow,
 and
---
said Mrs. Fawley quietly.


---
he be in a taking! 
---
He'll give it to' ee o' Saturday
 nights! 
---
he'll say
---
he wo n't
 care! 
---
He'll be glad I was wrong in what I said. 
---
He'll shake down,

---
men always do. 
---
they were in their
 chamber in the lonely cottage by the wayside to which Jude walked
 home from his work every day. 
---
He had worked hard the whole twelve
 hours, and. 
---
he lay
---
One action of hers however brought him to full cognition. 
---
Her face
 being reflected towards him. 
---
as he could perceive
---
It seemed to him for
 the first time.


---
the dimples were far oftener absent from her face
 during his intercourse with her nowadays
---
he said suddenly. 
---
Most men think otherwise."


---
most men think
---
you had always lived in
 your father's house
---
He sat bolt upright in bed and. 
---
He gave the answer simply, and and
---
When Jude awoke the next morning
---
he seemed. 
---
he was compelled
---
As to the point in question to
 accept her word he could not have acted
 otherwise. 
---
There seemed to him, vaguely and dimly, something wrong in a social
 ritual which made necessary a cancelling of well- formed schemes
 involving years of thought and labour, of foregoing a man's one
 opportunity of showing himself superior to the lower animals, and of
 contributing his units of work to the general progress of his
 generation, because of a momentary surprise by a new and transitory
 instinct which had nothing in it of the nature of vice, and
---
He was inclined to inquire what he
 had done, or
---
he deserved
---
which would cripple him, if not her also, for the rest of a
 lifetime
---
There was perhaps something fortunate in the fact that the
 immediate reason of his marriage had proved to be non- existent. 
---
Jude and his wife had
 fattened in their sty during the autumn months,
---
Jude might get to Alfredston without losing more than a quarter
 of a day
---
Jude looked out of the window
 long before dawn, and.


---
he said to
 Arabella.


---
he'll come. 
---
Challow to scald him
---
said Jude. 
---
He went downstairs,;
---
He's

---
The snow is not enough to
 hinder him, surely!"


---
He ate yesterday morning."

" Yesterday morning? 
---
has he lived on since?"


---
he has been starving?"


---
That accounts for his crying so. 
---
However his basket
 have been already sent on here, and
---
said Jude. 
---
He went out to the sty,. 
---
Jude, got into the sty, and. 
---
Jude
 held him
---
Upon my soul than have had
 this to do said Jude. 
---
I'll stick him effectually,. 
---
he must die slow
---
He ought."


---
He shall not be half a minute
---
if, said Jude determinedly. 
---
he had seen
---
Scraping the bristles from the pig's
 upturned throat, as he slit the fat
---
his glazing eyes riveting themselves on
 Arabella with the eloquently keen reproach of a creature recognizing
 at last the treachery of those who had seemed his only friends.


---
Picking up the knife from the ground whereon
 Jude had flung it
---
his dying breath coming
 through the hole
---
said he.


---
now he'll go
---
he kicked over the vessel in which the blood
 had been caught.

"
---
Jude put the pail upright, but
---
The lips and
 nostrils of the animal turned livid, then white, and the muscles of
 his limbs relaxed.


---
Jude said. 
---
He's dead."


---
said he. 
---
Challow expressed his contrition. 
---
he said,,"
---
Jude too laughed, but
---
there was a strong flavour of bitterness in
 his amusement.


---
Challow made up for his neglect of the killing by zeal in the
 scalding and scraping. 
---
Jude felt dissatisfied with himself as a man
 at what he had done, though aware of his lack of common sense, and
. 
---
The white snow, stained with the blood of his fellow- mortal wore an illogical look to him as a lover of justice; but
---
he could not see. 
---
he was,
---
He did not like the road to Alfredston now. 
---
It stared him cynically
 in the face. 
---
The wayside objects reminded him so much of his
 courtship of his wife
---
he
 read. 
---
whenever he could walked to and from his work
---
he sometimes felt that by caring for books he was not escaping
 common- place nor gaining rare ideas, every working- man being of that
 taste now. 
---
he had

---
he heard voices. 
---
just he had
 done at that earlier time
---
possibly they had seen him in the
 distance
---
They were quite unaware that the shed- walls were so thin
 that he could hear their words as he passed.


---
I had n't'd no more have been his mis'ess
---
he should
 make her his" mis'ess," otherwise wife
---
it rankled in his mind so much that instead of
 entering his own cottage when he reached it he flung his basket
 inside the garden- gate and passed on, determined to go and see his
 old aunt and get some supper there.


---
This made his arrival home rather late. 
---
he
 had heard
---
Dreading should lead him. 
---
he
 spoke little
---
he ought
---
he said hastily. 
---
he hinted gently.

---
what had been revealed to him
---
he is honest, or herself
---
which
 entraps a man if is otherwise
---
Leave my books alone he said. 
---
Somehow he loosened the fastening of her hair,
 and
---
Jude relinquished his hold, and
---
he had caused
---
dressed in their holiday
 clothes they were mainly lovers-- such pairs as Jude and Arabella
 had been when they sported along the same track some months earlier.

---
how he's served me
---
Jude was exasperated, and.

---
Then he suddenly lost his heat. 
---
he stood still,. 
---
he
 thought.

"
---
your father ill used your
 mother, and
---
your father's sister ill used her husband
---
Jude fixed an arrested, surprised look on her. 
---
He left the spot, and,
. 
---
Here he called upon his great- aunt
---
-- my father ill use my mother, and my aunt her husband?"

---
Jude abruptly, sitting down by the fire
---
Your father and mother could n't get on together, and
---
your
 father went away with you to South Wessex, and."


---
Jude recalled his father's silence about North Wessex and Jude's
 mother,.


---
It was the same with your father's sister. 
---
Her husband offended
 her, and
---
did Father and Mother part-- by the Brown House
---
Jude walked away from his old aunt's as
. 
---
he reached the open down
---
as soon as he struck out
 upon it. 
---
he came to a large round pond
---
Jude put one foot on the edge of the
 ice, and
---
then the other it cracked under his weight; but. 
---
He ploughed his way inward to the centre,. 
---
he went
---
When he looked
 around him and. 
---
he did

---
He jumped again, but
---
Jude
 went back to the edge, and.


---
he thought. 
---
was he reserved for? 
---
He supposed
. 
---
he was not a sufficiently dignified person for suicide
---
Peaceful
 death abhorred him as a subject, and.


---
could he do of a lower kind than self- extermination
---
He could get drunk. 
---
he had forgotten.

---
He began. 
---
why some men boozed at inns
---
He
 struck down the hill northwards and.

---
him to recognize the place
---
he
 had visited with Arabella on that first Sunday evening of their
 courtship
---
He called for liquor and.


---
Staggering homeward late that night, with all his sense of
 depression gone, and
---
his head fairly clear still he began. 
---
when he entered, and
---
he could get a light
---
Then he found.

---
written by his wife on the inside of an old envelope
---
he remained at home, and. 
---
He then cleaned up the premises,.


---
when he again plodded home
---
he found. 
---
He was such
 a slow old coach, and
---
There was no prospect of his ever bettering himself or her.

---
he knew, for
 some time
---
he had no
 objection
---
Jude replied. 
---
he had not the least objection to her going
---
He
 thought it a wise course, and one that might
 be to the advantage of both. 
---
He enclosed in the packet containing
 the letter the money that had been realized by the sale of the pig,
 with all he had besides,.


---
he heard no more of her except indirectly,, but. 
---
her
 father and his household did not immediately leave
---
his goods and other effects had been sold off
---
When Jude learnt
 and.


---
he packed
 his own household goods into a waggon
---
He then went into lodgings at Alfredston, and.

---
He noted its date, which came and passed without Jude's going near
 the place, or perceiving. 
---
A few
 days later he entered a dingy broker's shop in the main street
 of the town, and
---
he perceived a framed photograph, which turned out to be
 his own portrait.


---
he had had
---
framed by a local man
 in bird's- eye maple, as a present for Arabella
---
was,"_ Jude
 to Arabella_," with the date. 
---
him look at this and the other articles
 in the heap, and
---
the portrait was of himself
---
brought
 home to him by this mute and undesigned evidence of her sale of
 his portrait and gift
---
The utter death of every tender sentiment in his wife, as was the conclusive little stroke required
 to demolish all sentiment in him. 
---
He paid the shilling,.


---
when he
 reached his lodging
---
Two or three days later he heard. 
---
He had sent a message offering to see her for a formal
 leave- taking, but
---
when his day's work was done
---
he came out
 of doors after supper, and. 
---
He could not realize himself. 
---
he seemed. 
---
when he had stood at the
 top of that hill
---
I am a man
---
Yet he said. 
---
He remembered then
---
he was standing not far from the spot at
 which
---
the parting between his father and his mother was said.


---
he
 had taken for that city
---
Jude drew near it, and
. 
---
He remembered.

---
he had proudly cut with
---
It had been done in the first week of his apprenticeship,. 
---
he had been diverted from his purposes by an unsuitable woman
---
He
 wondered. 
---
he could still discern
---
he had cut so enthusiastically so long
 ago:


            
---
Surely his plan should
 be? _
---
even he did see uglinesses in the world
---
he had heard
---
He might battle with his evil star, and.


---
off he uncovered the horizon in a
 north- easterly direction. 
---
It was enough for him. 
---
He would go to Christminster as soon as the
 term of his apprenticeship expired.


---
He returned to his lodgings in a better mood, and.






---
Part" Save his own soul hath no star."--SWINBURNE.


   
---
The next noteworthy move in Jude's life was. 
---
he appeared
 and the disruption of his coarse conjugal life with her
---
He was

---
He had
---
he
 was out of his apprenticeship, and with his tools at his back-- the start
---
barring
 the interruption involved in his intimacy and married experience with
 Arabella he had been looking forward for about ten years.


---
Jude would now have been described as a young man with a forcible,
 meditative, and earnest rather than handsome cast of countenance.

---
He was of dark complexion, with dark harmonizing eyes, and
---
he wore
 a closely trimmed black beard of more advanced growth than is usual
 at his age
---
this was some
 trouble to him in combing and washing out the stone- dust that settled
 on it in the pursuit of his trade. 
---
His capabilities in the latter,
 having been acquired in the country
---
he would probably have become specialized and," a" foliage sculptor"--perhaps a" statuary."


---
He had, and
---
one more
 nearly related to the emotional side of him than to the intellectual,
 is often the case with young men. 
---
he had gone to Marygreen, and. 
---
He had asked. 
---
it haunted him; and
.


---
He now paused at the top of a crooked and gentle declivity,
 and. 
---
Reaching the bottom he moved along the level way between pollard
 willows, and. 
---
which had sent into
 the sky the gleam and glory that caught his strained gaze in his days
 of dreaming
---
They winked their yellow eyes at him
 dubiously, and.


---
they had been awaiting him all these
 years in disappointment at his tarrying
---
though they did not much want him
 now
---
He was a species of Dick Whittington
---
He went along the outlying
 streets with the cautious tread of an explorer. 
---
He saw nothing of
 the real city in the suburbs on this side. 
---
he scrutinized carefully such localities;
 and
---
he demanded
---
he did not know this at the time. 
---
Here he installed himself,
 and.


---
To guide himself he
 opened under a lamp a map he had brought. 
---
he could see enough to decide on the direction he
 should take to reach the heart of the place.


---
he came up to the first ancient mediæval pile
 that he had encountered. 
---
he could see by the
 gateway
---
He entered it,. 
---
then he began. 
---
When he
 passed objects out of harmony with its general expression he allowed
 his eyes to slip over them as if he did not see them.


---
he listened. 
---
He must have made a mistake
---
he thought
---
he could no longer get into the
 quadrangles
---
he rambled under the walls and doorways,. 
---
still he serpentined
 among the shadows, for had he not imagined these scenes through
 ten bygone years, and what mattered a night's rest for once? 
---
apparently
 never trodden now by the foot of man, and
---
Knowing not a human being here Jude began. 
---
the
 sensation being that of one who walked but could not make himself
 seen or heard
---
He drew his breath pensively, and,
---
seeming thus
 almost his own ghost, gave his thoughts to the other ghostly
 presences with which the nooks were haunted.


---
he had read
 and. 
---
learnt by one in his
 position
---
Some of them, by the accidents of his reading loomed out in
 his fancy disproportionately large by comparison with the rest. 
---
he
 ran against them without feeling their bodily frames
---
he
 could not go in. 
---
There were poets abroad, of early date and of late,
 from the friend and eulogist of Shakespeare down to him. 
---
Speculative philosophers drew along, not always
 with wrinkled foreheads and hoary hair as in framed portraits, but
 pink- faced, slim, and active as in youth; modern divines sheeted in
 their surplices, among whom the most real to Jude Fawley were the
 founders of the religious school called Tractarian; the well- known
 three, the enthusiast, the poet, and the formularist, the echoes
 of.

---
whose teachings had influenced him even in his obscure home
---
A start of aversion appeared in his fancy; the smoothly shaven historian
 so ironically civil to Christianity; with others of the same
 incredulous temper, who knew each quad as well as the faithful, and
 took equal freedom in haunting its cloisters.


---
He regarded the statesmen in their various types
---
men of firmer
 movement and less dreamy air grew with his growth in years, and the man whose
 mind contracted with the same.


---
The scientists and philologists followed on in his mind- sight in
 an odd impossible combination
---
men of meditative faces strained
 foreheads, and weak- eyed as bats with constant research
---
,, then he took little interest
---
he knew barely
 the names. 
---
attached to the prelates, by reason of
 his own former hopes
---
he had an ample band-- some men of
 heart
---
Of them others rather men of head he; the saintly author of the Evening Hymn; and near them the
 great itinerant preacher, hymn- writer, and zealot shadowed like Jude
 by his matrimonial difficulties.


---
Jude found. 
---
himself speaking out loud,
---
he suddenly ceased
 with a start at his absurdity
---
Perhaps those incoherent words of the
 wanderer were heard within the walls by some student or thinker over
 his lamp; and
---
he may have raised his head, and. 
---
Jude now perceived.


---
so far as he had the whole aged city to himself with the exception
 of a belated townsman here and there, and
---
he seemed
---
A voice reached him out of the shade
---
It came from a policeman who had been observing Jude without the
 latter observing him.


---
Jude went home and to bed, after reading up a little about these men
 and their several messages to the world from a book or two that he
 had brought with him concerning the sons of the university. 
---
he
 drew towards sleep various memorable words of theirs that he had

---
As just been conning seemed;
 some audible, some unintelligible to him. 
---
who
 afterwards mourned Christminster as" the home of lost causes," though
 Jude did not remember this
---
he had

---
Jude thought, but... 
---
his soul
 might have been shaping the historic words of his master- speech:

"
---
namely there should be free access to the food of man from

---
he had seen just now
---
He likewise heard some phrases spoken by the phantom with the short
 face
---
lastly a gentle- voiced prelate spoke, during whose meek, familiar
 rhyme, endeared to him from earliest childhood
---
And Jude fell asleep:


     
---
He did not wake till morning. 
---
He started up in bed,
---
he
 had overslept himself and
---
His words
 about his schoolmaster had, perhaps, less zest in them than his words
 concerning his cousin.




---
He
 had, and.


---
Passing out into the streets on this errand he found
---
The
 spirits of the great men had disappeared.


---
he read
---
The numberless architectural pages around him, naturally,
 less as an artist- critic of their forms than as an artizan and
 comrade of the dead handicraftsmen actually
 executed those forms. 
---
He examined the mouldings,.


---
he perceived,
---
The condition of several moved him
. 
---
he would have been moved by maimed sentient beings
---
The rottenness of these historical documents reminded him. 
---
he was
 not, after all,
---
practically he
 had intended
---
He had come, and and
---
there must be plenty for one of
 his trade to do in the business of renovation
---
He asked his way to
 the workyard of the stone- mason; and.


---
he had

---
He asked for the foreman, and. 
---
For a moment there fell on Jude a true illumination that here in the
 stone yard was a centre of effort as worthy as that dignified by the
 name of scholarly study within the noblest of the colleges. 
---
he
 lost it under stress of his old idea. 
---
He would accept any employment
 which might be offered him on the strength of his late employer's
 recommendation; but
---
he would accept it as a provisional thing only.

---
This was his form of the modern vice of unrest.


---
Moreover he perceived. 
---
at best only copying, patching and
 imitating went on here; which he fancied to be owing to some
 temporary and local cause
---
He did not see
---
other
 developments were shaping in the world around him,
---
he held in
 reverence
---
he went away
---
he seemed
---
How he wished! 
---
he
 had that pretty portrait of her
---
he wrote to his aunt. 
---
he was not
---
Jude, a ridiculously affectionate fellow, promised
 nothing,
---
put the photograph on the mantel- piece, kissed it he did

---
It was cheering-- the one thing uniting him to
 the emotions of the living city.


---
he could not possibly hunt up such a respectable man just yet
---
But so raw and unpolished was his condition
---
;
 so precarious were his
 fortunes. 
---
Thus he still remained in loneliness. 
---
people
 moved round him
---
Although he virtually saw none. 
---
Not as yet having mingled
 with the active life of the place it was largely non- existent to him.

---
he heard that
 past announcing itself with an emphasis altogether unsuspected by,
 and even incredible to, the habitual residents.


---
he haunted the cloisters and quadrangles of the
 colleges at odd minutes in passing them, surprised by impish
 echoes of his own footsteps, smart as the blows of a mallet. 
---
The
 Christminster" sentiment," as ate further and
 further into him
---
he probably knew more about those buildings
 materially, artistically, and historically, than any one of their
 inmates.


---
when he found himself actually on the spot of
 his enthusiasm
---
Jude perceived how far away from the object of
 that enthusiasm
---
he really was. 
---
Only a wall divided him from those
 happy young contemporaries of his
---
he shared a common mental
 life
---
he went in search of labour
---
as he saw them
. 
---
he was as far from them as if he had been at the
 antipodes. 
---
Of course he was. 
---
He was a young workman in a white
 blouse, and with stone- dust in the creases of his clothes; and
---
they did not even see him, or
---
they were to him
---
Whatever he to them was not on the spot at all; and

---
yet he had fancied by coming there.


---
he would be close to their lives
---
he could only be so
 fortunate
---
if as to get into good employment he would put up with the
 inevitable. 
---
So he thanked God for his health and strength, and. 
---
he was outside the gates of everything
---
,
 perhaps he would be inside. 
---
he might
---
he did receive a message from the stone- mason's yard. 
---
a job was waiting for him
---
It was his first encouragement, and
---
he
 closed with the offer promptly.


---
He was young and strong, or
---
he never could have executed with such
 zest the undertakings to which he now applied himself, since they
 involved reading most of the night after working all the day. 
---
First
 he bought a shaded lamp for four and six- pence, and. 
---
Then he got pens, paper, and. 
---
Then he shifted all the furniture of his room-- a single one
 for living and sleeping--.


---
how he was curtailing the hours of sleep
---
which had disappeared in the wake of his wife
---
Having been deeply encumbered by marrying, getting a cottage, and
 buying the furniture he had never been able to save any money since the time of those
 disastrous ventures, and. 
---
his wages began
---
he was

---
he could not even afford himself a fire; and
---
he sat over his lamp in
 a great- coat, hat, and woollen gloves.


---
he could perceive the spire of the cathedral, and
---
he could also get a glimpse of by going to the staircase
---
he used as stimulants
---
when his faith in the future was
 dim
---
he made no inquiries into details of
 procedure. 
---
Picking up general notions from casual acquaintance he
 never dwelt upon them. 
---
he said to himself,. 
---
His desire absorbed him, and.


---
he received a nervously anxious letter from his poor old
 aunt, on the subject which had previously distressed her-- a fear that
 Jude would not be strong- minded enough to keep away from his cousin
 Sue Bridehead and her relations. 
---
Sue's father, his aunt believed,
 but
---
Jude was rather on an intellectual track than a theological
---
he walked at his earliest spare
 minutes past the shops answering to his great- aunt's description; and
 beheld in one of them a young girl sitting behind a desk, who was
 suspiciously like the original of the portrait. 
---
He ventured and
---
his purchase lingered on the
 scene. 
---
He felt very shy of looking at the girl in the desk
---
he recognized in the accents certain qualities of his
 own voice; softened and sweetened, but his own. 
---
He stole a glance round. 
---
Hereon the single word


    A L L E L U J A


" A sweet, saintly, Christian business, hers! thought he.


---
He came out. 
---
it seemed scarcely honourable towards his aunt. 
---
So Jude gave no sign. 
---
He would not call upon Sue just yet. 
---
He had
 other reasons against doing so. 
---
when he had walked away
---
he felt
---
he was as yet unready to encounter her,
---
he
 had felt about Mr. Phillotson
---
particularly when he had told her
---
Thus he kept watch over her, and.

---
The consciousness of her living presence stimulated him. 
---
afterwards Jude was engaged with some
 more men, outside Crozier College in Old- time Street, in getting a
 block of worked freestone from a waggon across the pavement, before
 hoisting it to the parapet which they were repairing. 
---
Standing in
 position the head man said," Spaik when he heave!
---
He- ho! heaved.


---
he lifted
---
All of a sudden as his cousin stood close to his elbow,
. 
---
His closeness to her was so suggestive that he trembled, and turned
 his face away with a shy instinct to prevent her recognizing him,
 though as she had never once seen him she could not possibly do so;
 and might very well never have heard even his name. 
---
He could
 perceive that.


---
he continued his work,. 
---
He had
 been so caught by her influence. 
---
he had taken no count of her
 general mould and build
---
He remembered now.

---
That was about all he had seen. 
---
the much that surprised him. 
---
How could one of his cross- grained, unfortunate,
 almost accursed stock have contrived? 
---
he supposed.


---
which had been accumulating in his
 breast
---
he dwelt in
---
he perceived.


---
whatever his obedient
 wish in a contrary direction he would soon be unable to resist the
 desire to make himself known to her
---
He affected.


---
he was married, and
---
even were he free,
---
Therefore again he would have
---
Jude's instinct was, and
---
he went to the morning
 service in the Cathedral church of Cardinal College,.


---
he had found
---
he awaited her in the afternoon,
---
He knew, and
---
he stood in a corner. 
---
her he advanced up the side opposite, and. 
---
he had not as yet revealed
 himself
---
He lingered awhile in the vestibule, and
---
when he was put into a seat
---
when a religion of some sort seems a necessity to
 ordinary practical men, and not only a luxury of the emotional
 and leisured classes
---
he could discern the opposite worshippers
 indistinctly only, but
---
he saw. 
---
He had not
 long discovered the exact seat that she occupied when the chanting
 of the119th Psalm in which the choir was engaged reached its second
 part,
---
_ In quo corriget_, as the singers Wherewithal shall cleanse his way?



---
It was the very question that was engaging Jude's attention at this
 moment. 
---
he had been
---
he had done
---
supernatural
 he had been
---
he could hardly believe
---
that
 specially set by some regardful Providence for this
 moment of his first entry into the solemn building
---
he was beginning
---
ensphered by the same harmonies as those
 which floated into his ears
---
the thought was a delight to him.

---
the consciousness of having at last found anchorage for
 his thoughts, to supply both social and spiritual
 possibilities was like the dew of Hermon, and
---
he remained throughout
 the service in a sustaining atmosphere of ecstasy.


---
he was loth to suspect it
---
Though some people might have said to him
.


---
Jude waited. 
---
he himself moved
---
he reached the door
---
he was inclined
---
he was not quite ready; and, alas?


---
he to do so with the kind of feeling that was awakening in him
---
he had persuaded himself.

---
such was the case, he
 could not altogether be blind to the real nature of the magnetism
---
he
 said,"! 
---
It would put all thought of a tender wish on his part out
 of Sue's mind, and.

---
It was with some heartache that he saw.




---
how little he cared for the
 freedom and fearlessness that would result in her from such
 knowledge
---
which he was re arranging before proceeding with them on his way
---
The man rose, and,!" in an accent
 that agreed with his appearance. 
---
he dexterously lifted
 upon his knee the great board with its assembled notabilities divine
 and human, and. 
---
First he offered her his
 smaller wares-- the busts of kings and queens, then a minstrel, then
 a winged Cupid. 
---
He said.


---
the image- man drew them and
. 
---
the man had gone
---
Jude also
 had begun
---
I bought them of a travelling man who sells casts--"


---
It fell upon the ears of another person who sat bending over his
 books at a not very distant spot in the same city. 
---
Being Saturday
 night was one on which Jude had not set his alarm- clock to
 call him at his usually early time, and hence he had stayed up, as
 was his custom, two or three hours later than he could afford to do
 on any other day of the week. 
---
Just then he was earnestly reading
 from his Griesbach's text. 
---
the policeman and belated citizens passing
 along under his window
---
they had stood still,
 strange syllables mumbled with fervour within-- words that had for
 Jude an indescribable enchantment: inexplicable sounds something
 like these:--

"
---
He was a handy man at his trade, an all- round man,. 
---
the man declines. 
---
When there was not much Gothic moulding for
 Jude to run, or much window- tracery on the bankers
---
he would go out
 lettering monuments or tombstones, and.


---
that he saw her
---
when he was on a ladder executing
 a job of this sort inside one of the churches
---
Jude came down from his
 ladder, and. 
---
he could resume his tapping
---
He
 did not observe
---
Jude sat and. 
---
a help would have been to him in
 happier circumstances
---
It was not so much his anxiety to get on with
 his work that made him go up to it
---
he dared not,
---
why he must
 not attempt intimate acquaintance with Sue Bridehead, now that his
 interest in her had shown itself to be unmistakably of a sexual kind,

---
man could
 not live by work alone
---
the particular man Jude wanted something to love. 
---
Some men would have rushed incontinently
 to her,
---
he found himself, to his moral consternation,
. 
---
walking past the
 spots he was always thinking of her, and.


---
his conscience was likely to be the loser in
 this battle
---
he desired
---
though to know her he
 did not desire
---
There was not the least doubt that from his own orthodox point of
 view
---
when the man was bent on such a course
---
This
 conviction was so real with him that one day
---
when as was frequent he was at work in a neighbouring village church alone
---
,,
 he felt. 
---
it to
 be his duty
---
he wished
---
he could not get on
---
he found,. 
---
So
 he excused himself. "
---
he said,
---
Thus he went on,. 
---
those items were not
 at all the cause of his affection for her
---
said one of the men known as Uncle Joe.


---
he's doing now
---
Mr. Jude Fawley was at work in the yard
---
Jude
 had gone out somewhere or other that afternoon, which information she
 received with a look of disappointment, and
---
When Jude returned
---
they told him, and!"


---
whereupon he
 exclaimed,"
---
He looked along the street after her, but
---
He
 had no longer any thought of a conscientious avoidance of her, and
. 
---
when he reached
 his lodging
---
he found a note from her-- a first note-- one of those
 documents which, simple and commonplace in themselves, are seen
 retrospectively to have been pregnant with impassioned consequences.

---
which is shown in such
 innocent first epistles from women to men
---
That was a contingency he had never thought of, and
---
it spurred him
. 
---
He would meet her
---
he said, one hour from the time of writing, at the cross in
 the pavement which marked the spot of the Martyrdoms.


---
When he had despatched the note by a boy he regretted
---
he should have suggested to her. 
---
when
 he might have said
---
he would call upon her
---
the
 country custom to meet thus, and nothing else had occurred to him
---
he moved towards the point a few minutes before
 the hour, under the glimmer of the newly lighted lamps.


---
He saw a figure on the other side, which turned out to
 be hers, and
---
Jude watched
.


---
when he did likewise
---
Jude did not look much at her
---
I have,
 indeed, one very old friend here somewhere, but I do n't quite like
 to call on him just yet. 
---
you know anything of him-- Mr
---
he is
---
I only know of one Mr. Phillotson. 
---
He lives a little way out in
 the country, at Lumsdon. 
---
He's a village schoolmaster."


---
he's the same
---
Do you know his Christian name
---
is it Richard?"


---
" Yes-- I've directed books to him,."


---
I've never seen him
---
Then he could n't do it!"


---
Jude's countenance fell, for how could he succeed in an enterprise
? 
---
wherein the great Phillotson had failed
---
He would have had a day of
 despair.


---
the news had not arrived during his sweet Sue's presence,
 but
---
he had visions of how Phillotson's failure in
 the grand university scheme would depress him when she had gone
---
As to take a walk, suppose call upon him? said Jude suddenly. 
---
Mr. Phillotson was likely to
 be at home
---
he was always at home
---
A knock
 brought him to the school- house door, with a candle in his hand and a
 look of inquiry on his face, which had grown thin and careworn since
 Jude last set eyes on him.


---
the halo surrounded the school- master's figure in Jude's imagination ever
 since their parting. 
---
It created in him at the same time a sympathy
 with Phillotson as an obviously much chastened and disappointed man.

---
Jude told him his name, and.


---
he had come
---
who had been kind to him in his youthful days
---
said Jude,.


---
he had not come
---
Come in said Phillotson. 
---
Phillotson took it off,.


---
The old friendship was imperceptibly renewed, the schoolmaster
 speaking of his experiences, and the cousins of theirs. 
---
He told them

---
he still thought of the Church sometimes, and
---
he
 could not enter it
---
he had intended
---
he might
 enter it as a licentiate. 
---
he said
---
Meanwhile he was comfortable in
 his present position,.


---
he was in want of a pupil- teacher
---
Though Jude was surprised to
 find what a revelation of woman his cousin was to him. 
---
he perceived
---
her sentiments towards him
 were those of the frankest friendliness only
---
he loved her more than
 before becoming acquainted with her; and
---
he said regretfully. 
---
me ask Mr. Phillotson
---
you try your hand in his
 school
---
Jude did not like,
 and.


---
he agreed with her
---
he had his lodging
---
he again set out
 for Lumsdon,
---
" as he said. 
---
Jude said.


---
he thought, and
---
his ingenious
 arguments on her natural fitness for assisting Mr. Phillotson, of
 which knew nothing whatever
---
he said
---
he would engage her,, and
---
his cousin really meant
---
Phillotson received a letter from Jude,
; and. 
---
he had again consulted his cousin
---
It did not occur for a moment to the
 schoolmaster and recluse that Jude's ardour in promoting the
 arrangement arose from any other feelings towards Sue than the
 instinct of co- operation common among members of the same family.




---
The schoolmaster sat in his homely dwelling,
; and
---
he looked across the way at the old
 house in which his teacher Sue had a lodging. 
---
A pupil- teacher to have been
 transferred to Mr. Phillotson's school had failed him, and
---
Phillotson thought
,
---
there would be no difficulty in retaining her services, which he
 already wished to do
---
He had found her quite as bright;
 and?


---
Jude had described her
---
who
 saves him
---
he
 was waiting,. 
---
when he would
 follow
---
he watched her as a curiosity. 
---
He went to the school also, and. 
---
It was part of his duty and
---
Richard Phillotson thought of
 the absurdity of the regulation in this case,; but
---
when he was old enough
 to be the girl's father
---
he faithfully acted up to it; and. 
---
as if being the master he must perceive
 all that was passing in her brain, as right or wrong
---
Phillotson was

---
which somehow seemed strange to him as preceptor
---
he was thinking of her thus
---
their work had gone on with a monotony which in
 itself was a delight to him. 
---
her little thumb cocked up against its stem; and Phillotson
 behind in his long dangling coat,. 
---
which had come over him since her
 arrival
---
the proprietor, with a fine religious philanthropy written on his
 features walked round it with a pointer in his hand,
---
he said,
---
I am sure this man does n't."


---
his form being bent so low in his intent

---
his face was
---
He does n't think!"


---
I did n't see him!
---
Jude how seriously are going into it!"


---
Jude started up from his reverie, and. 
---
he said,
 with a glad flush of embarrassment. 
---
said Phillotson, with good- humoured satire. 
---
"__ said Jude ardently( although he did not).

---
That's a good Jude
---
He watched the
 juvenile flock in their clean frocks and pinafores,. 
---
Phillotson had invited him
---
, Jude had eagerly promised.


---
Phillotson was
 surprised to find upon it, a perspective
 view of Jerusalem, with every building shown in its place.


---
" hardly looked at
 it he said.


---
To Mr. Phillotson he had been played that trick too many times to be unprepared.

---
Phillotson, with a strange instinct of solicitude
 quite beyond his control was at her side just in time. 
---
him holding her hand
---
Now
 he'll write and and
---
He wo n't do that, my dear little girl. 
---
He looked so gently at her. 
---
Jude in the meantime had been waiting impatiently for Friday. 
---
he had been so much under the influence
 of his desire to see her that he walked after dark some distance
 along the road in the direction of the village, and, on returning to
 his room to read
---
he had got himself up
---
he
 thought and
---
On Friday, as soon as as to see him made a hasty tea he set
 out, notwithstanding. 
---
they dripped sadly upon him,
-- illogical forebodings
---
he
 knew
---
he loved her
---
overhead
 impressing him with forebodings though that he also knew.


---
he could not be more to her
 than he was
---
that
 greeted his eyes
---
He was too far back, but
---
them to notice
 him
---
he knew in a moment. 
---
as deserted
 lane Jude saw Phillotson place his arm round the girl's waist;
; but and. 
---
he replaced it;
---
There he remained
.


---
Phillotson going on to the school hard by
---
he's too old for her-- too old!"
---
He could not interfere. 
---
Was he not Arabella's? 
---
He was unable to
 go on further, and. 
---
Every
 tread of his feet seemed. 
---
he must stand in the schoolmaster's way with Sue
---
Phillotson was perhaps
 twenty years her senior, but
---
The ironical clinch to his sorrow was

---
the intimacy between his cousin and the
 schoolmaster had been brought about entirely by himself
---
he went a visit which was the result of
 a victorious struggle against his inclination to turn aside to the
 village of Lumsdon and obtain a miserable interview with his cousin,
 and.


---
which had tortured him
---
a great part of Jude's
 short day was occupied in making arrangements for her comfort. 
---
him to leave
---
he obtained a quiet talk with her, and
---
his
 words tended insensibly towards his cousin
---
Your marrying was about as bad a thing as a man
. 
---
A relief was afforded to him by the entry of the companion and nurse
 of his aunt,
---
when a pupil at the village school across the green
 opposite, before her father went to London
---
All boys except
 herself; and then'd say,'. 
---
These retrospective visions of Sue only made Jude the more miserable
 that he was unable to woo her, and he left the cottage of his aunt
 that day with a heavy heart. 
---
He would fain have glanced into the
 school but
---
he checked his desire and.


---
who had known him during his
 residence here
---
Jude
 was startled by a salute from one of them:


---
Jude showed.


---
he did not understand
---
" Yes; more! cried Jude.


---
said Jude. 
---
How so Jude slapped his pocket.


---
said Jude, with some bitterness. 
---
Still the remark was sufficient to withdraw Jude's attention from
 the imaginative world he had lately inhabited,. 
---
an abstract
 figure, more or less himself was steeping his mind in a sublimation
 of the arts and sciences, and
---
He was set. 
---
He had lately felt. 
---
he
 could not quite satisfy himself in his Greek-- in the Greek of
 the dramatists particularly
---
So fatigued was he sometimes after
 his day's work. 
---
he could not maintain the critical attention
 necessary for thorough application
---
He felt.


---
he wanted a
 coach-- a friend at his elbow to tell him in a moment what sometimes
 would occupy him a weary month in extracting from unanticipative,
 clumsy books
---
he had done
---
was the good, after all, of using
 up his spare hours in a vague labour called" private study" without
 giving an outlook on practicabilities?


---
" to have thought of this before he said,. 
---
he journeyed
 back
---
accordingly he sought it. 
---
when he saw an elderly gentleman
---
Jude chanced
---
Jude
 looked anxiously at his face. 
---
Jude felt; but
---
he could not
 go up and
---
he was sufficiently influenced by the
 incident.


---
him to state his
 difficulties by letter to some of the best and most judicious of
 these old masters, and
---
he accordingly placed himself in such
 positions about the city
---
he ultimately selected five
---
he addressed letters,.


---
Jude mentally began to criticize
 them he wished. 
---
he thought. 
---
Nevertheless he found. 
---
himself clinging to the hope of some reply
 as to his one last chance of redemption
---
He waited day after day,
.

---
he waited
---
While he was suddenly stirred by news about Phillotson.

---
Phillotson was giving up the school near Christminster, for a larger
 one further south, in Mid- Wessex. 
---
What how it would
 affect his cousin;
---
; whether,, he would not allow.

---
himself to say
---
Jude was passionately enamoured
---
Jude had written
 vouchsafed no answer, and
---
Meanwhile the academic dignitaries to whom was thus thrown back
 entirely on himself, as formerly, with the added gloom of a weakened
 hope. 
---
he soon perceived
---
clearly he had

---
long uneasily suspected that to qualify himself for certain open
 scholarships and exhibitions
---
It was next to impossible that a man reading on his own
 system, however widely and thoroughly, even over the prolonged period
 of ten years, should be able to compete with those who had passed
 their lives under trained teachers and.


---
The other course so to speak seemed the
 only one really open to men like him, the difficulty being simply of
 a material kind. 
---
he began, and
---
he would be
 able to save money
---
With the help of his information to reckon
 the extent of this material obstacle ascertained, to his dismay,
 that, at the rate at which, with the best of fortune, fifteen years must elapse. 
---
he could be in a
 position to forward testimonials to the head of a college and advance
 to a matriculation examination
---
He saw. 
---
what a curious and cunning glamour the neighbourhood of the
 place had exercised over him
---
the spot shaped its
 charms to him from its halo on the horizon, the obvious and ideal
 thing to do
---
" Let he had said with the
 fatuousness of Crusoe over his big boat," and
---
It would have been far better for him in
 every way,. 
---
he had never come within sight and sound of the delusive
 precincts
---
that was clear to him
---
He looked back at himself along the
 vista of his past years, and
---
his thought was akin to Heine's:


   
---
Fortunately he had not been allowed. 
---
the
 painful details of his awakening to a sense of his limitations should
 now be spared her as far as possible. 
---
He always remembered the appearance of the afternoon on which he
 awoke from his dream. 
---
Not quite knowing what to do with himself he
 went up to an octagonal chamber in the lantern of a singularly built
 theatre that was set amidst this quaint and singular city. 
---
Jude's eyes swept all the views in
 succession, meditatively, mournfully, yet sturdily. 
---
Those buildings
 and their associations and privileges were not for him. 
---
he hardly ever had time
 to enter
---
his gaze travelled on to the varied spires, halls, gables,
 streets, chapels, gardens, quadrangles,. 
---
He saw.


---
his destiny lay not with
 these, but among the manual toilers in the shabby purlieu which he
 himself occupied, unrecognized as part of the city at all by its
 visitors and panegyrists, yet without whose denizens the hard readers
 could not read nor the high thinkers live
---
He looked over the town into the country beyond, to the trees which
 screened her whose presence. 
---
he might have borne with his fate. 
---
he could
 have renounced his ambitions with a smile. 
---
he had

---
himself should affect him disastrously
---
Phillotson had
 no doubt passed through a similar intellectual disappointment to
 that. 
---
which now enveloped him
---
Descending to the streets he went listlessly along, and. 
---
he arrived
 at an inn
---
Here he drank several glasses of beer in
 rapid succession, and
---
when he came out
---
he rambled home to supper, and. 
---
when his landlady brought up a letter that had just
 arrived for him
---
Jude perceived
---
he had

---
ONE-- at last!" cried Jude.


---
not exactly he had expected
---
He had known all
 that before. 
---
He knew. 
---
its effect upon him just now was, and,. 
---
him
 rise recklessly from the table
---
He stood at a bar and
---
he
 came to a spot called The Fourways in the middle of the city,
---
he began.


---
You've had a wet, young man
---
No; he replied cynically.


---
Whatever his wetness his brains were dry enough. 
---
He only heard in
 part the policeman's further remarks,. 
---
Fourways men had stood
 and. 
---
He began.

---
These struggling men and women before him were the reality of
 Christminster,.

---
He looked at his watch, and, in pursuit of this idea
---
he went on.

---
he came to a public hall, where a promenade concert was in progress
---
Jude entered, and. 
---
He had tapped the
 real Christminster life. 
---
a man got upon
 a platform and.


---
he came away,
---
he took from his pocket the
 lump of chalk which as a workman he usually carried there, and
---
The stroke of scorn relieved his mind, and
---
he
 laughed at his self- conceit.
---
He re read the letter from the master, and.

---
the wisdom in its lines,
 exasperated him,
---
He saw himself as a fool indeed.


---
Deprived of the objects of both intellect and emotion he could not
 proceed to his work. 
---
Whenever he felt
---
reconciled to his fate as a
 student there came. 
---
he had ever met
---
the one affined soul was lost to him
 through his marriage. 
---
unable to bear it longer he again rushed for distraction to the
 real Christminster life
---
He now sought it out in an obscure and
 low- ceiled tavern up a court which was well known to certain worthies
 of the place, and in brighter times would have interested him simply
 by its quaintness. 
---
Here he sat more or less all the day, convinced
 that he was at bottom a vicious character, of whom it was hopeless to
 expect anything.


---
Jude still retaining his seat in the corner,
---
his money was
---
he had not eaten anything the whole day except a biscuit
---
He surveyed his gathering companions with all the equanimity
 and philosophy of a man who has been drinking long and slowly,
 and
---
made friends with several: to wit, Tinker Taylor, a decayed
 church- ironmonger to have been of a religious turn in
 earlier years, but was somewhat blasphemous now; also a red- nosed
 auctioneer also two Gothic masons like himself, called Uncle Jim and
 Uncle Joe. 
---
Jude Fawley, with the self- conceit, effrontery, and_ aplomb_ of
 a strong- brained fellow in liquor threw in his remarks somewhat
 peremptorily; and
---
his aims having been
---
what everything turned upon his tongue, by a sort
 of mechanical craze, to the subject of scholarship and study,.


---
the
 extent of his own learning being dwelt upon with an insistence that
 would have appeared pitiable to himself in his sane hours
---
he was saying,"
---
I should n't have been the man I am."


---
He drank off the spirits in his tumbler,."


---
" said Jude.


---
he can
---
said Jude. 
---
the
 glass was handed across to Jude,.
---
Jude had declaimed steadily ahead, and. 
---
Jude's mind seemed, and
---
he could not get
 on. 
---
He put his hand to his forehead, and
---
his face assumed an
 expression of pain.


---
" Give him another glass then he'll fetch up and
---
, Jude stretched
 out his arm for it without looking, and"_ Et in Spiritum Sanctum, Dominum et vivificantem, qui ex Patre
 Filioque procedit. 
---
he neared the
 end with the manner of a priest
---
Then Jude seemed,.


---
he stared
 round upon them
---
he cried. 
---
who had already had his license
---
Jude had turned in disgust and.


---
He hastened down the lane and round into the straight broad street,
 and
---
he followed,
---
all sound of his
 late companions had been left behind. 
---
Onward he still went, under
 the influence of a childlike yearning for the one being in the world

---
whose ill
 judgement was not apparent to him now. 
---
he entered the village of
 Lumsdon, and
---
he assumed
---
Jude stepped close to the wall, and!"


---
he sinking down upon
 the doorstep
---
the other
 supporting him
---
he wanted anything to eat
---
he shook his head.

---
Almost immediately he fell into a heavy slumber, and. 
---
he did not know, but, and
---
where he was
---
he beheld it in all the ghastliness
 of a right mind. 
---
How
 could he face her now? 
---
there would be in all his shame
. 
---
He could not bear the thought, and
---
softly drawing
 on his boots, and taking his hat from the nail on which he slipped noiselessly out of the house.


---
His fixed idea was; and
---
which occurred to him
---
He called at his lodging in Christminster, and. 
---
where he found;
---
having packed up he
 turned his back upon the city that had been such a thorn in his
 side, and struck southward into Wessex
---
He had no money left in
 his pocket,. 
---
his small savings, deposited at one of the banks in
 Christminster,
---
To get to
 Marygreen therefore his only course was walking; and
---
,, he had ample time to complete on the way
 the sobering process begun in him.


---
he reached Alfredston. 
---
Here he pawned
 his waistcoat, and
---
he rose,.


---
which had been visible to him a long
 way off
---
whereon he had carved
 his hopes years ago
---
He reached the ancient hamlet.

---
Weary and mud- bespattered, but quite possessed of his ordinary
 clearness of brain he sat down by the well,. 
---
he did
---
so
 he made
---
he bathed
 his face, and
---
he found

---
What-- out o' work?" asked his relative,, under lids heavy as pot- covers, no other cause for his
 tumbled appearance.

" Yes
---
" regarding him through eyes
 sunken deep suggesting itself to one said Jude heavily. 
---
he went up to his old room and. 
---
He fell
 asleep for a short while, and
---
when he awoke
---
he had

---
He thought of that previous abyss
---
he had fallen before leaving this part of the country
---
into
 which the
 deepest deep he had supposed it then; but
---
That had been the breaking in of the outer bulwarks of his hope:
.


---
this was of his second line
---
he had been a woman he must have screamed under the nervous
 tension which he was now undergoing. 
---
that relief being denied to
 his virility
---
he clenched his teeth in misery,.


---
He guessed its origin in a moment or two
---
the curate was praying with
 his aunt in the adjoining room. 
---
He remembered.

---
Jude sat up, and!"


---
The step made for his door, and
---
a man looked in.

---
" said Jude. 
---
Slowly Jude unfolded to the curate his late plans and movements, by
 an unconscious bias,.


---
who was a new man to this neighbourhood
---
at last he said:". 
---
you do not is that of a thoughtful and educated man
---
A man could preach and
.

---
He feared.

---
his whole scheme had degenerated to,
---
There were thousands of young men on the same self- seeking track
 at the present moment. 
---
that he could not
 might have a touch of goodness and greatness in
 it
---
to enter the Church in such an unscholarly way in any probability rise to a higher grade through all his career than
 that of the humble curate wearing his life out in an obscure village
 or city slum-- that that might be true religion, and a purgatorial course worthy of
 being followed by a remorseful man.


---
this new thought showed itself by
 contrast with his foregone intentions
---
The favourable light in which cheered Jude,; and
---
he sat there,
 shabby and lonely
---
it may be said, the_ coup de grâce_ to his intellectual career-- a career
 which had extended over the greater part of a dozen years. 
---
He did
 nothing, however,,.


---
to be regarded as a social failure, a returned purchase, by the
 half- dozen or so of farmers and other country- people who condescended
 to nod to him
---
Melchester
 was a quiet and soothing place, almost entirely ecclesiastical in its
 tone; a spot where worldly learning and intellectual smartness had no
 establishment; where the altruistic feeling that he did possess would
 perhaps be more highly estimated than a brilliancy which he did not.


---
he should continue for a time to work
 at his trade
---
he had neglected at
 Christminster for the ordinary classical grind
---
better course
 for him than to get employment at the further city, and pursue this
 plan of reading? 
---
his excessive human interest in the new place
 was entirely of Sue's making,
---
he was not blind
---
much
 he conceded to human frailty, and.


---
He considered.

---
he might so mark out his coming years
---
which much attracted him as
 being that of his exemplar
---
when he first began
---
This would allow him plenty of time for deliberate study, and.




---
The time was just the worst in the year for Jude to
 get into new employment, and
---
he had written. 
---
he should postpone his arrival for a month or so,
---
could he come
 immediately?--though
---
when he did come
---
It was Mr. Phillotson who had
 advised her to come there, and
---
Phillotson's suit was not exactly prospering, evidently; and
---
Jude
 felt unreasonably glad. 
---
He packed up his things and.


---
he had known for months
---
the turning over a new leaf he duly looked about for
 a temperance hotel, and. 
---
When he had

---
he walked out into the dull winter light over
 the town bridge
---
standing under the walls of the most graceful
 architectural pile in England he paused and. 
---
turning to the west front
 he walked round. 
---
He took it as a good omen. 
---
It seemed
 to him, full of the superstitions of his beliefs,.


---
he might
 find plenty to do in the art he practised while waiting for a call to
 higher labours
---
Then a wave of warmth came over him
---
he thought
---
he now
 stood to the bright- eyed vivacious girl with the broad forehead
 and pile of dark hair above it
---
he had

---
He went down the broad gravel path towards the building. 
---
Jude opened the
 gate and
---
he was gingerly admitted to a waiting- room, and.


---
he had

---
neither was she quite the
 woman who had written the letter that summoned him. 
---
that were possibly of his recent self- disgrace
---
Jude was quite overcome with emotion.


---
Jude felt. 
---
he was burning, under other
 colours than those of cousinship
---
He could not perceive the least
 sign;
 and
---
even he had the right to behave as one
---
this helped on his growing resolve.


---
he had put off
---
Jude said. 
---
he would like
, and
---
Jude thereupon took her to an inn and. 
---
he listened;
 but
---
it was not-- her relations with
 Phillotson. 
---
he wanted
---
eaten Jude impulsively placed his hand upon hers
---
he works in
---
Mr. Phillotson will use his influence
---
" said Jude,"."


---
he cared about you rather warmly, and
---
He has said something about it."


---
he had
---
Oh, come, Sue he's not so very old. 
---
I saw him
 doing--"


---
putting his arm round your waist."


---
he was going to
---
" Very well, then, dear he said soothingly. 
---
I will marry him
---
his
 plan being
---
what that have got my certificate that he the boys' and often
 do, and."


---
He glanced at her and
---
their eyes met, the reproach in his own belying
 his words. 
---
Then he drew his hand quite away from hers, and. 
---
This was just the one thing he would not be able to bear,
---
it brought him round at once. 
---
he let the subject drift
 away. "
---
he asked,.

"
---
Jude looked distressed.

"
---
He took her to the gate and
---
Jude had a conviction that
 his unhappy visit to her on that sad night had precipitated this
 marriage engagement, and
---
However he set about seeking employment,. 
---
he edged himself in by degrees. 
---
His first work was
 some carving at the cemetery on the hill; and
---
ultimately he became
. 
---
he most desired
---
he had confidence enough in his own
 skill with the mallet and chisel to feel that it would be a matter of
 choice with himself how long he would stay.


---
he took near the Close Gate
---
The lodgings would not have disgraced a
 curate, the rent representing a higher percentage on his wages than
 mechanics of any sort usually care to pay. 
---
His combined bed and
 sitting- room was furnished with framed photographs of the rectories
 and deaneries at which his landlady had lived as trusted servant in
 her time, and the parlour downstairs bore a clock on the mantelpiece
 inscribed to the effect that it was presented to the same
 serious- minded woman by her fellow- servants on the occasion of her
 marriage. 
---
Jude added to the furniture of his room by unpacking
 photographs of the ecclesiastical carvings and monuments that he
 had executed with his own hands; and
---
he was deemed a satisfactory
 acquisition as tenant of the vacant apartment.


---
He found an ample supply of theological books in the city book- shops,
 and. 
---
these his studies were recommenced in a different spirit and
 direction from his former course
---
he read Newman, Pusey, and
 many other modern lights. 
---
He hired a harmonium,.




---
Every detail of the outing was
 a facet reflecting a sparkle to Jude, and
---
he did not venture. 
---
he was leading
---
His Sue's
 conduct was one lovely conundrum to him
---
he could say no more.


---
which comforted Jude in the thought
---
only himself knew the charms those habiliments subdued
---
Jude did not respond. 
---
He thought the remark unnecessarily cruel,
 and partly untrue.


---
Jude stopping by preference in front of the
 devotional pictures by Del Sarto, Guido Reni, Spagnoletto,
 Sassoferrato, Carlo Dolci, and others
---
Jude
 proposed. 
---
Jude cutting from a little covert a long walking- stick for Sue
 as tall as herself, with a great crook, which made her look like a
 shepherdess
---
Jude began.

---
He told them and.


---
said Jude.


---
Do n't' ee mind I he
 said with a deprecating wave of the hand;". 
---
He turned to Jude and?"


---
said Jude.


---
";: said Jude, a recollection of her engagement reviving
 his soreness a little.


---
he had said
---
He took it gladly, and
---
when he opened the gate
---
said a second- year's student, who
 knew about young men. 
---
Miss Traceley saw her at the station with
 him. 
---
he was her cousin
---
who had seen Jude from the window
---
being
 kissed by such a kindly- faced young man
---
two men in their filigree and velvet frames standing together
 beside her looking- glass
---
are these men--
---
who is he?"


---
He is a friend, or. 
---
He was a young man with a black beard."


---
the young
 man Bridehead stayed out, for the very
 good reason that she has no such relative
---
This young man was discharged from his work at Christminster for
 drunkenness and blasphemy in public- houses, and
---
he has come here,."


---
he said, but.


---
he remembered
---
he had taken no notice,

---
Jude sat in his lodgings by the Close Gate.

---
Often he would enter the silent Close, and
. 
---
he had
 nothing else to do but to sit reading and learning all day what many
 of the thoughtless inmates despised
---
having finished
 tea and brushed himself up he was deep in the perusal of the
 Twenty- ninth Volume of Pusey's Library of the Fathers, a set of books
 which he had purchased of a second- hand dealer at a price that seemed
 to him to be one of miraculous cheapness for that invaluable work.
---
He
 fancied
---
he heard
---
something rattle lightly against his window
---
then he
 heard it again. 
---
He rose and
.


---
Jude waited,
---
He palpitated at the thought.
---
he had fled to her in his
---
He unlatched the door of his room,. 
---
He went up, and.


---
Whatever he asked, with alarm.

"
---
before he said. 
---
everything
 was close and handy in Jude's single chamber,. 
---
He opened a drawer,"


---
Jude left the room and. 
---
where he walked up and
 down
---
he returned. 
---
Sitting in
 his only arm- chair he saw on a Sunday, so pathetic in her defencelessness. 
---
his
 heart felt big with the sense of it
---
he sat down beside her,
 but only for a moment
---
do Jude, and I'll get a
 lodging by and by. 
---
Jude put on her his great- coat in addition, and. 
---
he returned with a little bottle in his
 hand
---
he said. 
---
Jude fetched the glass from the
 dressing- table, and. 
---
Jude,
 dying of anxiety lest was glad to hear the regular breathing. 
---
He
 softly went nearer to her, and. 
---
Then he stood with his back to the fire regarding her,
 and.

IV


 Jude's reverie was interrupted by the creak of footsteps ascending
 the stairs.


---
He whisked Sue's clothing from the chair where it was drying, thrust
 it under the bed, and. 
---
I did n't know, Mr. Fawley. 
---
It was Jude's custom to go downstairs to the kitchen, and. 
---
His landlady brought up the
 supper, however, on this occasion, and
---
he took it from her at the
 door.


---
he set the teapot on the hob, and; but
---
he found,
---
So he hung them up again, and
.


---
Jude, began
---
her conversation fixed his attention.


---
" he said with a sigh. 
---
I have no
 fear of men, as such, nor of their books.
---
as to feel-- to be on
 their guard against attacks on their virtue no
 man short of a sensual savage will molest a woman by day or night,
 at home or abroad,. 
---
Until Come on he is always afraid to, and
---
if look
 it he never comes. 
---
he taught me a great deal, and
---
He died, poor fellow, two or three years after he had taken
 his degree and left Christminster."


---
You saw a good deal of him
---
We used and things of that sort-- like two men almost. 
---
He asked me, and
---
when I joined him in London

---
he meant a different thing from what I meant
---
He wanted, but
---
me
 to be his mistress, in fact
---
I was n't in love with him-- and. 
---
he did n't agree to MY plan
---
he did
 so
---
he became a
 leader- writer for one of the great London dailies; till he was taken
 ill, and had to go abroad. 
---
He said. 
---
I was breaking his heart by
 holding out against him so long at such close quarters
---
he could
 never have believed it of woman
---
he said. 
---
He came home merely. 
---
His death caused a
 terrible remorse in me for my cruelty--. 
---
he died of
 consumption and not of me entirely
---
I went down to Sandbourne
 to his funeral, and. 
---
He left me a little
 money--
---
I broke his heart
---
how men
 are-- so much better than women
---
I invested his money, poor fellow, in a bubble scheme, and
. 
---
Jude looked round upon the arm- chair and its occupant,. 
---
he had given shelter to
---
His voice
 trembled
---
he said:"
---
Have you told Mr. Phillotson about this university scholar friend?"


---
did he say?"


---
He did not pass any criticism--
---
I was everything to him,
; and things like that
---
Jude felt much depressed
---
He felt,. 
---
he could not quite say in what way
---
although he said,. 
---
He was the most irreligious
 man I ever knew, and the most moral. 
---
He spoke gently, and
.


---
You are; a man with a passion for learning, but no money, or
 opportunities, or friends. 
---
one
 of the very men was intended for when the colleges
 were founded
---
He noticed. 
---
whenever he tried
---
Jude was extremely, morbidly, curious about her life as
 Phillotson's_ protégée_ and betrothed; yet
---
Well, just what he said. 
---
His heart bumped, and
---
he made no reply.


---
he was using lay near her
---
Jude said brightly,
---
when he had finished and
---
My university friend Mr.--but never mind his name,
 poor boy--. 
---
" H'm!" said Jude, with a sense of sacrilege.


---
Jude looked pained. 
---
he murmured.


---
Her speech
 had grown spirited, and almost petulant at his rebuke, and her eyes
 moist. 
---
But my dear Sue, my very dear Sue, he said,
.


---
he
 might not see her brimming eyes
---
Jude saw the absurdity of
 quarrelling on such a hypothetical subject, and she the silliness of
 crying about what was written in an old book like the Bible.


---
he was. 
---
that man might be you. 
---
He thought of Arabella.


---
" said Jude.


---
He looked away,. 
---
he to be the next one
---
he could only get over the sense of her sex
---
he could
 scarcely believe.


---
time, creed, or absence would ever divide him
 from her
---
his grief at her incredulities returned. 
---
he nodded in his chair likewise. 
---
Whenever
 he aroused himself
---
he turned her things, and.

---
he awoke completely, and,. 
---
Placing the garments by and he went downstairs, and.




---
When he returned
---
Mr. Phillotson will say! 
---
It was quite by
 his wish. 
---
He is the only man in the world for whom
 I have any respect or fear. 
---
he'll forgive me
---
he'll scold
 me!"


---
I'll go to him and explain--".

"
---
I do n't care for him! 
---
He may think--!"


---
he
 likes
---
if I shall do for all him! 
---
he persuaded her.


---
him make her a cup of
 coffee, in a portable apparatus he kept in his room for use on rising
 to go to his work every day before the household was astir
---
Now he said;" and. 
---
Jude accompanying her to the
 station
---
As a head was thrust out
 of an upper window of his lodging and. 
---
him know
---
he wanted
---
to tell you something-- two things he said hurriedly. 
---
Jude's face became so full of complicated glooms that hers was
 agitated in sympathy as she bade him adieu through the carriage
 window. 
---
Melchester was a dismal place enough for Jude that Sunday of her
 departure, and the Close so hateful that he did not go once to the
 cathedral services. 
---
his answer was
---
how he
 thought
---
he would have done
---
He felt.


---
he might have been pretty sure of his own victory
---
it had come to a conflict between Phillotson and himself for the
 possession of her
---
Yet Jude was in danger of attaching more meaning to Sue's impulsive
 note than it really was intended to bear.


---
he found. 
---
himself hoping
---
he received no further communication; and
---
he sent another note,.


---
he
 should pay her a visit some Sunday, the distance
---
He expected a reply on the second morning after despatching his
 missive; but
---
he sent off three brief lines stating that he was coming
 the following day, for he felt sure something had happened.


---
His first and natural thought had been; but
---
it soon occurred to him. 
---
Conjectures were put an end to by
 his arrival at the village school- house near Shaston on the bright
 morning of Sunday, between eleven and twelve o'clock,
---
Jude entered and. 
---
a voice told him
 which way to turn-- the voice of Sue calling his name. 
---
He passed the
 doorway, and.


---
he cried,.

---
he said simply;". 
---
that
 fitted the mood and the moment, under the suasion of which Sue's
 undemonstrative regard of him
---
Some men would have cast scruples to the winds,
 and. 
---
Jude did not. 
---
He had. 
---
It was upon his lips; yet
---
he could not disclose it. 
---
He preferred.


---
he sorrowed
---
he has been?
---
I
 did n't ask him
---
he has been
---
he did n't come any more
---
It was very perplexing to her lover that she should be piqued at his
 honest acquiescence in his rival, if Jude's feelings of love were
 deprecated by her. 
---
He went on to something else.

"
---
he said. 
---
I'll ask Mr. Phillotson
---
Jude left in the afternoon, hopelessly
 unhappy. 
---
he had seen her, and. 
---
he should learn
---
when he awoke
---
he felt rather vexed with her,
 and.

---
he had begun
---
he had gone from her:


   
---
Jude forgave her straightway, and
---
Meanwhile a middle- aged man was dreaming a dream of great beauty
 concerning the writer of the above letter. 
---
He was Richard
 Phillotson, who had recently removed from the mixed village school at
 Lumsdon near Christminster,.


---
Essentially he
 was now bent on making and saving money for a practical purpose--
---
who if might conduct one of the girls'
 schools adjoining his own
---
an unpractical man, that
 of keeping a wife,,, he had advised her,.


---
Jude was removing from Marygreen to Melchester,
 and
---
, he had begun
---
, to sit in his parlour during the dark winter
 nights and re- attempt some of his old studies one branch of
 which had included Roman- Britannic antiquities-- an unremunerative
 labour for a national school- master but a subject.


---
A resumption of this investigation was the outward and apparent hobby
 of Phillotson at present-- his ostensible reason for going alone into
 fields where causeways, dykes, and tumuli abounded, or shutting
 himself up in his house with a few urns, tiles, and mosaics he had
 collected, instead of calling round upon his new neighbours, who for
 their part had showed themselves willing enough to be friendly with
 him. 
---
he was
---
The interior of the room-- the books bespoke the same dignified tale of
 undistracted research-- more than creditable to a man who had had no
 advantages beyond those of his own making. 
---
he was regarding
---
They were historic notes, written in a bold womanly
 hand at his dictation some months before, and
---
it was the clerical
 rendering of word after word that absorbed him.


---
He presently took from a drawer a carefully tied bundle of letters,
. 
---
He unfolded them one by
 one and.
---
it was honourable and generous of
 him
---
he would not come
---
her engagement to him should not be known,
---
he visited her often
---
the man had not
 been often
---
The problem occupied him,.


---
He opened another drawer, and. 
---
he drew a photograph of Sue as a child,
---
long he had known her,

---
It was
 a duplicate of the one she had given Jude, and
---
Phillotson brought it half- way to his lips, but.


---
His speech was a little slow,
 but
---
his tones were sincere enough to make his hesitation no defect.

---
His greying hair was curly, and. 
---
There were four lines across his forehead, and
---
he only
 wore spectacles. 
---
It was almost certainly a
 renunciation forced upon him by his academic purpose, rather than a
 distaste for women, which had hitherto kept him from closing with one
 of the sex in matrimony.


---
when he was not under the eye of the boys
---
whose quick
 and penetrating regard would frequently become almost intolerable to
 the self- conscious master in his present anxious care for Sue,, in the grey hours of morning,.


---
the dream within him was
---
He had honourably acquiesced in Sue's announced wish but
---
he was
 not often;
---
his
 patience being sorely tried
---
he set out one Saturday afternoon. 
---
There the news of her departure-- expulsion
 as was flashed upon him without
 warning or mitigation.


---
he stood at the door expecting in a few
 minutes to behold her face; and
---
when he turned away
---
he could hardly
 see the road before him
---
A short reflection told him.


---
They had informed him at the school where she was living, and
---
having
 no immediate anxiety about her comfort his thoughts took the
 direction of a burning indignation against the training school
 committee. 
---
Phillotson entered the adjacent
 cathedral, just now in a direly dismantled state by reason of
 the repairs. 
---
He sat down on a block of freestone, regardless of
 the dusty imprint it made on his breeches; and
---
his listless eyes
 following the movements of the workmen presently became aware
.


---
Jude had never spoken to his former hero since the meeting by the
 model of Jerusalem. 
---
Having inadvertently witnessed Phillotson's
 tentative courtship of Sue in the lane there had grown up in the
 younger man's mind a curious dislike to think of the elder, to meet
 him, to communicate in any way with him; and since Phillotson's
 success in obtaining at least her promise had become known to Jude he had frankly recognized
---
he did not wish,
---
what excellencies might appertain to his character. 
---
Jude was expecting
---
when therefore he saw the schoolmaster in the nave
 of the building,
---
he was coming
---
which prevented his observing
---
Jude joined him, and
---
they both withdrew from the other workmen to the
 spot where Phillotson had been sitting. 
---
Jude offered him a piece of
 sackcloth for a cushion, and.


---
he reseated himself
---
he were trying
---
where he
 was
---
Jude hurriedly said. 
---
Well"--Jude for a moment felt an unprincipled and fiendish wish to
 annihilate his rival at all cost. 
---
which love for the same woman renders possible to men the most
 honourable in every other relation of life
---
By the exercise of that treachery
 he could send off
 Phillotson in agony and defeat by saying that the scandal was true,
 and. 
---
his
 action did not respond for a moment to his animal instinct; and
---
he said
---
Phillotson trembled, and
---
his naturally pale face acquired a
 corpselike sharpness in its lines. 
---
he had really meant
---
Jude explained readily;.


---
said Phillotson at the conclusion,"?"


---
said Jude solemnly. 
---
when Jude had taken him
 round, and
---
shown him some features of the renovation which Phillotson bade the young man good- day and
.


---
When Jude went to his dinner at one he saw his beloved
 ahead of him in the street leading up from the North Gate, walking
 as if no way looking for him. 
---
Speedily overtaking her he remarked
, and.


---
he had asked her
---
he felt inclined to
 give her the information
---
You have not seen Mr. Phillotson to- day?
---
he ventured.


---
He stopped,.


---
he thought,
---
he must speak as
 an honest man
---
he did not speak, and
---
he seemed to
 imply was nullified by his intention, and
---
he rested rigid
---
he
 began:
---
Jude looked up. 
---
He saw.


---
" he went on with a gloomy
 tongue. 
---
He would have preferred a more congenial
 spot, but,
---
He
 began and. 
---
He tried, but
---
her eyes regarded him
 in estranged silence.


---
he continued. 
---
how wretched he was! 
---
Do n't cry, dear he implored.


---
he could
 not help. 
---
His momentary desire
 was the means of her rallying. 
---
his heart would have ached but.


---
Their views of the relations of man and woman are,

---
He could speak more freely now. 
---
My father used!"


---
yet Jude's last look into her
 eyes was tinged with inquiry,.




---
he felt
---
he did not even now
 quite know her mind
---
VII


 Tidings from Sue after passed across Jude like a
 withering blast.


---
he was led.
---
its contents
 were of a somewhat serious kind by catching sight of the
 signature-- which was in her full name, never used in her
 correspondence with him since her first note:


   
---
Mr. Phillotson and I are. 
---
he generously says. 
---
he does
   
---
It is so good of him,.

   
---
Jude staggered under the news
---
his mouth was so dry
---
Then presently he went
 back to his work and. 
---
he asked himself, and.


---
he worked
---
his announcement of his own marriage had
 pricked her on to this,
---
just his visit to her when in liquor may
 have pricked her on to her engagement
---
he was compelled. 
---
a pique at having his sprung upon her
---
He determined; but
---
he could not write. 
---
Meanwhile there came another note from his impatient
 little dear:


    Jude
---
even my father were friendly
    enough to be willing
---
being the only married relation
    if which he is n't
---
my bridegroom chooses me of his
    own will and pleasure; but
---
I do n't choose him. 
---
Somebody
    GIVES me to him, like a she- ass or she- goat, or any other
    domestic animal. 
---
Jude screwed himself up to heroic key; and! 
---
Surely you care a bit about me
    still!--Ever your affectionate,

    JUDE.



---
What had jarred on him even more than the signature was a little
 sting he had been silent on-- the phrase" married relation"--What an
 idiot
---
him seem as her lover
---
If he could hardly forgive her
---
His offer of his lodging must have commended itself to Phillotson
 at any rate, for the schoolmaster. 
---
Jude immediately
 moved into more commodious quarters, as much.


---
Jude
 decided, after inquiry,
---
Jude not
 going by her special request
---
he
 should not lose a morning's work and pay
---
so well did he know Sue. 
---
he thought,
---
When he came home to
 dinner
---
he did not know
---
Phillotson came
 frequently, but mostly when Jude was absent. 
---
when Jude had given himself a holiday,
---
Seeing as how helpless he
 was in making the place comfortable
---
He was leaning with his elbows on the table and his chin on his
 hands,.


---
they call the man who gives
 you away
---
Jude could have said"
---
Phillotson's age entitles him!" 
---
he would not annoy her by such a cheap retort.


---
both he and she wished
---
What Jude he was aiding and
. 
---
he loved in doing a like wrong thing
---
It was on his tongue,

---
" said Jude.


---
Again he said to himself,"!"


---
He passively acquiesced in her wish, and
---
his thoughts of a penance in store for her were tempered by an
 ache:


                          
---
They strolled undemonstratively up the nave towards the altar
 railing, which they stood against in silence,, her hand still on his arm, precisely
 like a couple just married. 
---
The too suggestive incident entirely
 of her making nearly broke down Jude.


---
said Jude.


---
I shall walk down the church like this with my husband in
 about two hours, sha n't I!"


---
The appeal was so remorseful that Jude's eyes were even wetter than
 hers as he pressed her hand for Yes.


---
There was nothing
 really to demur to in her leaning on Jude's arm; but
---
Jude thought.


---
Phillotson had looked surprised
---
said Phillotson curiously.


---
Jude inwardly deplored;
 but
---
he thought
---
how puzzled Phillotson seemed
---
Seeing Jude said as cheerfully as he
 could,". 
---
I'll go on to the house with him"; and
---
Jude soon joined them at his rooms, and. 
---
Phillotson's hair was brushed to a painful
 extent, and
---
his shirt collar appeared stiffer than it had been for
 the previous twenty years. 
---
he looked dignified and
 thoughtful, and
---
it was not unsafe to predict
 that he would make a kind and considerate husband. 
---
he adored

---
the distance was so short he had hired a fly from the Red
 Lion, and six or seven women and children had gathered by the door
 when they came out. 
---
Jude was getting
---
Jude took from his pocket his extra little
 wedding- present, which turned out to be two or three yards of white
 tulle, which he threw over her bonnet and all, as a veil.


---
" Oh no-- let said Phillotson. 
---
were standing in their places
 Jude found. 
---
they were half- way on with the
 service he wished from his heart
---
he had not undertaken the
 business of giving her away
---
He
 could perceive when they reached
 the trying ordeal of Jude giving her to Phillotson she could hardly
 command herself;
---
Phillotson seemed. 
---
to be surrounded by a mist which
 prevented his seeing the emotions of others
---
As soon as come away, and Jude
 felt relieved.


---
The meal at his lodging was a very simple affair, and
---
Jude and the landlady offered.


---
Jude followed her back. 
---
VIII


 Jude wondered; or

---
He could not stay in his silent lodging, and
.


---
he might be tempted
---
he
 went upstairs,
---
he seemed, and. 
---
he fancied. 
---
that the clock struck the last of his working
 hours he threw down his tools and rushed homeward
---
he asked.


---
he could claim the downstairs sitting- room till twelve o'clock
 that night
---
As he sat in it all the evening; and
---
he could not shake off
 the feeling that she would come back and sleep in the little room
 adjoining his own in which she had slept so many previous days. 
---
Gladly
 would he have compounded for the denial of her as a sweetheart and
 wife by having her live thus as a fellow- lodger and friend, even on
 the most distant terms. 
---
His supper still remained spread, and
---
going
 to the front door, and softly setting it open he returned to the
 room and. 
---
Having indulged in this wild hope he went upstairs, and
---
he beheld,
---
He projected his mind into the future,
 and. 
---
the consolation of regarding them as a continuation of
 her identity was denied to him, as to all such dreamers, by the
 wilfulness of Nature in not allowing issue from one parent alone.

---
-- said Jude.

---
then he again uneasily saw,.


---
he had latterly seen with more and
 more frequency, the scorn of Nature for man's finer emotions, and her
 lack of interest in his aspirations
---
The oppressive strength of his affection for Sue showed itself on
 the morrow and following days yet more clearly. 
---
He could no longer
 endure the light of the Melchester lamps
---
Then he received news.

---
he would come back
---
The letters were almost a relief to him. 
---
He started, and.


---
Jude found his aunt even worse than the communication from the Widow
 Edlin. 
---
He wrote
 to Sue. 
---
He would meet her at
 Alfredston Road
---
the following evening, Monday could come by the up- train which crossed his
 down- train at that station. 
---
he went on to
 Christminster,.


---
he had lost all
 feeling for its associations. 
---
Yet as drew
 patterns of the crinkled battlements on the young turf of the
 quadrangles Jude thought. 
---
he had never seen
---
He came to the street in which he had first beheld Sue.

---
who had once moved him to emotion
---
However here he was; and
---
he went on
 to his former lodging in" Beersheba," near the ritualistic church of
 St. Silas. 
---
The old landlady seemed glad to see
 him again, and.


---
who
 had employed him
---
Jude went on to the stone- yard where he had worked. 
---
bankers were distasteful to him
---
he felt it impossible to
 engage himself to return and stay in this place of vanished dreams.

---
He longed for the hour of the homeward train to Alfredston, where he
 might probably meet Sue.


---
which had been his undoing more
 than once
---
he was not worth the trouble of being taken care of
 either by himself or others
---
he met Tinker
 Taylor, the bankrupt ecclesiastical ironmonger, at Fourways, who
 proposed that they should adjourn to a bar and drink together.

---
they stood before one of the
 great palpitating centres of Christminster life, the inn wherein he
 formerly had responded to the challenge to rehearse the Creed in
 Latin-- now a popular tavern with a spacious and inviting entrance,
 which gave admittance to a bar that had been entirely renovated and
 refitted in modern style since Jude's residence here
---
Tinker Taylor drank off his glass and. 
---
him to feel at home in
---
he was drunker

---
he had money
---
Jude was
---
Feeling tired, and having nothing more to do till Jude sat down on one of the sofas. 
---
Jude did not know the name
 of, in bottles of topaz, sapphire, ruby and amethyst
---
The barmaid attending to this compartment was invisible to Jude's
 direct glance,. 
---
a reflection of her back in the glass behind
 her was occasionally caught by his eyes
---
He had only observed this
 listlessly,. 
---
Then he was amazed to discover that the face was
 Arabella's.


---
In the compartment stood an electro- plated fountain of
 water over a spirit- lamp whose blue flame sent a steam from the top,
; which
 also reflected the faces of the men she was attending to-- one of them
 a handsome, dissipated young fellow, possibly an undergraduate, who
 had been relating to her an experience of some humorous sort.


---
all this being visible to him only in the mirror behind her
---
the young man was clean shaven
---
As the retort provoked a laugh at his expense.


---
he'll have a curaçao; and a light, please
---
have you heard from your husband lately, my dear?
---
Well, he asked.

"
---
Where is he?"


---
I left him in Australia; and
---
he's there still
---
Jude's eyes grew rounder.


---
What made you part from him?"


---
he caught her
 fingers and
---
he bade her good- bye and.


---
Jude had looked on with the eye of a dazed philosopher. 
---
It was
 extraordinary how far removed from his life
---
He could not realize their nominal closeness. 
---
he was indifferent to the fact
 that Arabella was his wife indeed.


---
he entered it, and.

---
Thanks, Arabella said Jude without a smile. 
---
her unexpected
 presence there had destroyed at a stroke his momentary taste for
 strong liquor as completely
---
it had whisked him back to his
 milk- fed infancy
---
He observed

---
So you pass as having a living husband
---
he continued.


---
He reflected and. 
---
he went out and
---
Here was a rude flounce into the pellucid sentimentality of
 his sad attachment to Sue. 
---
Though he thought. 
---
he had promised
---
pang
 had gone through him; but
---
Passing the evening therefore wherein he avoided the precincts of every
 cloister and hall,
---
he could not bear
---
he
 repaired to the tavern bar. 
---
which seemed to him gratuitous irony
---
The bar had been crowded with men of all sorts during the previous
 hour, and
---
he had heard from without the hubbub of their voices; but

---
He nodded to Arabella, and.


---
He also drank his, and.


---
thoroughly sick and tired he did not go
 by
---
who had no more sympathy than a tigress with his relations or him,
, and
---
he
 said,"."


---
Jude looked up the far
 highway.


---
he murmured at last.


---
Whenever I met him out for a walk
---
he used, and
---
he was
---
he kept. 
---
being out there in
 Australia, with no home of my own after leaving my father I at last
 agreed, and.
---
He talks of coming back to England, poor old chap. 
---
he does
---
if he wo n't be likely to find me."


---
Jude stood pale and fixed.


---
" you he said.


---
you meant him
---
replied Jude. 
---
if I shall go back
 to him! 
---
He was very fond of me, and
---
Jude watched, and. 
---
it wanted three- quarters of an hour of the time at which he could
 get a train back to Alfredston
---
Finding that
 he strolled mechanically into the
 city as far as to the Fourways, where he stood as he had so often
 stood before, and surveyed Chief Street stretching ahead, with its
 college after college, in picturesqueness unrivalled except by such
 Continental vistas as the Street of Palaces in Genoa. 
---
Jude was far from seeing or criticizing
 these things
---
But they were hidden by an indescribable consciousness of
 Arabella's midnight contiguity, a sense of degradation at his revived
 experiences with her, of her appearance. 
---
he
 could only have felt resentment towards her
---
If he would have been less
 unhappy; but
---
he pitied.


---
he contemned her
---
Jude turned and. 
---
he started at hearing his name pronounced
---
you came, and like a good angel!"


---
he had ever
 had
---
Looking at his loved one as thought, so ethereal a creature
 that trembling through her limbs he felt
 heartily ashamed of his earthliness in spending the hours. 
---
he had

---
There was something rude and immoral
 in thrusting these recent facts of his life upon the mind of one who,
 to him, was so uncarnate as to seem at times impossible as a human
 wife to any average man. 
---
he
 regarded her to- day
---
he said. 
---
He was not so sure that she had been frightened about his morals for
 nothing. 
---
He released her hand. 
---
he had lately got out of with another
---
He
 regarded the delicate lines of her profile, and the small, tight,
 applelike convexities of her bodice, so different from Arabella's
 amplitudes. 
---
he was looking at her
---
He knew that, and. 
---
the
 latter's final announcement of her marriage in Australia bewildered
 him.


---
he might say
---
what should do his ignorant wife an injury
---
whenever he wanted
---
he could not say why.

---
Jude had never before in his life gone that road with Sue,
. 
---
he had with another
---
he carried a bright
 light which temporarily banished the shady associations of the
 earlier time
---
Jude noticed. 
---
he inquired.


---
her husband were well
---
He is obliged or
---
he would have come with me. 
---
He is so good and kind
---
he would have dismissed the school for once, even
 against his principles--
---
he is strongly opposed to giving casual
 holidays
---
only I would n't let him. 
---
his would have made it irksome to both
---
Jude had walked moodily. 
---
this praise of Phillotson was being
 expressed
---
Mr. Phillotson obliges you in everything,,"

---
he ought
---
" as he said.


---
I gave you to him,
---
Jude knew the quality of every vibration
 in Sue's voice
---
he was,. 
---
you are not Mrs. Phillotson
---
No, murmured Jude. 
---
he said,.


---
When they reached the lone cottage under the firs, between the
 Brown House and Marygreen, in which Jude and Arabella had lived and
 quarrelled
---
he turned. 
---
He could not help. 
---
how he was taking it
---
he continued
 blandly.


---
Jude even may have said
 it to sting me
---
He's as good to me as a man and... 
---
he's too old for me
---
I do n't think anything against him-- to you dear."


---
He said no more, but
---
he knew.


---
wherein Jude had received a thrashing from
 the farmer many years earlier
---
you loved the man
---
I can mind the man very well. 
---
there be certain men
 here and there that no woman of any niceness can stomach. 
---
he was one
---
Jude followed her, and.


---
Do n't cry, dear said Jude in distress. 
---
you do n't like him?
---
He wondered.

---
In the afternoon to depart Jude hiring a neighbour.


---
he said.


---
The man came round with the trap, and
---
Jude
 helped her into it, perhaps with unnecessary attention,.


---
" to see you some day, he half- crossly observed.


---
said Jude. 
---
he murmured.


---
He passed the evening and. 
---
He read sermons on discipline, and. 
---
he had returned from Marygreen to Melchester
---
The sight of it revived a stronger feeling of
 self- condemnation for his brief return to her society than for his
 attachment to Sue.


---
he perceived,
---
He had come to England on purpose;
 and.


---
where he
 wished
---
he had said
---
he loved her very much still, and and,
 and
---
he urged
---
he would not turn upon her, a weak woman, and

 Jude returned to Melchester, which had the questionable
 recommendation of being only a dozen and a half miles from his Sue's
 now permanent residence. 
---
he felt; but
---
the proximity of Shaston to
 Melchester might afford him the glory of worsting the Enemy in a
 close engagement,
---
Jude did not pause.


---
He now returned with feverish desperation to his study for the
 priesthood-- in the recognition that the single- mindedness of his
 aims, and his fidelity to the cause, had been more than questionable
 of late. 
---
His passion for Sue troubled his soul;
---
yet his lawful
 abandonment to the society of Arabella for twelve hours seemed
 instinctively a worse thing--. 
---
He had. 
---
he verily believed,
---
he perceived with despondency
---
taken all round he was a man of
 too many passions to make a good clergyman
---
Yet
 that,, he could hope
 for
---
auxiliary to his readings in Divinity he developed his
 slight skill in church- music and thorough- bass,. 
---
he could join in
 part- singing from notation with some accuracy
---
Jude had

---
he had become, and
---
he joined the choir as a bass voice
---
He walked out to this parish twice every Sunday, and sometimes in the
 week. 
---
Jude had heard of as being by a Wessex composer
---
As its harmonies grew upon Jude, and.


---
he went round to the organist. 
---
He is a local man. 
---
He is a professional
 musician at Kennetbridge-- between here and Christminster. 
---
The
 vicar knows him. 
---
He was brought up and. 
---
he
 plays in the large church there
---
He comes
 to Melchester sometimes, and. 
---
he walked
---
As humming the air on his way home Jude fell to musing
 on its composer, and the reasons why he composed it. 
---
a man of
 sympathies must be! 
---
he himself was
 about Sue and Arabella, and
---
was his conscience by the
 complication of his position
---
Perplexed and harassed as troubled as how he would like!
"
---
He of all men would understand my difficulties
---
said the impulsive
 Jude. 
---
he must have suffered
---
ill he could afford the time and money for the journey,

---
Fawley resolved, like the child that he was,. 
---
He duly started, early in the morning, for it
. 
---
he could get to the
 town
---
he reached it, and
---
crossing the bridge into the
 quaint old borough he inquired for the house of the composer.


---
They told him.

---
Jude hastened on, and. 
---
Stretching out his legs yet more widely he stalked after.

---
A hungry soul in pursuit of a full soul he said. 
---
I must speak
 to that man!"


---
He could not however overtake the musician. 
---
he had entered
 his own house, and
---
not he decided
---
he had got here
---
the distance home being too great for him
---
This man of soul would understand
 scant ceremony, and.


---
an earthly and illegitimate passion had cunningly obtained
 entrance into his heart through the opening afforded for religion
---
Jude accordingly rang the bell, and.


---
The musician came to him in a moment, and
---
good- looking, and frank in manner Jude obtained a favourable
 reception. 
---
He was nevertheless conscious.


---
there would be a
 certain awkwardness in explaining his errand
---
he said. 
---
He handed Jude an advertisement list of several pages in booklet
 shape,. 
---
he purposed
---
It took Jude
 more than by surprise that the man with the soul was thus and thus;
 and
---
he felt.


---
he could not open up his confidences
---
Jude was a poor man his manner changed from what it had
 been while Jude's appearance and address deceived him as to his
 position and pursuits
---
Jude stammered out something about his
 feelings in wishing to congratulate the author on such an exalted
 composition, and.


---
did he reach
 his Melchester lodging. 
---
he found
---
he had left the house
---
It
 was a contrite little note from Sue, in which she said, with sweet
 humility, that she felt she had been horrid in telling him.


---
he
 was not,
---
he was
---
Jude almost tore his hair at having missed this letter till it was
 too late to act upon its contents; but
---
he had chastened himself
 considerably of late, and
---
he had noticed in himself more
 than once of late
---
him pass over in ridicule the idea that God
 sent people on fools' errands
---
He longed
---
to see her he was angry
 at having missed her: and
---
he wrote instantly,.


---
he had not enough patience, but
---
he wrote a little over- ardently
---
he
 might come that afternoon
---
he wished,
---
this being the earliest day
 on which she could welcome him,
---
Jude therefore got leave from the cathedral
.

SHASTON



    Whoso prefers either Matrimony or other Ordinance before

---
him profess Papist,
---
he will
---
, let
     or Protestant, or he
     is no better than a Pharisee."--J. MILTON
---
the stimulating atmosphere and
 limitless landscape around him can scarcely dispel
---
It has a unique position on the summit of a steep and imposing scarp,
 rising on the north, south, and west sides of the borough out of
 the deep alluvial Vale of Blackmoor, the view from the Castle Green
 over three counties of verdant pasture-- South, Mid, and Nether
 Wessex-- being as sudden a surprise to the unexpectant traveller's
 eyes as the medicinal air is to his lungs. 
---
Shaston was remarkable for three consolations
 to man, such as
---
It was to this breezy and whimsical spot that Jude ascended from the
 nearest station for the first time in his life about four o'clock one
 afternoon, and. 
---
he withdrew a few
 steps along Abbey Walk,. 
---
he regarded the spot
---
which fate had
 made the home of all he loved best in the world
---
he
 could see the black, brown, and flaxen crowns of the scholars over
 the sills, and
---
he walked down to the level
 terrace where the abbey gardens once had spread.


---
his heart throbbing
 in spite of him
---
Unwilling to enter till he remained here

---
Retracing his steps he found.


---
he
 had waited too long, and
---
Mr. Phillotson having been absent all the
 afternoon at a teachers' meeting at Shottsford
---
Jude went into the empty schoolroom and. 
---
Mrs. Phillotson would be
 back again in a few minutes
---
Phillotson had possessed at Marygreen
---
Jude touched them in
 his humble way
---
actually the old
 piano that-- and though the dark
 afternoon almost prevented him seeing the notes, and could not help
---
A figure moved behind him, and
---
Jude took no notice,. 
---
The imposed hand was a
 little one he seemed to know, and
---
he turned.


---
her rendering of the piece, though not remarkable seemed divine as compared with his own. 
---
he moved his hand towards hers,
---
it met his own
 half- way.
---
Jude grasped it--.


---
just he had done before her marriage
---
Is n't it enough to make one blaspheme
 that the composer of that hymn is one of the most commonplace men I
 ever met!"


---
you know him?"


---
Because he said drily.


---
He waited in the light of the stove,
---
said Jude.


---
The kettle of his gift sang with some satire in its note, to his
 mind; and
---
he said,"? 
---
His thoughts however reverted with
 a twinge to the" former friend"--by whom she meant,. 
---
he knew, the
 university comrade of her earlier days
---
He wondered.

"
---
Jude do take an interest in those
 questions still? 
---
" said Jude.


---
he saw by the kettle- flame that her face was flushed.


---
But Jude ca n't understand
 me!... 
---
my husband is not at home."


---
He had hardly gone
 from the door. 
---
he was passing
 in the path without
---
He looked up in some surprise. "
---
You are Joseph the dreamer of
 dreams, dear Jude. 
---
sometimes you
 are St. Stephen, who, while they were stoning him, could see Heaven
 opened. 
---
he could not
 get at her
---
I
 am called Mrs. Richard Phillotson,. 
---
I am not really Mrs. Richard
 Phillotson, but unaccountable antipathies... 
---
" Yes! said Jude. 
---
Jude said good- bye,
 and.


---
Passing along he thought. 
---
he heard, and, truly enough,
---
when he reached the Duke's Arms
 in the Market Place
---
him
 to get to the station on foot in time for this train
---
he settled
 himself perforce.


---
He wandered about awhile, then,
---
his feet involuntarily took him
 through the venerable graveyard of Trinity Church, with its avenues
 of limes, in the direction of the schools again. 
---
He could see the interior clearly--. 
---
,
, was standing with her hat on in this front
 parlour or sitting- room whose walls were lined with wainscoting
 of panelled oak reaching from floor to ceiling
---
he could see her face distinctly, and.


---
Jude turned away. "
---
Whose photograph he said. 
---
He
 had once given her his; but
---
he knew. 
---
it was his,
 surely?


---
He knew,.

---
he should go
---
he read of, the saints, whom Sue, with gentle
 irreverence, called his demi- gods
---
Those earnest men, would have shunned such encounters
. 
---
he could not. 
---
He might fast
 and pray during the whole interval, but
---
the human was more powerful
 in him than the Divine.




---
one
 brought him this note from her:


   . 
---
He knew her mood, the look of her face,
 when she subscribed herself at length thus. 
---
whatever her mood he
 could not say.
---
He replied:


   . 
---
He despatched the note on Easter Eve, and
---
he received a message from the
 Widow Edlin, whom he had directed to telegraph. 
---
He threw down his tools and. 
---
Three and a half hours later he
 was crossing the downs about Marygreen, and.

---
he ascended on the other side a labouring man, who had been

---
I can see in his face
---
" that said Jude. 
---
he had supposed
---
Mrs. Edlin had sent out the man to
 break the news to him.


---
;
 that said he.


---
Jude went on to the house, and
---
in the afternoon, done, and gone he sat
 down alone in the silent place. 
---
He wrote in the briefest terms:


   .
   
---
He remained in and about Marygreen through the intervening days,
. 
---
Having
 timed her by her only possible train he locked the door about
 mid- day, and.

---
where he stood and
---
There was a long time to wait, even now, till he would know if she
 had arrived. 
---
He did wait, however, and
---
He knew her; and
---
him to give
---
he knew. 
---
he met her.


---
" Dear faithful Sue!" murmured Jude.


---
Jude would have paused, and
---
Her eyes met his, and.


---
he guessed things--"merely? 
---
Jude threw a troubled look at her. 
---
He said,:". 
---
Speaking as an order- loving man-- which though
 I should say, yes. 
---
I did n't tell him."


---
Jude went to the widow's house adjoining,; and

---
he said
 abruptly, with his eyes bent to the floor.


---
Jude put his upon it. 
---
cried he," after what we've been talking about!

---
I must tell him."


---
it means nothing
 it may be bothering him needlessly."


---
just you live with your husband
---
said
 Jude, in a softened tone.


---
not I should have a right to dislike him! 
---
He is considerate to me in
 everything; and
---
he is very interesting, from the amount of general
 knowledge he has acquired by reading everything that comes in his
 way.... 
---
Jude ought
---
I am than
 he
---
He gave her no opportunity of self- satisfaction, and
---
though I
 like Mr. Phillotson as a friend I do n't like him
---
, it is a torture to
 me to-- live with him as a husband!--There, now
---
Jude could hardly speak, but
---
he said,! 
---
is the necessity
 of being responsive to this man whenever he wishes, good as he is
 morally!--the dreadful contract to feel in a particular way in a
 matter
---
he would beat
 me, or
---
he does nothing,
. 
---
he has grown a little cold
---
he has found out
---
why he did n't come to the funeral
---
he had jumped up and.


---
I told you not to, Jude!"


---
Jude did not follow her. 
---
Twenty minutes later he
 saw, and
---
Jude sat.

---
He knew.


---
He retired, but
---
his sleep was fitful from the sense
 that Sue was so near at hand. 
---
when
 he was beginning
---
to sleep more soundly he was aroused by a shrill
 squeak that had been familiar enough to him when he lived regularly
 at Marygreen. 
---
He in his childhood began.

---
Jude
 could rest no longer, and
---
he had put it out of its pain
---
he descended,
---
He reached the hedge
 bordering the widow's garden,. 
---
when he stood still
---
he struck the rabbit on the back of the neck
 with the side of his palm
---
He was turning away.
" Jude!"
---
when he saw
---
Jude had reached the window, which was quite a low one,. 
---
he said.


---
Do n't wish it, dear he said. 
---
Jude seized her hand and. 
---
he said. 
---
I married
 him
---
Jude before had never thought out fully,. 
---
he could
 not put his arms round her,
---
otherwise he unquestionably would have

---
he returned to his cottage.




---
III


 Sue's distressful confession recurred to Jude's mind all the night as
 being a sorrow indeed.


---
he returned along the same route, and. 
---
it was hardly proper of him as a parson in
 embryo
---
he
 now wished
---
it was with flushed cheeks on her side, and a beating heart on his.


---
The kiss was a turning- point in Jude's career. 
---
Back again in the
 cottage, and left to reflection he saw one thing: that though
 his kiss of that aerial being had seemed the purest moment of his
 faultful life, as long as he nourished this unlicensed tenderness it
 was glaringly inconsistent for him to pursue the idea of becoming the
 soldier and servant of a religion in which sexual love was regarded
 as at its best a frailty, and at its worst damnation. 
---
he thought of
---
he was

---
He was as unfit, obviously, by nature,,.


---
he had been by
 social position
---
his first aspiration-- towards academical
 proficiency-- had been checked by a woman, and
---
his second
 aspiration-- towards apostleship-- had also been checked by a woman
---
he said,"
---
It had been his standing desire to become a prophet, however humble,
 to his struggling fellow- creatures, without any thought of personal
 gain. 
---
the loved one's revolt against her state
 being possibly on his account
---
he had sunk.


---
him to consider further
---
for he had only.


---
he had made himself quite an impostor as a
 law- abiding religious teacher
---
he went into the garden and
---
he brought out all the theological and ethical works that
 he possessed, and. 
---
He knew. 
---
even he should sacrifice a little money to the sentiment of
 thus destroying them
---
Lighting some loose pamphlets to begin with he cut the volumes into pieces as well as he could,. 
---
he was almost a stranger here now,
---
he
 turned and
---
as turned the paper shreds with the fork the sense of being
 no longer a hypocrite to himself afforded his mind a relief which
 gave him calm
---
He might go on, but
---
he professed
 nothing, and. 
---
he might naturally be supposed
---
he could not stand as
 an ordinary sinner, and not as a whited sepulchre.


---
him kiss her
---
Jude ought. 
---
he was not a
 lover, and
---
I wo n't write to him any more, or at least
 for a long time,! 
---
it will
 hurt him very much--, and the
 next
---
He'll suffer then with
 suspense-- won't he, that's all!--and
---
I am very glad of it!"--Tears
 of pity for Jude's approaching sufferings at her hands mingled with
 those which had surged up in pity for herself.


---
Phillotson met her at the arrival station, and,. 
---
He began,
 and how his friend Gillingham, a neighbouring schoolmaster whom he
 had not seen for years, had called upon him. 
---
Mr. Fawley hold my hand a long while
---
He waking apparently from thoughts of far different mould said
 vaguely,"
---
He wanted to, and
---
I let him."


---
it pleased him
---
he might have entered on his notes
---
Phillotson sat.

---
When
 Phillotson arrived upstairs,
---
he went
 to the window, and,. 
---
He was musing,"
---
he said at last,
 without turning his head,". 
---
he went on:

"
---
As ordinarily he turned round.

---
he said.


---
Thinking gone downstairs for a moment to
 see to it he pulled off his coat and
---
, he went out upon the
 landing, candle in hand, and!"


---
" Yes!" came back to him in her voice, from the distant kitchen
 quarter.


---
He went to bed. 
---
he awoke. 
---
Lighting a candle he hastily stepped out upon the landing,
 and.


---
whence they came he could not at first understand. 
---
Phillotson alarmed went towards it,.


---
What he asked.


---
But--"  Phillotson seized the knob and. 
---
When he looked in upon her
---
he was quite worried
---
He said:"!"


---
He meant the servant.) 
---
he immediately looked into the closet, but

---
he said
 bitterly.


---
He found
---
" Richard said all at once;?"


---
I took his word."


---
HE would n't have inquired!
---
a man and woman to live on intimate
 terms. 
---
" What moaned he. 
---
The ringing of the school bell saved Phillotson from the necessity of
 replying at present to what apparently did not strike him as being
 such a convincing_
---
he was ready to throw in with her
 other little peculiarities the extremest request which a wife could
 make
---
where he could see the back of her head through the
 glass partition
---
whenever he turned his eyes that way
---
he went on
 giving and hearing lessons his forehead and eyebrows twitched from
 concentrated agitation of thought, till at length
---
As he tore a scrap
 from a sheet of scribbling paper and. 
---
He folded the piece of paper very small, and. 
---
Phillotson saw. 
---
He could not see
 her hands, but
---
however one of Sue's
 class appeared, with a little note similar to his own. 
---
Phillotson looked more disturbed than before, and
---
the meeting- place
 of his brows twitched again. 
---
he called up the child

---
he had just sent to her, and
---
me go to him
---
he returned no answer.


---
then he returned an answer:


   . 
---
Phillotson bent a dazed regard upon her through the glazed
 partition; and
---
he felt as lonely as when he had not known her.


---
he was as good as his word, and. 
---
his talking pertinently
---
IV


 Phillotson was sitting up late,,. 
---
he felt a
 return of his old interest in it. 
---
He forgot time and place, and
---
when
 he remembered himself and
---
His preoccupation was such that, though he now slept on the other
 side of the house, he mechanically went to the room that he and his
 wife had occupied when he first became a tenant of Old- Grove Place,
 which since his differences with Sue had been hers exclusively.

---
He entered, and.


---
where he was
---
Before he perceived Sue. 
---
he heard
---
he had thought. 
---
he heard.


---
Phillotson horrified ran downstairs,. 
---
Opening the heavy door he ascended
 the two or three steps to the level of the ground, and. 
---
Phillotson seized it in his
 arms, and.


---
" her pale face still turned away
 from him. "
---
the wretched
 Phillotson flung it round her. "
---
he asked
 drearily;
---
to lock your door he mechanically said,. 
---
Phillotson did not approach her, or attempt to ascend himself. 
---
he
 heard
---
Then he fastened up the front door, and

---
Thus he remained for a
 long long time-- a pitiable object enough to one who had seen him
---
the business of his life must be carried on
---
he had a wife or

---
he took the candle and.


---
Phillotson
 walked out of Shaston,. 
---
he required no tea, and
---
where he was going
---
He descended from the town level by a steep
 road in a north- westerly direction, and.

---
He was now on the low alluvial beds


    Where Duncliffe is the traveller's mark,
    And
---
he looked back in the increasing obscurity of evening
---
as if
 watching him one of which windows was his own. 
---
he could
 just discern the pinnacled tower of Trinity Church. 
---
when he had walked a
 mile or two
---
soft and relaxing he was obliged.


---
Leaving Duncliffe Hill on the left he proceeded without hesitation
 through the shade,
---
a man goes on, night or day
---
as he has played as a boy. 
---
He had walked altogether about four
 and a half miles


    Where Stour receives her strength,
    From six cleere fountains fed,[ Drayton.]


, and.


---
when he crossed a tributary of the Stour
---
where he went
 on to the boys' school
---
he was,
---
he could
---
He
 discovered. 
---
his friend putting away some books
---
he had been

---
The light of the paraffin lamp fell on
 Phillotson's face-- pale and wretched by contrast with his friend's,
 who had a cool, practical look. 
---
though her exact
 feeling for him is a riddle to me-- and
---
He is her cousin, which perhaps
 accounts for some of it. 
---
a husband gets such
 a so- called preposterous request from his wife, the only course that
 can possibly be regarded as right and proper and honourable in him
---
been the man knelt to and
---
I
 have been that man, and
---
one has any manliness or chivalry in him
---
It is not the same thing at
 all as the treachery of living on with a husband and playing him
 false... 
---
, living with him
 as wife though to the best of my
 understanding, feeling between
 the two that is the worst of it;. 
---
said Phillotson sadly. 
---
He went under the stairs, and. 
---
" rafted, he continued. 
---
Gillingham accompanied his friend a mile on his way, and. 
---
Stick to her!"
 were his last words,
---
" flung into the darkness after Phillotson his friend answered" Aye, aye!"


---
when Phillotson was alone under the clouds of night, and
---
he said,
---
he walked back alone
---
Phillotson told Sue:

". 
---
it seemed to Phillotson more
 and more indubitably the true one
---
he was doing his duty by a woman who was at his mercy
---
His mild serenity at the sense
 that almost
 overpowered his grief at relinquishing her.


---
How permanently it was imprinted upon his
 vision
---
lest he might have been interpreted by a stranger as displeasure.


---
that
 Phillotson intruded his presence on her for the few brief minutes
 that remained
---
he helped her to; and
---
they sat
 trivial questions of housekeeping, such as where he would find the
 key of this or that cupboard, what little bills were paid, and what
 not
---
as he said, in a heroic
 attempt to put her at her ease. 
---
it might be to other men who have
 had one a little while
---
Phillotson mused, and. 
---
Jude will let"

.

---
I would rather not know anything about him,
---
I have only a small parcel that will go into
 Jude's portmanteau."


---
It is a curious thing
 that directly I have begun to regard you as not my husband, but
---
Phillotson saw
 her things put on the top,. 
---
he wished her good- bye, which she quite
 understood and imitated
---
they
 parted the omnibus- man
---
When Phillotson got back into the house
---
he went upstairs and. 
---
He came down then
---
his face compressed like
 that of one bearing pain
---
, he put on his hat and. 
---
Suddenly turning round he came
 home.


---
He had.


---
that's the plate
 she--"  Phillotson's throat got choked up, and
---
he could not go on.

---
He turned and.

"
---
he asked presently in a renewed
 voice.


---
There was a stability, a ballast, in Phillotson's pronouncement which
 restrained his friend's comment. 
---
"-- he asked.


---
he continued. 
---
Some men would have stopped at an agreement to separate."


---
Phillotson
 closed the box and.


---
There he said. 
---
Richard and I thought. 
---
He has
    been so VERY kind to me through it all!

   
---
He entered the compartment
 promptly. 
---
He had a black bag in his hand, and.

---
he wore on Sundays and in the evening after work
---
Altogether he looked a very handsome young fellow, his ardent
 affection for her burning in his eyes.


---
He has been so good in letting me go
---
He's not an unworthy fellow
---
said Jude,.

---
I am ashamed of myself for hating him."

"
---
he married you
---
he has let,
---
I am so cold, or devoid of gratitude, or
 so something, that even this generosity hasn't made me love him, or
 repent, or want to stay with him as his wife
---
" But I do feel I
 like his large- mindedness, and respect him more than ever."


---
he had been less kind, and
---
you
 had run away against his will
---
if murmured Jude
---
Jude's eyes rested musingly on her face. 
---
Then he suddenly kissed
 her; and. 
---
" he answered; but. 
---
Jude continued after a silence. 
---
Jude's eyes fixed themselves with
 a stultified expression on the opposite seat. "
---
he
 said... " Well!"


---
He remained in silence; and!"


---
how discomfited he was
---
" Oh-- he said. 
---
his brow showed perplexity. 
---
the father of a woman's child will be as much a private matter of
 hers as the cut of her underlinen
---
partly, perhaps, it is by his
 generosity
---
he had run after
 us with pistols
---
He repeated simply! 
---
Phillotson thought so. 
---
he has written to me
---
He opened the letter. 
---
He's a good fellow
---
is n't he!"
---
He was very resigned to letting me
 go--
---
I never was so near being in love with him
 as when he made such thoughtful arrangements for my being comfortable
 on my journey, and offering to provide money. 
---
I
 loved him ever so little as a wife
---
If I'd go back to him even now."


---
he said pettishly. 
---
He leant back, and. 
---
That
 episode in her past history of which had told him-- of the poor
.


---
Christminster graduate whom returned to Jude's
 mind; and
---
he saw himself as a possible second in such a torturing
 destiny
---
he murmured. 
---
Perhaps you are making
 a cat's paw of me with Phillotson all this time. 
---
He could never resist her).
---
your marrying Phillotson because of a stupid
 scandal, that under the affectation of independent views you are as
 enslaved to the social code as any woman I know
---
I did n't marry him altogether because of the scandal.

---
him suffering
---
you flirted outrageously with him, poor old
 chap, and and
---
He could see! 
---
As Jude
 inquired for another; and a youth who volunteered to find one wheeled
 their luggage to the George farther on, which proved to be the inn at
 which Jude had stayed with Arabella on that one occasion of their
 meeting after their division for years.


---
Owing however he did not recognize the place. 
---
he
 is,
---
your relation, or friend, or whatever coming here once before-- late, just like this, with his wife-- a
 lady, at any rate
---
When Jude came back and
---
Jude said to him plaintively, at their parting
 that night upon the landing,"! 
---
Jude looking round him
---
you had met as estranged people, who were not husband
 and wife at all in Heaven's sight--
---
he said sadly. 
---
After all you were on good terms with your
 husband at that time."


---
said Jude. 
---
he did not understand her feelings very well
---
he did a little; and.


---
said Jude, as distressed as
 she.


---
said Jude distantly.


---
a parting such as yours from her, and mine from him ended
 the marriage
---
" to do that said he. 
---
He laughed. 
---
Never mind he said. 
---
he replied mournfully.


---
he
 did. 
---
Yes, sweet he said with a sigh; and.




---
Phillotson
 had won the interest and. 
---
who did not honour him for his miscellaneous acquirements
,
---
he would have been honoured elsewhere
---
When shortly he brought home a pretty
 wife--
---
he did not take care
---
, after his arrival, awkwardly pretty for him if they
 said.


---
Phillotson casually admitted to an acquaintance that he did not know
 where his wife was staying
---
The schoolmaster's growing languor
 and listlessness over his work gave countenance to the idea.


---
Phillotson had held his tongue as long as he could, except to
 his friend Gillingham, his honesty and directness
---
him
 to do so
---
the chairman of the school committee called, and
 drew Phillotson aside
 out of earshot of the children.


---
Do n't said Phillotson. 
---
he had not apprehended the remark
---
" Phillotson continued testily. 
---
much seriousness marked the faces of
 the two men, and
---
something
 new had happened about Mrs. Phillotson
---
Then Phillotson's little
 maidservant,, said
. 
---
Mr. Phillotson had helped in his wife's packing,
---
a request came to Phillotson
---
Gillingham
 was sitting in his house.


---
observed Phillotson,. 
---
however Phillotson would not listen.


---
he said. 
---
his rather headstrong friend would not be able to
 maintain such a position as this
---
he said nothing further, and
 in due time-- indeed, in a quarter of an hour--
---
he should not
 accept dismissal; and
---
he attended
---
he looked so weak and ill
---
his friend implored him
---
When he stood up
---
to give his reasons for contesting
 the decision of the managers he advanced them firmly,. 
---
he had

---
it touched the morals of those he
 taught
---
Phillotson replied.


---
he did not see
---
All the respectable inhabitants and were against Phillotson to a man. 
---
some dozen or more champions rose up in his defence as from
 the ground.


---
Phillotson had never spoken to one of these
 gentlemen they now nobly led the forlorn hope in his defence.

---
, whose own domestic experiences, came up and warmly shook hands with Phillotson they expressed their thoughts so strongly to the meeting. 
---
,,
 a churchwarden was dealt such a topper with the map of Palestine
 that his head went right through Samaria, and many black eyes and
 bleeding noses were given, one of which, to everybody's horror
---
who took the side of Phillotson's party
---
When
 Phillotson saw
---
he deplored
 almost in groans the untoward and degrading circumstances,.


---
he had not resigned, and
---
he could not leave his bed
---
The farcical yet melancholy event was the beginning of a serious
 illness for him; and
---
he lay in his lonely bed in the pathetic state
 of mind of a middle- aged man who perceives at length that his
 life, intellectual and domestic, is tending to failure and gloom.

---
said Phillotson. 
---
at least he was living there some time
 ago."


---
he sat and. 
---
the letter being enclosed in an envelope addressed to Jude at the
 diocesan capital
---
Arriving at that place it was forwarded to
 Marygreen in North Wessex, and thence to Aldbrickham by the only
 person who knew his present address-- the widow who had nursed his
 aunt.


---
Three days later, making the Shaston
 windows like tongues of fire to the eyes of the rustics in that vale the sick man fancied. 
---
he heard and
---
Phillotson
 did not speak
---
He turned his eyes upon her, and;
 but.


---
you recognize other feelings between man and woman than physical
 love
---
what troubles
 had resulted to him from letting her go
---
when his tea was

---
he told the amazed little servant. 
---
the beams were reflected into Phillotson's
 face
---
Phillotson smiled sadly. 
---
he murmured. 
---
the sun glowed in his eyes
---
Jude does n't know
---
he was
 out;
---
said Phillotson huskily. 
---
it to flit through his
---
when he
 said," Sue
---
He had noticed.


---
to recall her he knew it.

---
he pursued it
---
he could not help it. 
---
he murmured,
---
HE is your husband now. 
---
He is obtaining a divorce from his wife
 Arabella."

" His wife! 
---
He is not doing it so much on his own account as on
 hers. 
---
Jude has agreed."


---
There had arisen in Sue's face that incipient fright which showed
 itself whenever he changed from friend to husband, and which made her
 adopt any line of defence against marital feeling in him. 
---
said Phillotson; but. 
---
The dread of a
 reactionary change in the schoolmaster's sentiments, coupled,
 perhaps, with a faint shamefacedness at letting even him know
 what a slipshod lack of thoroughness, from a man's point of view
---
Phillotson lay
.


---
he pictured the prettily dressed
---
who bore his name,

---
Gillingham was so interested in Phillotson's affairs, and so
 seriously concerned about him, that he walked up the hill- side to
 Shaston two or three times a week,. 
---
When he called on the
 next occasion and

---
his friend was downstairs,
---
his restless mood had been supplanted by a
 more fixed and composed one
---
since said Phillotson.


---
is some news she brought me-- the news
 that Fawley is doing the same
---
he had a spouse, too? 
---
he said gently,.

---
he respected views he could not share
---
They had met, as usual, to breakfast together in the little house
 with Jude's name on it,. 
---
he had taken at fifteen pounds a year,
 with three- pounds- ten extra for rates and taxes, and
---
which had cost him about
 their full value to bring all the way from Marygreen
---
he entered the room this morning
---
he said after kissing her.


---
That the decree_ nisi_ in the case of Phillotson_ versus pronounced six months ago
---
Jude sat down
---
The same concluding incident in Jude's suit against Arabella had
 occurred about a month or two earlier. 
---
He looked at
 his sweetheart curiously.

" Are we-- you and I-- just as free now as if we had never married at
 all?"


---
he said mischievously.


---
Jude agreed, and
---
Jude put on a lighter tie
---
he said,"
---
others said he, with some gloom;". 
---
as I
 trust you more than any other man in the world."


---
he expostulated;
---
Apart from ourselves it is foreign
 to a man's nature. 
---
when he is told
---
he must and
---
There would be a much
 likelier chance of his doing it. 
---
he were told
---
No doubt my father and
 mother, and your father and mother saw it,. 
---
Jude fell back upon his old complaint--
---
as he had never once had from her an honest, candid declaration that she
 loved or could love him. 
---
I really fear sometimes that you can not,"
 he said, with a dubiousness approaching anger. 
---
they
 must never admit the full truth to a man
---
he has had
 tender relations with
---
a man's heart returns closest to her
---
The better class of man,
 if is
---
he had latterly occupied himself on his own account
 in working and lettering headstones,, and. 
---
he kept in a little yard
 at the back of his little house, where in the intervals of domestic
 duties she marked out the letters full size for him
---
he had cut them
---
his only
 patrons were the poor people who lived in his own neighbourhood,
 and knew what a cheap man this" Jude Fawley: Monumental Mason"
( as he called himself on his front door)
---
he seemed more
 independent than before, and
---
it was the only arrangement under which
 Sue, who particularly wished to be no burden on him, could render any
 assistance.




---
Jude had just returned
 home from hearing a lecture on ancient history in the public hall not
 far off. 
---
When he entered
---
who had been keeping indoors during
 his absence
---
Jude had taken up some illustrated paper, which he perused
 till,
---
he saw.


---
he said.


---
when
 Jude had finished
---
his he prepared
---
He had
---
said Jude.

---
He accordingly went into his bedroom and. 
---
" Who's there he asked.


---
Is that Mr. Fawley?"
---
Jude replied.


---
said Jude. 
---
" What he inquired.


---
But he said.


---
he asked, in a
 distinctly softened tone.


---
, said Jude in much perplexity. 
---
But said Jude. 
---
He turned to the stairs.

"
---
And said Jude.


---
Well,, come to that he said,. 
---
hear what no man could do less!"


---
There was that in his manner which she knew it would be futile to
 oppose. 
---
him go downstairs, unbolt the door, and
---
he did not return in fourteen minutes

---
If he would have lingered. 
---
He MIGHT enter the inn with Arabella,
---
him to drink with
 her
---
what disasters would befall him then
---
Jude appeared
---
he said,
---
her arms round his neck
---
he embracing Sue softly
---
He kissed her on one side, and on the other, and in the
 middle, and rebolted the front door.




---
" Oh yes: said Jude placidly.


---
the request did not surprise him
---
he added,". 
---
Jude kiss
 her freely,
---
" No-- only nested he assured her.


---
her predecessor in Jude's affections would recognize
 her
---
Jude could behold her forerunner now, with the daylight
 full upon her
---
my visitor was-- your friend-- your
 husband-- Mrs
---
even he's not really yours
---
He is mine,!"


---
He was n't yesterday."


---
just
 it had done in Jude's time
---
My man finds, and. 
---
he ca n't do without me after all
---
he has made me
 all along
---
He asks
 me. 
---
His little corner public in Lambeth would go to
 pieces without me
---
he says. 
---
he is n't going!... 
---
when he has had a drop,
---
I should coax Jude, and
---
He's waiting to, any day
---
Life with a man is more
 businesslike after it, and. 
---
he turns you out of doors
---
you can get unless he half- runs
 you through with a knife, or cracks your noddle with a poker. 
---
he bolts away from you
---
a man med
---
I shall marry my
 man over again
---
now he's willing,. 
---
In my telegram last night this I told him
---
I had almost made it up with Jude; and
---
that frightened
 him
---
Jude is
---
Just he used. 
---
he is asking me
---
It was
 quite by my wish that he did n't the moment
---
I told him
---
Would he run up? 
---
I'll write to him about it. 
---
He saw
.


---
me feel more than ever how hopelessly vulgar an institution legal
 marriage is-- a sort of trap to catch a man-- I ca n't bear to think
 of it
---
who
 now has a right to his freedom
---
we were deceiving him
 before
---
His hand was raised!"


---
He looked round.

"
---
He came back to her.


---
And"

" What Arabella he asked.


---
you could get
 the law of a man better... 
---
he beat you-- and how when couples
 quarrelled
---
Jude do think? 
---
The men and women
 of our family are very generous, but
---
he
 was
---
he did not turn awhile
---
He looked and. 
---
the marked advertisement was simply the announcement
 of a marriage at St. John's Church, Waterloo Road, under the names,
".

"
---
how
 he is getting on
---
Jude's attention was still absorbed. 
---
Having merely glanced
 at the announcement he said in a disturbed voice:". 
---
Mr.
    Fawley),--I send to- day a newspaper,
---
Jude,, there was a boy born of our
    marriage,. 
---
he has been with them ever since. 
---
He is now of an intelligent age, of
    course, and
---
his
    parents being alive
---
I would have him with me here in
    a moment, but
---
he is not old enough to be of any use in
    the bar nor
---
naturally
    Cartlett might think him in the way. 
---
They have however packed him off to me in charge of some friends who
    happened to be coming home, and
---
when he arrives,
---
He is lawfully yours,. 
---
he is n't
---
Jude did not reply, and
---
his birth was
---
Certainly if exactly he's mine. 
---
Jude had by this time. 
---
he
 must have, mine or not mine
---
What a view of life he said. 
---
he might
 be
---
I would take him and. 
---
we'll have him here! 
---
he is n't yours
---
I do hope he isn't--
---
he is n't
---
you must assume about him, my
 curious little comrade!
---
" Well, he said. 
---
who does n't want him
---
all its evil influences, with a
 parent, and has, indeed hardly seen him, and
 a stepfather who does n't know him
---
the boy-- MY boy, perhaps will find
---
himself
 saying before long
---
As I am really entitled to his custody
---
we must have him. 
---
when he'll arrive
---
When shall we have courage to marry, Jude?"


---
the boy comes?"


---
It would make a more natural home for him, perhaps
---
Jude thereupon wrote in purely formal terms nor
---
the boy
 should be sent on to them as soon as he arrived,
---
, had he known all this
---
his conduct towards her would have
 been quite the same.


---
He had large,
 frightened eyes, and.

---
a
 key was suspended round his neck by a piece of common string
---
his half- ticket was stuck. 
---
His eyes
 remained.

---
these the
 fellow- passengers laughed, except the solitary boy bearing the key
 and ticket, who, regarding the kitten with his saucer eyes, seemed
 mutely to say:. 
---
The boy would say," Yes," without animation,.


---
He was. 
---
his real self showed through crevices
---
when his face took a back view over some great Atlantic
 of Time, and
---
the boy remained just as before
---
He then
 seemed.


---
he saw their whole
 rounded lives rather than their immediate figures
---
This was Arabella's boy. 
---
he had come,

---
as dispatched him to Jude by the next train,

---
her husband Cartlett, not to see him
---
the boy was deposited on the
 lonely platform beside his box. 
---
The collector took his ticket, and,

---
where
 he was going by himself at that time of night
---
further the boy came out into the street,. 
---
When he
 had walked some little distance he asked for the street of his
 destination. 
---
He was told.


---
He followed his directions literally, without an
 inquiring gaze at anything. 
---
the boy's
 ideas of life were different from those of the local boys
---
The boy seemed
, and. 
---
He found the way to the little lane, and. 
---
Jude had just retired to bed, and
---
where Father lives
---
that's his name."


---
he hurried down as soon
 as he could, though to her impatience.


---
he seemed long
---
is it he-- so soon
---
Jude came
---
Jude lifted the boy to a level with
 himself, and. 
---
he would have been met,
---
they had known of his coming so soon
---
he went
---
he knew
---
He found her in the
 dark,. 
---
He enclosed her with his arm, and

---
I see you in him!"


---
the other half of him is-- SHE! 
---
perhaps I can carry out
 through him
---
The boy looked at her.

---
he inquired.


---
Do I look like your father's wife?"


---
he seems fond of you, and you of him. 
---
he began. 
---
where he soon fell asleep
---
he lay
---
He called you Mother two or three times,"
. 
---
he dropped off
---
he should have wanted to
---
His face is like the tragic mask of Melpomene
---
these preternaturally old boys almost always come from new
 countries
---
said his father with some
 disappointment.


---
The boy shook his head. "
---
him christened
---
said Jude; and privately to Sue:" The
 day we are married." 
---
the advent of the child disturbed him.


---
Jude Fawley signed the form of notice, Sue looking over his shoulder
 and watching his hand as it traced the words. 
---
, into which
 Jude's names by which that very
 volatile essence,, to be
 made permanent her face seemed.

---
is he? 
---
him go and and
---
he
 die in the battle,
---
another man take her
---
people thought him hers, and
---
Meanwhile Jude decided by inviting to the wedding the only person remaining on
 earth who was associated with his early life at Marygreen-- the aged
 widow Mrs. Edlin, who had been his great- aunt's friend and nurse in
 her last illness. 
---
He hardly expected; but
---
he never spoke
---
as they were
 hardly conscious of him.


---
how he is told of
---
he WERE one of your family
---
What said Jude.


---
he was gibbeted just on the brow of
 the hill by the Brown House-- not far from the milestone between
 Marygreen and Alfredston, where the other road branches off. 
---
to have stood, very well murmured
 Jude. 
---
What-- did this man my ancestor
 and Sue's--?"


---
He wanted
 the body,, but
---
where his people lay
---
Her husband then came in the night with a cart, and; but. 
---
he was
---
he broke in for
---
why he was hanged and
---
he was dead
---
he belonged to ye more than to me
---
If I would n't marry Father
---
they had forgotten him
---
I vowed in to my other husband,
 and you to me in the same as you used to your other wife
---
If said he. 
---
the twain and their friends
 straggled out, one of the witnesses saying casually to Jude and Sue
 in passing,? 
---
he had known them before
---
went forward in front
 of Jude and Sue whose diffidence was increasing. 
---
" Dear little girl said Jude. 
---
He spoke to the clerk, and. 
---
No-- unless he said. 
---
he'll give
 us
---
Jude went up and. "
---
-- he said. 
---
Jude said.


---
he also thought
---
His betrothed shuddered; and? 
---
he indeed
 felt
---
since said Jude. 
---
While he went on to
 confess that,
---
he thought
---
though to be able to do it he
 felt perhaps,. 
---
he declared.


---
He gave her a little kiss behind a pillar; and
---
the new husband and wife came into the open
 daylight. 
---
Still it is no worse for the woman than for the man. 
---
That's
 and instead of protesting against the
 conditions they protest against the man, the other victim; just as a
 woman in a crowd will abuse the man who crushes against her, when he
 is only the helpless transmitter of the pressure put upon him."


---
some are like that, instead of uniting with the man against
 the common enemy, coercion." 
---
when he comes in
---
He'll think, and
---
it will be better that he
 should not be surprised and puzzled. 
---
V


 does not require him
.

---
when the unexpected apparition of Jude's child
 in the house had shown itself but
---
To be sure, with such pleasing anxious beings as the boy's
 coming also brought with it much thought for the future,. 
---
particularly
 he seemed at present
---
the two roads
 which part in his town ever meet again
---
The man was about to hire a fly as some
 others had done,. 
---
said, in a thick
 voice, her husband, the landlord of The Three Horns, Lambeth
---
he, too, like his
 customers, was becoming affected by the liquors he retailed
---
Do n't you recognize the man?"


---
he was inclined for a little sight- seeing like
 the rest of us
---
Cartlett's interest in Jude whatever been,, her supernumerary hair- coils, and her
 optional dimples,.


---
Mr.
 Cartlett had no other idea than that his wife's child by her first
 husband.


---
Not regardful of themselves alone they had taken care to bring Father Time, to try every means of
 making him kindle and laugh like other boys, though he was to
 some extent a hindrance to the delightfully unreserved intercourse
 in their pilgrimages which they so much enjoyed. 
---
Jude was really proud of her companionship, not
 more for her external attractiveness than for her sympathetic words
 and ways. 
---
a passing sadness would touch their
 faces at their every failure to disturb his indifference
---
he did marry her
---
he was going to
---
I should be ashamed of
 making myself so silly if I were he!"


---
He's charmed by her!" continued Arabella.
"
---
how he looks round at her, and
---
his eyes rest on her
---
I am
 inclined to think that she do n't care for him quite so much as he
 does for her. 
---
he could make. 
---
he liked
---
he
 proceeding to
---
Have you met Jude and his young woman, or wife, or whatever she is?

---
that's his present young woman-- wife
---
Has he
 married again?"


---
He's a nice- looking chap, too! 
---
he's not
. 
---
The physician had produced a box from his waistcoat pocket, and

---
he when were paid for
---
you lost him, then? 
---
And believe me he soon
 knew nearly as much as I."

" I lost him
---
There he is,
---
So her husband thought, no doubt,... 
---
when he divorced
 her
---
the
 inscription was:" Model of Cardinal College, Christminster;
 by J. Fawley and S. F. M. Bridehead."


---
Jude's hand sought Sue's as they stood, the two standing close
 together so as to conceal, as they supposed, this tacit expression
 of their mutual responsiveness
---
Anny meanwhile had jokingly remarked to Vilbert on Arabella's
 hankering interest in her first husband.


---
He
 produced a small phial of clear liquid. 
---
You use the liquid by contriving that the desired man shall take
 about ten drops of it in his drink. 
---
him seated on
 a stool by the bar,
---
who had
 served him with spirits
---
other men
 do their wives
---
they left the tent together,
 this pot- bellied man and florid woman, in the antipathetic,
 recriminatory mood of the average husband and wife of Christendom.


---
he: and then playfully gave her a little push,

---
it was my
 husband's fault
---
he murmured.


---
Jude was quite content with a baffle from his ever evasive companion.

---
when he had forgotten
---
he had put the question, and
---
he no longer wished for an answer
---
they had taken him to
 everything likely to attract a young intelligence
---
He knew. 
---
he said. 
---
who called Jude" Father
---
he was formally turned into" Jude

Little Time-- for though stuck to him a great deal
 of pain and sadness.


---
that had been made to him by the
 other boys
---
when he heard them,
---
two or three months
 later Jude perceived
---
he would have
---
he had
---
he sat down. 
---
he said to her,
---
whatever you wo n't take him away from me, Jude dear? 
---
him go now
---
The cloud upon his young mind makes him so
 pathetic to me
---
he loves me so.

---
You wo n't take him away from me?"


---
" Do n't hurry about getting employment he said regretfully. 
---
The boy and
 yourself are enough for you to attend to."


---
Jude answered it. 
---
Is Mr. Fawley at home?
---
Jude reflected, and.


---
he could undertake it
---
he has refused."


---
" Excellent old man!" said Sue to herself,.


---
he wo n't have

Jude came indoors. "
---
, he said cheerfully. 
---
Jude went out to the church, which was only two miles
 off. 
---
He found.

---
he set about mending a portion of the
 second

where he might find her
 between school- hours,
---
he wished

He described
---
how some boys had taunted him about his nominal mother,
 and Sue,
---
the men had
---
There was no true religion
 in the country at that date, neither among pa'sons, clerks, nor
 people, and to keep the men up to their work
---
Jude and
 Sue had left the" nots" out likewise, and then severally left the
 church, even the old woman at last. 
---
, remained without
 speaking looking at her narrowly he found.


---
" Never mind, comrade!" he said. 
---
said Jude gaily. 
---
whether said Jude. 
---
when
 a man entered the church, and
---
Jude recognized in him the contractor
 Willis
---
He beckoned to Jude, and.


---
"-- he said, with rather
 breathless awkwardness. 
---
Jude was too independent to make any fuss; and
---
the contractor paid
 him, and. 
---
Jude picked up his tools, and
---
Jude returned. 
---
overtaking the boy pursued their thoughtful way
 to Aldbrickham
---
Fawley had still a pretty zeal in the cause of education, and,
---
as was
 natural with his experiences he was active in furthering" equality
 of opportunity" by any humble means open to him. 
---
He had joined an
 Artizans' Mutual Improvement Society established in the town about
 the time of his arrival there
---
its members being young men of all
 creeds and denominations, including Churchmen, Congregationalists,
 Baptists, Unitarians, Positivists, and others
---
subscription
 was small, and the room homely; and Jude's activity, uncustomary
 acquirements, and, above all, singular intuition on what to read
 and how to set about it-- begotten of his years of struggle against
 malignant stars
---
he had obtained any more work to do
---
he went. 
---
when he arrived
---
he entered
---
they looked dubiously at him,
 and
---
He guessed. 
---
something
 bearing on himself had been discussed or
---
Nothing further was said in Jude's presence, but
---
he knew what this
 meant; and.


---
could Jude do with his great- aunt's heavy old furniture,
---
he left
 the town
---
, what
 if to travel he knew not whither? 
---
This, and the necessity of
 ready money compelled him.


---
much he would
 have preferred
---
he had

---
the child's, and Jude's breakfast in the little house furnished. 
---
he was compelled
---
Here Jude discovered her; and with the child, and
---
Jude
 wrote" Private" on a scrap of paper
---
he sighed heavily. 
---
To cut him
 off from his past I have determined. 
---
he keeps a cake and gingerbread stall at markets and fairs,
."


---
Now
 this antique oak settle-- a unique example of old English furniture,
 worthy the attention of all collectors!"


---
said Jude. 
---
Jude
 and were getting tired and hungry, but
---
Noting her dissembled distress Jude kissed her, and. 
---
He would go on with the
 boy, and.


---
Jude did not come
 back. 
---
he does n't catch
 them
---
to pay the poulterer for them, if said Jude. 
---
Well, said Jude.

---
Jude Fawley and Sue walked no more in the town of
 Aldbrickham.


---
they had taken advantage of his adaptive craftsmanship
---
Wherever Jude heard of free- stone work to be done
---
he went
---
He laboured at a job,.


---
Sometimes he might have
 been found. 
---
Later still he was at
 Kennetbridge, a thriving town not more than a dozen miles south of
 Marygreen,
---
this being his nearest approach to the village where he
 was known
---
he had a sensitive dread of being questioned as to his
 life and fortunes by those who had been acquainted with him during
 his ardent young manhood of study and promise, and his brief and
 unhappy married life at that time.


---
he would be detained for months, at others
 only a few weeks. 
---
which had risen in him
---
His curious and sudden antipathy to ecclesiastical
 work, remained with him
 in cold blood,
---
him to seek a living
 out of those who would disapprove of his ways
---
he had first

---
less from any fear of renewed censure than from an
 ultra- conscientiousness; also, too, from a
 sense of inconsistency between his former dogmas and his present
 practice, hardly a shred of the beliefs with which gone up to Christminster. 
---
He was
---
when he first met
 her
---
" said the widow- lady to her
 companion, when the horse and cart had been taken by a man who came
 forward:"
---
Making inquiries within which
 and on
 the boards the
 foundation- stone of the chapel about to be erected would be laid that
 afternoon at three o'clock by a London preacher of great popularity
 among his body.


---
How do you do, Mrs.
 Fawley?
---
He died suddenly, six weeks ago,,. 
---
he was a kind husband to me
---
When he was gone
---
He'll never be a beauty
---
" will
 he, poor chap! 
---
Does he know"


---
I am his mother really?
---
He thinks.

---
there is some mystery about his parentage--
---
Jude is going."


---
when he is a little older
---
Then you are living with him still?"


---
Jude used."


---
Perhaps my husband has altered a little since then. 
---
I am sure he
 is not proud now!" 
---
he caught a chill early in the year
---
he had
---
He is better
 than he was; but
---
He was brought up to the baking business,
 and
---
it occurred to him. 
---
he can make
 without coming out of doors
---
It was a whim of his
 to do them in pastry."


---
he is,
---
he is
---
you are so fond of
 him
---
Of course Christminster is a sort of fixed vision with him, which
 I suppose he'll never be cured of believing in. 
---
He still thinks it
 a great centre of high and fearless thought,
---
his
 illness came
---
Here comes the boy back again
---
My boy and
 Jude's! darted a spark. 
---
He's in very good hands,; and
---
I've heard of Jude, and
---
I've seen his wife. 
---
You could take a lock of your late- lost husband's hair, and."


---
I had Jude
 back again
---
he's another's
---
He's more mine than hers!
---
she to
 him I should like
---
I'd take him from her!"


---
your husband gone! 
---
it leads to where he is,
---
he carried a basket; and
---
there was
 a touch of slovenliness in his attire, together with that indefinable
 something in his whole appearance which suggested one who was his
 own housekeeper, purveyor, confidant, and friend, through possessing
 nobody else at all in the world to act in those capacities for him.

---
they offered him a lift, which he accepted.


---
If I am talking to Mr. Phillotson?"


---
my name is
 Phillotson
---
Yes; he said. 
---
He shook his head. 
---
he said politely,".

---
Dear me said Phillotson, starting out of his stiffness.

---
To be sure he had a wife! 
---
he med have been right in doing it-- right for both
---
my husband died
 lately
---
said Phillotson, with sudden testiness. 
---
that would out unsealed him
---
he replied. 
---
he accepted my services. 
---
Her husband is ill, and she anxious. 
---
Phillotson grasped the edge of the spring- cart, and. "
---
-- to
 go he said.


---
he med be of her
---
he says
---
Then shall the man be
 guiltless; but.' 
---
said Phillotson, with biting sadness. 
---
approached a mill, Phillotson said
---
his
 errand led him
---
he alighted,.


---
When all her" Christminster" cakes had been disposed of she took
 upon her arm the empty basket, and the cloth which had covered the
 standing she had hired, and giving the other things to the boy left
 the street with him. 
---
How is he now
---
Before again your husband will be well enough-- don't' ee trouble."


---
Here
 they greeted Jude, who was sitting in an arm- chair, the increased
 delicacy of his normally delicate features, and the childishly
 expectant look in his eyes, being alone sufficient to show that he
 had been passing through a severe illness.


---
What-- he said, a gleam of interest lighting
 up his face.


---
Jude was
---
What-- he said.


---
Jude's countenance remained clouded. 
---
said Jude,. 
---
Then Jude confessed. 
---
what was in his mind
---
He said. 
---
his having resolutely avoided all the old places
 for so long
---
him think a great
 deal of Christminster lately
---
if he would like
. 
---
he could n't work
---
He had no sense
 of shame at mere poverty; and
---
perhaps he would be as strong as ever
 soon, and able to set up stone- cutting for himself there.

"
---
how it hates all men like me
---
he was recovering
---
His hope that proved so far well grounded had arrived in the city of many memories.






---
the station was lively with straw- hatted young men,
 welcoming young girls who bore a remarkable family likeness to their
 welcomers, and who were dressed up in the brightest and lightest of
 raiment.


---
said Jude quietly, as he took charge of the small child, and
 told Arabella's boy to keep close to them, Sue attending to their own
 eldest. 
---
Having left their luggage and his tools at the station they proceeded
 on foot up the familiar street. 
---
when looking at
 the clock and Jude said:"
---
his soul seemed full of the anniversary, and
---
together they went
 down Chief Street, their smallest child in Jude's arms, Sue leading
 her little girl, and Arabella's boy walking thoughtfully and silently
 beside them. 
---
said Jude. 
---
he was getting into one of his
 tempestuous, self- harrowing moods
---
"; said he.


---
till there arose on Jude's sight
---
which stood in his mind as the sad
 symbol of his abandoned hopes,
---
he
 had finally surveyed the City of Colleges on the afternoon of his
 great meditation,
---
which convinced him at last of the futility of his
 attempt to be a son of the university
---
pushing his way to the front he took up a
 position close to the barrier,,.

---
he
 whispered.


---
said Jude, without turning his head.


---
he wondered
---
Jude,, explained it, and
---
the people all round him
---
he had studied years
 before
---
The idle crowd, including the two policemen at the doors, stared like
 the Lycaonians at Paul, for Jude
---
I know that man
---
Why, he used
-- Jude Fawley, that's his name
---
he used
---
d'ye mind?--because he
 aimed at that line o' business? 
---
He's married. 
---
that's his child
---
he's carrying
---
Taylor would know him,."


---
he knows
 everybody
---
The speaker was a man named Jack Stagg, with whom Jude had formerly

---
Having his attention called the latter cried
 across the barriers to Jude
---
Jude nodded.


---
Jude assented to this also.

"
---
Jude recognized its owner.


---
he had

---
Jude replied good- humouredly.

"
---
he could not dispute it; and
---
Tinker Taylor asked Jude and the night of
 the challenge in the public house
---
he remembered the Apostles' Creed in Latin still,
---
he stood submerged and invisible in the crowd
---
finding himself the centre of curiosity, quizzing, and comment Jude was not inclined; and
---
he
 had no great reason to be ashamed of
---
But,
 to shrink from open declarations of what in a little while was
 stimulated to say in a loud voice to the listening throng generally It is a difficult question, my friends, for any young man-- that
 question I had to grapple with, and which thousands are weighing
 at the present moment in these uprising times-- whether to follow
 uncritically the track he finds himself in, without considering his
 aptness for it, or to consider what his aptness or bent may be, and
 re- shape his course accordingly. 
---
how
 wise that young man was,
---
a fool was in following a freak of his fancy
---
my impulses-- affections-- vices-- were too strong not to hamper a man without advantages
---
He do look ill and!
---
before-- be a sort of success as a
 frightful example of what not to do; and so illustrate a moral
 story continued Jude,,. 
---
he had

---
Jude shifted the child into a more easy position on his arm, and
. 
---
what can only be discovered
 by men or women with greater insight than mine--
---
what is good for
 man in this life?--and
---
who can tell a man?'"


---
what shall be after him
 under the sun
---
privately to his
 neighbours", jobbing pa'sons that takes the services.

---
then he must have
!"


---
a sort of objective commentary on Jude's remarks there drove up
 at this moment with a belated Doctor, robed and panting, a cab
---
If said Jude," at college gates in the most
 religious and educational city in the world,?"


---
Jude was not
 one of these, and
---
Jude did not notice it then
---
said he.


---
the procession of heads of houses and new Doctors
 emerged, their red and black gowned forms passing across the field of
 Jude's vision like inaccessible planets across an object- glass.


---
though he seemed, and. 
---
Here
 they stood upon the straw that was laid to drown the discordant noise
 of wheels, where the quaint and frost- eaten stone busts encircling
 the building looked with pallid grimness on the proceedings, and in
 particular at the bedraggled Jude, Sue, and their children, as at
 ludicrous persons who had no business there.


---
he said to her fervidly. 
---
However the shouts and hurrahs
 between each piece of oratory, Jude's standing in the wet did not
 bring much Latin to his intelligence more than, now and then
---
, beyond the peals of the organ, and he sighed after a
 while. 
---
I saw Richard amongst the people on the other side."


---
He is evidently come up to Jerusalem: and. 
---
He had the same hankering for the university that you had, in
 a milder form. 
---
he saw me,
---
he must have heard

---
he seemed."


---
he did
---
Your mind is free from worries about him now,
 my Sue?"


---
Although I felt a curious dread of him; an awe, or terror, of
 conventions I do n't believe in. 
---
which to Jude was
 irresistible
---
" Ah-- listen! said Jude suddenly, instead of addressing her.


---
Jude coming to himself
---
Jude looked discomfited, and the boy distressed. "
---
here the occupier, observing
 not only Sue, but the boy and the small children
---
The boy sighed. 
---
he said. 
---
No colleges said Jude;"."


---
said Jude.


---
her husband could go
 elsewhere
---
Jude had time to get a more
 permanent abode
---
Jude
 stayed and; and. 
---
he
 went
---
When he was gone
---
her husband
 and herself had
---
Her quiet was broken by
 the noise of someone entering the house, and then the voices of a
 man and woman in conversation in the passage below. 
---
The landlady's
 husband had arrived, and
---
His voice rose in sudden anger. " Now who wants such a woman here?

---
when I said a single man
---
as the husband insisted on
 his point
---
which had just been sent
 on from the station by Jude
---
he was perhaps worried
 in obtaining a lodging for himself
---
said the boy with misgiving.


---
Jude had left his address; but
---
how weak he still was

---
it should have led Jude, who loved her and the children so tenderly,
,
---
he was
---
because still
 haunted by his dream
---
Even now he did not distinctly hear the
 freezing negative that those scholared walls had echoed to his
 desire.


---
The failure to find another lodging, and the lack of room in this
 house for his father had made
---
, a deep impression on the boy-- a
 brooding undemonstrative horror seemed. 
---
The
 silence was broken by his saying:"!"


---
I am afraid this will
 trouble your father."


---
Father was quite well
---
there had been room for him!

---
Father went away
---
did n't he?"


---
The boy jumped up wildly. 
---
The boy burst out weeping. 
---
he
 cried in bitter reproach. 
---
He walked up and down sobbing.

"
---
her bosom heaving
 now as much as the boy's
---
He got up, and. 
---
him say:"
---
Jude had
 informed
---
he went out
---
He had been so anxious about her all night
---
he
 said. 
---
Jude agreed with her.


---
he said. 
---
Jude stood,. 
---
his back was turned to the little inner
 chamber where the children lay
---
him to start round
---
He saw.

---
Hastening forward to pick her up he turned his eyes to the little
 bed
---
He looked in
 bewilderment round the room. 
---
these the forms of the two
 youngest children were suspended, by a piece of box- cord round each
 of their necks, while from a nail a few yards off the body of little
 Jude. 
---
An overturned chair was near
 the elder boy, and
---
his glazed eyes were slanted into the room; but

---
- he
 let and; but
---
He caught up Sue, who
 was in fainting fits, and
---
he breathlessly summoned the landlady and.


---
When he got back
---
Jude had
 inferred
---
as his presence was superfluous. 
---
the elder boy looked into
 the outer room for Sue, and,
---
the events and information of the
 evening had induced in his morbid temperament
---
he carried
---
her discourse with the boy had been the main cause of the
 tragedy
---
said Jude. 
---
It was in his nature. 
---
there are such boys springing up amongst us-- boys of a sort unknown
 in the last generation-- the outcome of new views of life
---
He says. 
---
He's an advanced man, the Doctor: but

---
he can give no consolation; but
---
to-- Jude had kept back his own grief on account of her
---
he now
 broke down; and. 
---
The boy's face expressed the whole tale of their situation. 
---
that little shape had converged all the inauspiciousness and shadow
 which had darkened the first union of Jude, and all the accidents,
 mistakes, fears, errors of the last. 
---
He was their nodal point, their
 focus, their expression in a single term. 
---
he had groaned,
---
he had quaked, and
 for the misfortunes of these he had died.


---
We are made a
 spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men!'"


---
Jude listened--"No-- he said. 
---
He tried."


---
which had been lying on a chair at the time
 of his death
---
Jude would fain

---
whenever he touched them
---
Jude dreaded her dull apathetic silences almost more than her
 paroxysms. 
---
he said,
---
who incited him really,
---
he took it literally.

---
I told him. 
---
It upset him. 
---
how bitterly he upbraided me!"


---
I told him? 
---
He must have
 known sooner or later."


---
now I shall
 never see him in it, and
---
the boy wished, or
---
he
 would n't have done it
---
him to die
---
for it
 was part of his incurably sad nature, poor little fellow! 
---
he replied. 
---
Jude got into the vehicle, and
---
it drove away, much to the
 relief of the landlord, who now had only Sue and her luggage
 remaining on his hands, which he hoped to be also clear of later on
 in the day, and. 
---
it had acquired during the week through his wife's unlucky
 admission of these strangers
---
he privately
 consulted with the owner of the house, and
---
When Jude had seen the two little boxes-- one containing little Jude,
 and the other the two smallest-- deposited in the earth he hastened
 back to Sue, who was still in her room, and
---
he therefore did not
 disturb her just then. 
---
Feeling anxious however he went again
 about four o'clock. 
---
Jude
 hurried off to the public house where he was sleeping. 
---
he went along
 the road to the cemetery, which he entered
---
A man with a
 shovel in his hands was attempting to earth in the common grave of
 the three children, but
---
his arm was held back by an expostulating
 woman who stood in the half- filled hole. 
---
He's filling them in, and
---
he sha n't!
---
let said the man with the spade. 
---
Do ye go home with
 your husband, and."


---
Jude was thrown into such acute sorrow. 
---
he
 almost felt
---
he would try
---
the man to accede
---
he saw. 
---
So he coaxed her, and

---
He wished, but and
---
economy being so
 imperative she deprecated his doing so,
---
Jude saw in course of time. 
---
Jude waited all the evening downstairs. 
---
the
 intelligence was brought to him and.




---
Jude had

---
those ideas were now exchanged for a sense of
 Jude and
---
All the ancient wrath of
 the Power above us has been vented upon us, His poor creatures, and
. 
---
It is only against man and senseless circumstance
---
said Jude.


---
We are made a
 spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men!' 
---
Jude fell into thought. 
---
" he said,". 
---
Yet I am one of those men! 
---
perhaps you would n't have urged him."


---
Jude looked at her with some surprise, and.

"
---
I am still his wife
---
Jude had
---
almost directly
 he arrived,; and

---
the summer weather suiting his fragile constitution
---
outwardly his days went on with that monotonous uniformity which
 is in itself so grateful after vicissitude
---
he had ever shown any awkward aberrancies
---
he
 daily mounted to the parapets and copings of colleges.


---
he could never
 enter, and
---
he
 would never look from,
---
he had known no wish to do otherwise
---
There was this change in him
---
he did not often go to any service
 at the churches now. 
---
One thing troubled him more than any other;
,. 
---
he came in rather late. 
---
when he found her silent and
 meditative
---
What he asked curiously.


---
he murmured. 
---
he said,. 
---
Not knowing the whole of her meaning he took the objection serenely,
 and. 
---
he thought; but. 
---
he spoke softly, and
---
he said. 
---
I am Richard's.
---
; I belong to him, or to nobody."


---
Is Mr. Fawley here?"


---
Jude and Sue started
---
he mechanically replied in
---
He formally requested her, and no characteristic that enabled them to estimate her general
 aspect and air. 
---
Jude had felt
---
it to be his duty
---
" said Jude drearily.


---
He was my child, and
---
naturally I feel for him."


---
I am not his wife
---
Jude had known from the quality of Sue's tone; but
---
boy had shown no care at all
---
" said Jude shortly.


---
Father is come home again, and
---
I am living
 with him."


---
He has returned from Australia?
---
said Jude with languid curiosity.


---
Father and have just got back
---
He has got a cottage near the
 old place, and
---
I am keeping house for him."


---
Jude was, and. 
---
The carpenter called his
 wife,.

" Surely not at this time o' night?
---
said Jude. 
---
Jude went vaguely in the direction of the church, which he had never
 once approached since he lived out that way years before, when his
 young opinions were more mystical than they were now. 
---
deserted he lifted the latch
 without noise, and,. 
---
The floor- cloth deadened his footsteps.


---
he
 moved in that direction through the obscurity, which was broken only
 by the faintest reflected night- light from without
---
he had heard before
---
It was
 his Sue's form, prostrate on the paving.


---
he retorted in quick reproach, for his full heart

---
Richard to be my husband!"


---
said Jude, verging on tears. 
---
He returned vehemently:! 
---
He put his arm
 and; but
---
I belong to
 him
---
I sacramentally joined myself to him for life. 
---
surely we are man and wife,? 
---
you are like a totally deaf man
 observing people listening to music
---
said
 Jude
---
he was in the open street
---
He flung and. 
---
Jude said with suppressed
 tears,"?"


---
He went and. 
---
Jude had followed her, and
---
men ca n't, because they-- won't.
---
Your wickedness was only the natural man's desire
 to possess the woman. 
---
he burst out
---
regardless of the injury it may do the man
---
The further the more harm!"

" O Sue said he with a sudden sense of his own danger. "! 
---
you became my guardian- angel
---
if it will be with me another case of the
 pig that was washed turning back to his wallowing in the mire!"


---
Well-- never mind; do n't grieve said Jude generously. 
---
Perhaps perhaps I spoilt one of the highest and
 purest loves that ever existed between man and woman!... 
---
He went to the bed,.


---
he said, and.


---
He clasped her, and
---
he had scarcely ever
 done before
---
Jude did not permit himself, but.




---
The man whom Sue, in her mental_ volte- face_, was now regarding as
 her inseparable husband lived still at Marygreen.


---
Phillotson had seen
 both her and Jude. 
---
he had said nothing of it at the
 moment to his companion Gillingham,.


---
said Phillotson gruffly. 
---
he added," Susanna."


---
when Gillingham had gone back to his school
 near Shaston, Phillotson
---
he walked down
 the long hill which he had known before Jude knew it, though his
 history had not beaten so intensely upon its incline
---
he bought his usual weekly local paper; and
---
when he had sat
 down in an inn
---
Arrived in
 the town to refresh himself for the five miles' walk back pulled the paper from his pocket and. 
---
The account of the
" strange suicide of a stone- mason's children met his eye.


---
he was
---
Unimpassioned as impressed him painfully, and. 
---
he could not understand the age of the elder child
 being what it was stated to be
---
he said: and thought and thought
 of Sue, and what she had gained by leaving him.


---
Jude
 had seen no more of her
---
Phillotson was on his way homeward, and.


---
when he
 encountered Arabella
---
You like walking out this way, Mrs. Cartlett he said.


---
I've seen Jude."


---
He's not her husband, after all. 
---
they have passed as man and wife so long
---
the eldest boy was mine--"

" Oh-- yours!"


---
Father to look after now
---
When Phillotson had ascended the hill
---
he
 stopped
---
Meanwhile Phillotson ascended to Marygreen, and for the first time
 during a lengthened period he lived with a forward eye. 
---
he had been reduced
---
On crossing
 under the large trees of the green to the humble schoolhouse to which
 he stood a moment, and. 
---
No man had ever suffered more inconvenience
 from his own charity, Christian or heathen,. 
---
Phillotson had done
 in letting Sue go
---
He had been knocked about from pillar to post at
 the hands of the virtuous almost beyond endurance
---
he had been nearly
 starved, and.
---
where the parson had got for befriending him
---
He had often thought of Arabella's remarks
,. 
---
he should have been more severe with Sue
---
such was his obstinate and
 illogical disregard of opinion, and.


---
he had
 been trained,
---
his convictions on the rightness of his course
 with his wife had not been disturbed
---
him to give Sue her liberty
---
The instincts now enabled him. 
---
He wished for her still,
 in his curious way,.


---
he did not love her, and
---
he would be gratified
---
his always
 provided
---
he had found, for stemming the cold and
 inhumane blast of the world's contempt. 
---
By getting Sue back and remarrying her on the
 respectable plea of having entertained erroneous views of her, and
 gained his divorce wrongfully he might acquire some comfort,.


---
He thought.

---
he would write to Gillingham, and

---
he thought of his, Phillotson's,
---
Probably, as his attachment to her seemed
 unusually strong the singular pair would make their union legal in
 course of time, and
---
He wrote a brief reply to Gillingham. 
---
he had made up his mind
---
he had written to his
 friend
---
However it was Phillotson's way to act thus.


---
He accordingly addressed a carefully considered epistle to Sue, and,

---
He stated. 
---
it having come to his
 knowledge
---
he felt
---
his own too were largely modified by events subsequent
 to their parting
---
He would not conceal from her. 
---
passionate
 love had little to do with his communication
---
It arose from a wish
 if not a success, at least no such disastrous
 failure as they threatened to become, through his acting on what
 he had considered at the time a principle of justice, charity, and
 reason.


---
he had found,. 
---
He suggested.


---
he took out the last paragraph but one; and
---
he dispatched it immediately, and.




---
a figure moved through the white fog which enveloped
 the Beersheba suburb of Christminster, towards the quarter in which
 Jude Fawley had taken up his lodging since his division from Sue. 
---
A
 timid knock sounded upon the door of his abode.


---
so he was at home; and
---
he
 jumped up and.

"
---
Jude put on his hat. 
---
for he said.

---
Jude was
---
I am going back to
 Richard. 
---
He has-- so magnanimously agreed."


---
He is going. 
---
of
 course I AM his wife already. 
---
He turned upon her with an anguish that was well- nigh fierce.


---
I would go back to Richard without repeating the sacrament,. 
---
he asked me
---
Jude return good for evil! 
---
He shook his head hopelessly, his eyes wet. 
---
" All wrong, all wrong! he said huskily.

---
Do you care for
 him? 
---
Do you love him? 
---
I do n't love him--
---
Jude argued, but
---
I
 have even owned the extreme fact that I do not love him. 
---
he coming? 
---
He wo n't condescend?"


---
I wo n't let him. 
---
I go to him voluntarily,. 
---
just I went away
 from him
---
Every successful man is more or less a
 selfish man. 
---
Jude had no heart. 
---
could he go
 anywhere in the direction by which she would be likely to pass.

---
He went in an opposite one, to a dreary, strange, flat scene, where
 boughs dripped, and coughs and consumption lurked, and.

"
---
where he had

---
he murmured miserably.


---
It had been her request to Phillotson that he should not meet
 her. 
---
he had found the master's
 house open
---
The man informed her.


---
he had, and
---
Phillotson stood in the middle of the room,,
.


---
He was so stirred by her pitiful words and tone. 
---
he did
---
he had meant
---
He bent and.


---
her flesh quivering under the touch of
 his lips
---
Phillotson's heart sank, for desire. 
---
him know
---
I have told
 him all, and
---
he highly approves
---
he says. 
---
He's been good enough
 to come all the way from Shaston at great inconvenience to himself."


---
Her look
 was that of the condemned criminal who catches sight of his coffin.


---
What said Phillotson.


---
said Phillotson. 
---
Gillingham now joined them from his room above, and
---
that interested him
 most of all
---
Phillotson crossed the green with her,
.


---
" what-- not to marry this man again said
 Mrs. Edlin indignantly. 
---
I I am his already!"


---
You be t' other man's. 
---
Richard says! 
---
he'll have me back, and
---
he had

---
Phillotson in the interval had gone back to his friend Gillingham,
. 
---
he said,"
---
Phillotson was more evasive to- night. 
---
He did not care. 
---
his taking Sue to him again
---
He said,
". 
---
Gillingham looked at him, and
---
induced by the world's sneers and his own
 physical wishes
---
" to give way to impulse Phillotson resumed,
. 
---
Phillotson did not say so
---
Phillotson said" Good- night."


---
Oh, is Mr. Phillotson said Mrs. Edlin. 
---
said Phillotson with grave
 reserve,. 
---
he loves her dearly; and
---
The one man wo n't allow. 
---
Phillotson spoke stiffly. 
---
Phillotson nodded, and"
---
how staunch his friend was
---
The
 fact of her having lived with Fawley
---
the self- sacrifice of the woman on the
 altar of what was acquiesced
 in by these two friends, each from his own point of view. 
---
Phillotson
 went across to. 
---
he checked his impulse,.


---
which unpleasantly lingered in his mind
---
he said pleasantly:"."


---
he felt.


---
he was
---
which had induced him
---
the vicar congratulated the husband
 and wife on having performed a noble, and righteous, and mutually
 forgiving act. 
---
well he said.

---
He too congratulated the couple. 
---
he said in parting
 from Phillotson, who walked out a little way,
---
compunction wrought on him at sight of it.


---
", my dear, to intrude upon your personal
 privacy any more than he said gravely. 
---
VI


 was the door of Jude's lodging in the out- skirts of
 Christminster-- far from the precincts of St. Silas' where he had
. 
---
which saddened him
---
who held the door in his hand
---
Father has
 turned me out of doors after borrowing every penny. 
---
where there's so
 many young men
---
the evening being
 that of the day after Sue's remarriage with Phillotson
---
said Jude coldly.


---
said Jude hastily. 
---
said Jude. 
---
Unable to be harsh with her, and not knowing what to do Jude called
 the man who let the lodgings, and.


---
this was an acquaintance of
 his in great distress for want of temporary shelter
---
My father has insulted me this afternoon, and
---
I've
 left him, though without a penny!"


---
he could not recall her features
---
you are a friend of Mr. Fawley's we'll do what we can for a day
 or two
---
still if he'll make himself answerable?"


---
said Jude. 
---
If he'll have a chance of getting back to his old
 position, by everybody's account
---
All his will be pleased,."


---
which informed him
---
When Jude suggested London as
 affording the most likely opening in the liquor trade
---
when he breakfasted later than on
 other days
---
if he said indifferently.


---
Jude could not bear; but
---
his suspense
 pitted itself against his discretion, and. 
---
" if he said. 
---
" Oh-- he said impatiently. 
---
thus
 his suspense as to Sue's welfare, and the possible marriage, moved
 him.


---
he would have
 thought of choosing deliberately
---
Jude requesting her
---
he said:! 
---
having finished work he could not help
---
He merely said" Well?" with the very
 reverse of a smile.


---
" Yes-- of course he returned. 
---
he was her
 only husband, and
---
he lived
---
He closed that issue by remarking abruptly:" Well-- now I know all I
 wanted to know. 
---
he left her straightway.


---
Jude walked to well- nigh every spot
 in the city that he had visited with Sue
---
he did not know
 whither, and.

---
having all the vices of his virtues, and he turned
 into a public house, for the first time during many months. 
---
Jude
 did not return. 
---
where her father
 lived
---
He's on the
 loose
---
I must get him home. 
---
he had not returned
---
A
 shrewd guess as to his probable course took her straight to the
 tavern which Jude had formerly frequented, and. 
---
He was drinking nothing stronger than ale just then.

---
He did not observe her, and
---
Jude looked up, and?... 
---
he was a little way on
 in liquor, but only a little as yet
---
that's better fit
 for a man of education than beer. 
---
Jude had the pleasure of being,. 
---
where he drank
---
Her tone towards him to- night was uniformly soothing and cajoling;
 and
---
whenever he said"
---
he
 did
---
he'll have
---
Come round to my father's I made it up
 with him a bit to- day. 
---
Anything-- anywhere replied Jude. 
---
her arm
 still round his waist, and his, at last, round hers; though with no
 amatory intent; but
---
merely he was weary, unstable, and
---
he stammered. 
---
I am reminded of it-- by our passing by here-- old Fuller
 in his_ Holy State_
---
They had reached her father's house, and
---
Jude did not think of that,.


---
" said Jude.


---
He'd make a row, perhaps."


---
endeavouring to look like a master pork- butcher his waist dangled
---
he said casually. 
---
It's Jude. 
---
He's come back to me."


---
I always did like him
---
how does he come?
---
he and I are
---
it is the rummest thing I ever heard of-- marrying an
 old husband again, and so much new blood in the world! 
---
He's no
 catch, to my thinking. 
---
It is n't rum for a woman to want her old husband back for
 respectability, though for a man to want his old wife back-- well,
 perhaps it is funny, rather!" 
---
her father joined more moderately
---
He told me this morning
---
his head ached
 fit, and
---
he hardly seemed. 
---
where he was
---
how he mixed his drink last night
---
We must keep
 him jolly and cheerful here for a day or two, and. 
---
him go back
 to his lodging
---
how he is now, poor deary
---
The fevered
 flush on his face from the debauch of the previous evening lessened
 the fragility of his ordinary appearance, and
---
his long lashes,
 dark brows, and curly back completed the physiognomy of one whom Arabella, as a woman of rank
 passions, still felt it worth while to recapture, highly important
 to recapture as a woman straitened both in means and in reputation.

---
to affect him his quick breathing became
, and
---
he opened his eyes.

"
---
he could not bear
 the daylight in his throbbing eye- balls
---
Quite indifferent, and shutting his eyes because Jude seemed.

---
Jude was in such physical pain from his unfortunate break- down of
 the previous night, and in such mental pain from the loss of Sue and
 from having yielded in his half- somnolent state to Arabella,
---
when he saw
---
his few chattels unpacked and,
---
he scarcely
 considered, or.


---
I know his
 nature, and
---
he once gets into that fearfully low state
---
if he
 does get into
---
that sometimes he'll never do the honourable thing by me
 in this world, and
---
He must be kept
 cheerful. 
---
He has a little money in the savings bank, and
---
he has
 given me his purse. 
---
he's in the humour. 
---
Three days later when Jude had recovered somewhat from the fearful
 throbbing of his eyes and brain, but
---
what had been supplied to him by Arabella during
 the interval
---
the quiet
 convivial gathering,, to wind Jude up to the
 striking point, took place.


---
Jude was asked. 
---
he could suggest any guest
 in addition to those named by Arabella and her father, and in a
 saturnine humour of perfect recklessness mentioned Uncle Joe, and
 Stagg, and the decayed auctioneer, and others whom he remembered as
 having been frequenters of the well- known tavern during his bout
 therein years before
---
He also suggested Freckles and Bower o' Bliss.

---
he lived in the same
 street,
---
Another man Tinker Taylor, though was not invited; but
---
he went homeward from a late job on
 the evening of the party
---
he had occasion. 
---
he was promised some the next
 morning. 
---
While making his inquiry glanced into the back room,
 and. 
---
He went home to
 bed, and
---
He thought it hardly worth while to call at the shop for his
 provisions at that hour, Donn and his daughter being probably not up,
. 
---
However he found in passing
 that the door was open, and. 
---
he could hear voices within,
---
He went and.

"
---
he said,.


---
precisely he had left them eleven hours earlier
---
" he said. 
---
He now perceived
---
that her arm being
 round his waist. 
---
Jude bore on his
 face the signs of how deeply he had been indulging.


---
" Jude and I
 have decided. 
---
Jude seemed. 
---
I told him last night. 
---
He highly
 approved."


---
Oh very well, said her father,.


---
asked he,.


---
who did not know him
---
said Jude doggedly. 
---
Now Mr. Fawley be honourable said Donn. 
---
I know no more than a dead man
---
I am not a man who wants to save
 himself at the expense of the weaker among us!"


---
There never mind him, deary
---
Jude went upstairs with her, and. 
---
to speak against friends he said. 
---
he'll do it
---
He's been put upon his honour by the woman
---
he med.
---
He'd hardly do it straight off like this. 
---
He's got no licence nor
 anything."


---
said Tinker Taylor, relighting his pipe at the gas- jet.

---
Tinker Taylor was
 the chief of these, and after a time he came in with a leer on his
 face.


---
Take my word he turned
 rusty at the last minute. 
---
Mrs. Fawley again replied Arabella blandly,. 
---
he was a very nice, gentlemanly man indeed. 
---
He said to me as gentle as a babe when all was done:
'
---
he says. 
---
his I think
---
says he. 
---
he was a very
 nice, gentlemanly man. '
---
strictly speaking he says:' and:.' 
---
no man put asunder
---
he was a very nice,
 gentlemanly man... 
---
" said Jude stolidly.


---
Jude and his wife, were in
 lodgings on the top floor of a dwelling nearer to the centre of the
 city.


---
He had done a few days' work during the two or three months since
 the event, but
---
his health had been indifferent, and
---
He was sitting in an arm- chair before the fire, and
.


---
he laughing acridly
---
especially
 he had seen
---
he was about to give them notice to quit, till by
 chance
---
he recognized the note of
 genuine wedlock; and
---
Jude did not get any better, and
---
he requested Arabella, with
 considerable hesitation,. 
---
I wish and with her husband. 
---
he pleaded. 
---
He felt.


---
his physical weakness had
 taken away all his dignity
---
Almost as soon as Jude sprang from the chair,
 and
---
he had her on her back upon a
 little couch which stood there
---
before he kneeling above her.

"
---
he whispered," and
---
he said scornfully. 
---
he loosened her
---
He then began, and
---
he sank back ghastly pale
---
The softer side of his nature made him unable
 to resist the offer even now, and
---
he had been
---
he replied
 breathlessly:". 
---
he inquired.


---
Jude wondered, but
---
foolish Hope,, made him
 restless with expectation. 
---
He knew the times of the possible trains,
 and.


---
Jude would not address Arabella again thereon.

---
He hoped and; but
---
Then Jude decided in the privacy of his
 mind. 
---
His physical
 weakness was such that he she d tears at the disappointment when she
 was not there to see. 
---
His suspicions were, in fact.

---
He never said another word to her about his wish or his conjecture.

---
A silent, undiscerned resolve grew up in him,. 
---
which gave him, if not
 strength, stability and calm
---
my man gone to
---
any sick man
 would have ventured out to almost certain death
---
he had gone out, and
---
he's such a fool
---
him be
---
Jude was at that moment in a railway train that was drawing near to
 Alfredston,. 
---
he had come with
---
that alone
 sustained him,
---
he was quite blown, but
---
he pressed on; and
---
Jude crossed the green to the
 church without observation, and. 
---
Here he
 stood,.


---
he could hear the usual
 sing- song tones of the little voices that had not learnt Creation's
 groan
---
He waited. 
---
a small boy came from the school--
---
Jude held up his
 hand, and
---
Jude heard. 
---
him knock at the door of the
 dwelling
---
He himself went further into the church. 
---
He stood by these:

---
they seemed akin to the perished people of that place who were his
 ancestors and Sue's.


---
he looked
 round.


---
He advanced, but

---
he implored. 
---
him to come closer
---
you call yourself Phillotson's wife!

---
He is a kind husband to me-- And
---
you are
 not worth a man's love!"


---
her eye resting on him a moment
---
his,
 continued I must tell you-- oh I must-- my darling Love! 
---
He
 suggested it at the very first!"


---
I came back to him
---
Sue he said. 
---
Pressing her to him in his arms he bruised her
 lips with kisses.
---
Jude did.

---
He did not turn his head, but. 
---
he passed the end of the church
---
his coughs mingling with the rain on the windows
---
He was by this time at the corner of the green,
---
from which he had scared rooks as a boy. 
---
He
 turned and; and.


---
his eyes would light on that
 scene
---
Here
 in the teeth of the north- east wind and rain Jude now pursued his
 way, wet through, the necessary slowness of his walk from lack of his
 former strength being insufficent. 
---
He came to
 the milestone, and,. 
---
he went and. 
---
He passed the spot where the gibbet of his
 ancestor and Sue's had stood, and.


---
when he reached Alfredston, where he had a cup of tea,
 the deadly chill
---
him to endure fasting
---
To get home he had. 
---
He did not reach Christminster till ten o'clock.




---
said Jude,.


---
The water ran out of him, and
---
he went
---
he was compelled.


---
You've done for yourself by this, young man
---
a man confined to his room by
 inflammation of the lungs,
---
Jude kept.


---
The expression of Jude's corpselike face in the watery lamplight was
 indeed. 
---
he saw people
---
he
 stood still by an archway, like one watching a figure. 
---
walk out then
 he would look at a window like one discerning a familiar face behind
 it
---
He seemed.


---
he repeated
---
he said; and as he paused,
---
"," holding to the
 railings he measured with his eye the height of a college front.

---
As I am neither a dweller among men nor
 ghosts. 
---
You are tough enough yet, old
 man."




---
Jude and Arabella were

---
He'll get a better school,."


---
He never is. 
---
He's gone to bed early."


---
I will tell you this-- Jude has been here this
 afternoon, and I find I still love him--
---
I have not told my husband of his visit
---
he agrees to it being otherwise
---
he agrees to my living; but
---
it is an
 indulgence I ought not to exact from him
---
I must be more
 just to him. 
---
you do n't like in him
---
Did you ever tell Jude?"

" Never."


---
I've screwed my weak soul up to treating him more
 courteously-- and
---
A man could be heard. 
---
he did not reply.

---
I don't hear him! 
---
Perhaps he's dead!"
---
I
 could go to Jude!... 
---
he's snoring again. 
---
Richard! said again.

"
---
He pulled
 on some articles of clothing, and. 
---
I met Jude! 
---
he was coming
---
I kissed him, and."


---
him kiss me
---
I called him my darling Love."

---
He spoke of some things of the past, and
---
He spoke of-- the children. 
---
There was something in Phillotson's tone now which seemed to
 show that his three months of remarriage with Sue had somehow not
 been so satisfactory as his magnanimity or amative patience had
 anticipated.


---
He went back to the room and.

---
He gloomily considered her thin and fragile
 form a moment longer.

---
" Well, he said presently. 
---
He put. 
---
he asked,.

---
Placing the candlestick on the chest of drawers he led her through
 the doorway, and,. 
---
Fifty- five
 years ago come Fall, since my man and
---
however he broke down again.


---
he had earned
---
With the money he shifted his lodgings to a yet more
 central part of the town. 
---
he was not likely
 to do much work for a long while, and
---
affairs had taken since her remarriage to him
---
Jude was absolutely indifferent to what she said, and
---
Sometimes his mood was more
 earnest, and
---
he lay
---
as he often rambled on upon the defeat of his
 early aims.


---
Every man has some little power in some one direction
---
he would
 say. 
---
while soliloquizing thus he called her" Sue"
 unconsciously.


---
he did not catch the word.


---
he received a surprise. 
---
where his
 affections were centred
---
He
 impulsively asked and. "
---
they are still only husband and
 wife in name?
---
he asked quickly.


---
He did n't wish it, but
---
which enlarge the views of most men
---
Jude reflected more and more on her news, and
---
As grew more restless he began in his mental agony. 
---
he got, and. 
---
there must excuse a man in suffering for what he
 says, and
---
God will forgive him
---
Jude had hitherto taken the medicines of
 that skilful practitioner with the greatest indifference
---
whenever
 poured down his throat by Arabella
---
he was
---
he vented his opinion of Vilbert in the physician's face,

---
he met Arabella,
---
how he thought
---
her husband was
 now,
---
He assented.


---
he drank.


---
he asked,.


---
Putting his arm round her shoulders he kissed her
 there and then.


---
My man will
 hear."


---
if I suppose he will soon-- it's well
 to keep chances open. 
---
His face was now so thin that his old friends would hardly have known
 him. 
---
her eyes round upon Jude
---
He seemed,.


---
his position was an elevated one, his malady
 preventing him lying down
---
Why ever
 does n't Father come
---
Still he slept, and. 
---
They reached so far as to the room in which
 Jude lay; and
---
his cough began again and

---
he could speak
---
As soon as he murmured,
---
his eyes still closed:" A
 little water, please."


---
Nothing but the deserted room received his appeal, and
---
he coughed
 to exhaustion again--!"


---
Presently he gasped again:
" Throat-- water-- Sue-- darling-- drop of water-- please--
---
he remained,
---
