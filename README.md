My MA dissertation at King's College London focuses on performing rhetorical and semantic analysis against Thomas Hardy's works with the intention of analyzing how Hardy develops characterization along gendered lines.

<a href="http://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/english/research/docuscope.html">Carnegie Mellon's DocuScope suite</a> performs the rhetorical analysis, but it requires rather targeted text files to function beyond text-wide sentiment analyses. As such, the scripts in this project will make use of Python's <a href="http://www.nltk.org/">Natural Language Toolkit</a> to help tokenize the texts and subsequently create a new set of files, each containing a set of tagged adjectives and verbs associated with each character.

The project is still in its early stages and may change quite significantly. Regular updates probably will not occur until late April/May.
