 DESCRIPTION OF FARMER OAK-- AN INCIDENT


, the corners of his mouth
 spread
---
till they were within an unimportant distance of
 his ears
---
ï»¿CHAPTER, his eyes were reduced to chinks, and.

---
His Christian name was Gabriel, and
---
on working
 days he was a young man of sound judgment, easy
 motions, proper dress, and general good character.
---
On
 Sundays he was a man of misty views,:  upon the whole, one who felt himself to
 occupy morally that vast middle space of Laodicean
 neutrality which lay between the Communion people
 of the parish and the drunken section,-- that is, he went
 to church, but yawned privately by the time
---
hampered by his best clothes and
 umbrella
---
the con-
 gegation reached the Nicene creed,- and thought of
 what there would be for dinner when he meant to be
 listening to the sermon.
---
Or, to state his character as
 it stood in the scale of public opinion,
---
when his friends
 and critics were in tantrums
---
, he was considered rather a
 bad man
---
;, he was rather a good
 man;
---
, he was a man whose
 moral colour was a kind of pepper- and- salt mixture.

---
Since he lived six times as many working- days as
 Sundays,
---
Oak's appearance in his old clothes was most
 peculiarly his own-- the mental picture formed by his
 neighbours in imagining him being always dressed in
 that way.
---
He wore a low- crowned felt hat,.

---
his lower
 extremities being encased in ordinary leather leggings
 and boots emphatically large, affording to each foot a
 roomy apartment
---
their maker being a conscientious man who
 endeavoured to compensate for any weakness in his cut
 by unstinted dimension and solidity
---
Mr. Oak carried about him, by way of watch,-

---
This instrument being several
 years older than Oak's grandfather
---
Oak remedied by thumps and shakes
---
The stopping peculiarity of his
 watch, and he
 escaped any evil consequences from the other two
 defects by constant comparisons with and observations
 of the sun and stars, and by pressing his face close
 to the glass of his neighbours' windows, till he could
 discern the hour marked by the green- faced timekeepers
 within.
---
Oak's fob being
 difficult of access, by reason of its somewhat high
 situation in the waistband of his trousers( which also
 lay at a remote height under his waistcoat)
---
who had seen him

---
But some thoughtfull persons, walking across one of his fields on a certain December
 morning-- sunny and exceedingly mild-- might have
 regarded Gabriel Oak in other aspects than these.
---
In
 his face one might notice
---
: there even
 remained in his remoter crannies some relics of the boy.

---
His height and breadth would have been sufficient to
,
---
make his presence imposing had they been exhibited
 with due consideration.
---
But there is a way some men
 have, rural and urban alike, for which the mind is more
 responsible than flesh and sinew:  it is a way of curtail-
 ing their dimensions by their manner of showing them.

---
And from a quiet modesty that would have become a
 vestal which seemed continually to impress upon him
 that he had no great claim on the world's room
---
, Oak
 walked unassumingly and with a faintly perceptible
 bend, yet distinct from a bowing of the shoulders.

---
if he
 depends for his valuation more upon his appearance
 than upon his capacity to wear well, which Oak did not
---
He had just reached the time of life at which" young"
 is ceasing to be the prefix of" man" in speaking of one.

---
He was at the brightest period of masculine growth,
 for his intellect and his emotions were clearly separated
---
:
 he had passed the time during which the influence of
 youth indiscriminately mingles them in the character
 of impulse, and.
---
he had not yet arrived at the stage

---
In
 short, he was twenty- eight, and a bachelor.

---
he was in this morning
---
Casually glancing over the hedge, Oak saw
.
---
Gabriel had not beheld the sight for more
 than half a minute,.

---
when the vehicle was brought to a
 standstill just beneath his eyes
---
He was not yet in sight; and
---
A
 cynical inference was irresistible by Gabriel Oak.
---
as he
 regarded the scene, generous though he fain would have
 been
---
, Gabriel withdrew
 from his point of espial, and,
.
---
where the object of his
 contemplation now halted for the payment of toll
---
About
 twenty steps still remained between him and the gate,
.
---
when he heard a dispute
---
Oak looked from one to the other of the disputants,
 and.
---
he said,;
---
He looked up at her then
---
Gabriel's features adhered throughout their form so
 exactly to the middle line between the beauty of St.
 John and the ugliness of Judas Iscariot,,.
---
he attended
---
" he said to Oak
" But
---
said Gabriel.

---
Gabriel, perhaps a little, glanced back to where he had
 witnessed her performance over the hedge, and."




 CHAPTER II



 NIGHT-- THE FLOCK-- AN INTERIOR-- ANOTHER INTERIOR



---
A desolating wind wandered
 from the north over the hill whereon Oak had watched
 the yellow waggon and its occupant in the sunshine of
 a few days earlier.
  
---
that he is in the presence of a shape approaching the
 indestructible as nearly as any to be found on earth
---
till he
 was now at a right angle with the meridian
---
They were the notes of Farmer Oak's flute.

---
During the twelvemonth pre-
 ceding this time he had been enabled by sustained
 efforts of industry and chronic good spirits to lease the
 small sheep farm of which Norcombe Hill was a portion,
 and stock it with two hundred sheep.
---
Previously he
 had been a bailiff for a short time, and earlier still a
 shepherd only, having from his childhood assisted his
 father in tending the flocks of large proprietors, till old
 Gabriel sank to rest.

---
This venture, unaided and alone, into the paths of
 farming as master and not as man, with an advance of
 sheep not yet paid for,
---
he recognised his position clearly.

---
The first movement in his new progress was, and
---
sheep having been his speciality from
 his" youth
---
the lambing
 of his ewes, he wisely refrained from deputing-- the task
 of tending them at this season to a hireling or a novice.

---
A rectangular space
 of light appeared in the side of the hut, and in the
 opening the outline of Farmer Oak's figure.
---
He carried
 a lantern in his hand, and.

---
closing the door behind him,
 came forward and, the lantern light appear-
 ing and disappearing here and there, and brightening
 him or darkening him as he stood before or behind it
---
Oak's motions,, were
 slow, and
---
their deliberateness accorded well with his
 occupation.
---
that his steady swings and turns"
 in and- about the flock had elements of grace,
---
he could do or
---
as can the men of towns
 who are more to the manner born
---
a wild slope had
 been appropriated by Farmer Oak for his great purpose

---
under which the whitish forms of his meek
 ewes moved and
---
which had been silent during his absence
---
till Oak withdrew again from the flock
---
he placed on a wisp of hay
 before the small stove, where a can of milk was simmer-
.
---
Oak extinguished the lantern by blowing into it
 and.
---
here the young man stretched himself along,.
---
In about the
 time a person unaccustomed to bodily labour would have
 decided upon which side to lie, Farmer Oak was asleep.

---
Passing
 from the profoundest sleep to the most alert wakefulness
 with the same ease, he looked at his watch,.
---
After
 placing the little creature with its mother, he stood and
.

---
One o'clock." said Gabriel.

---
that there was some charm in this life he led
---
Being a man not without a frequent consciousness
, he stood
 still after looking at the sky as a useful instrument, and

---
For a moment he seemed
 impressed with the speaking loneliness of the scene, or
 rather with the complete abstraction from all its compass
 of the sights and sounds of man.
---
there
 seemed to be on the shaded hemisphere of the globe no sentient
 being save himself; he could fancy them all.
  
---
Occupied this,, Oak gradually per-

---
what he had previously taken down behind the outskirts of the plantation
---
Farmer Oak went towards the plantation and.
---
A dim mass under
 the slope reminded him.
---
a combination of which made
 the radiance that had attracted him
---
Oak stepped up behind,
.
 
---
where, leaning down upon the roof and putting his eye close
 to a hole, he could see into the interior clearly
---
parently young and graceful; he could form no decided opinion
 upon her looks
---
, her position being almost beneath his eye, so
.
---
that he saw her in a bird's- eye view,
---
we were rich enough to pay a man to do these
 things
---
Oak, upon hearing these remarks, became more
 curious to observe her features, but
---
this prospect being
 denied him by the hooding effect of the cloak, and.
---
by his
 aerial position, he felt
---
himself drawing upon his fancy
 for their details
---
Had Gabriel
 been able from the first to get a distinct view of her-
 countenance, his estimate of it as very handsome or
 slightly
---
as his soul required a
 divinity at the moment or
---
Having for some time known the want of a satisfactory
 form to fill an increasing void within him, his position
 moreover affording the widest scope for his fancy
---
, he
 painted her a beauty.

---
Oak knew her instantly as the heroine of the yellow
 waggon, myrtles, and looking- glass:  prosily, as the
 woman who owed him twopence.

---
Gabriel
 Oak returned to his flock.




 CHAPTER III




---
for no particular reason save, Oak went again into
 the plantation.
---
Lingering and musing here, he heard
 the steps of a horse at the foot of the hill, and.
---
Gabriel instantly thought of the hat she had mentioned
 as having lost in the wind
---
He hastily scanned the ditch and after
 walking about ten yards along it
---
Gabriel took it in his hand and.
---
Here he ensconced himself, and.

---
Gabriel was about to advance and
 restore the missing article when an unexpected per-
 formance induced him to suspend the action for the
 present.
---
Gabriel's
 eyes had scarcely been able to follow her.
---
Oak was amused, perhaps a little astonished, and
 hanging up the hat in his hut
---
The boy led away the horse,.

---
Gabriel took the
 lost hat in his hand, and.

---
The left arm was extended as a balance, enough
 of it being shown bare to make Oak wish that the event
 ha happened in the summer, when the whole would
 have been revealed.
---
Gabriel's face rising like the
 moon behind the hedge
---
That the girl's thoughts hovered about her face
 and form as soon as she caught Oak's eyes conning the
 same page was natural, and almost certain.
---
as if
 Gabriel had been irritating its pink surface by actual
 touch, and
---
Yet it was the man who blushed, the maid not
 at all.

---
said Oak.

---
" You are Farmer Oak,
---
"" Here- going through the plantation" said Farmer Oak, with an aspect excessively
 knowing with regard to some matter in his mind, as he
 gazed at a remote point in the direction named, and
---
him to withdraw his own eyes
 from hers as suddenly as if he had been caught in a
 theft
---
The sympathetic man still looked the other way, and

---
He heard, and

---
Gabriel returned to his work.

---
His want of
 tact had deeply offended her-- not by seeing what he
 could not help, but by letting her know that he had
 seen it.
---
that Gabriel's espial had made her an indecorous woman
 without her own connivance
---
It was food for great regret
 with him
---
; it was also a contretemps which touched into
 life a latent heat he had experienced in that direction.

---
, Oak kept his usual
 watch upon the cowshed.
---
At last he felt cold, and
.
---
he entered the hut and
---
Oak laid a sack there and
---
Gabriel had always known.
---
Closing the slide to windward, he turned to
 open the other
---
that he would first sit down closed for a minute or two,
---
He sat down.

---
His head began, and,

---
fancying himself weary by reason of the broken rests of
 the preceding nights, Oak decided.
---
himself to fall asleep
---
He fell
 asleep, however, without having performed the necessary
 preliminary.

---
How long he remained unconscious
---
Gabriel never
 knew.
---
His dog was howling
---
, his head was aching fearfully--

---
somebody was pulling him about
---
, hands were loosening
 his neckerchief.

---
On opening his eyes he found to dusk in a strange manner of unexpectedness.
---
More than this-- astonishingly
 more-- his head was upon her lap,
---
his face and neck
 were disagreeably wet, and
---
her fingers were unbuttoning
 his collar.

---
"?" said Oak, vacantly.

---
" Ah, the hut!" murmured Gabriel.
---
Gabriel, by way of emphasis,
 brought down his fist upon the floor.

---
said Oak, absently.
---
He
 was endeavouring
---
, his head upon her dress, before
 the event passed on into the heap of bygone things.

---
He wished; but
---
he would as
 soon have thought of carrying an odour in a net as of
 attempting to convey the intangibilities of his feeling
 in the coarse meshes of language.
---
So he remained
 silent.

---
him sit up
---
then Oak began."
---
How
 can I thank' ee?"
---
he said at."
---
last, gratefully, some of the
 natural rusty red having returned to his face
---
her smile to hold good for Gabriel's next
 remark, whatever that might prove to be
---
" I heard
---
when I came to the milking
---
I shall not come here after this week or the next).
---
I came across and.
---
My
 uncle has a hut like this one, and
---
I have heard.
---
him tell

---
his shepherd not to go to sleep without leaving a slide
 open
---
I opened the door, and
---
I threw the milk over you,,."

---
" I wonder?"
---
if I should have died
---
Gabriel said, in a
 low voice, which was rather meant to travel back to
 himself than to her.

---
" My name is Gabriel Oak."

---
You seem fond of yours in
, Gabriel Oak."

---
He held it but an instant, and
---
he said, the instant after.

---
Oak held it longer this time-- indeed, curiously long.

---
he said.

---
said Gabriel,
 simply;" but
---
I will"

---
Gabriel felt himself guilty of another want of tact.

---
THE MISTAKE


 THE only superiority in women is, as a rule, that of the unconscious kind; but
 a superiority which recognizes itself may sometimes
 please by suggesting possibilities of capture to the
 subordinated man.

---
every morning Oak's feelings
 were as sensitive as the money- market in calculations
 upon his chances
---
His dog waited for his meals in a
 way so like that in which Oak waited for the girl's
 presence,,.
---
However, he continued, and
---
thus his sentiments
 towards her were deepened without any corresponding
 effect being produced upon herself.
---
Oak had nothing
, and;
 passionate tales--
     -- Full of sound and fury
   -- signifying nothing--

---
finished and ready to say as yet not being able
 to frame love phrases he said no word at all.

---
By making inquiries he found.
---
He dreaded the eight day.

---
Gabriel had reached a
 pitch of existence he never could have anticipated a
 short time before.
---
He liked saying` Bathsheba' as a
 private enjoyment instead of whistling;.
---
though he had sworn by brown ever

---
since he was a boy
---
he
 filled in a possible strength in an actual weakness
---
Oak
 began now, and
---
I'll make her my wife, or
---
I shall

---
while he was perplexing himself about an
 errand on which he might consistently visit the cottage
 of Bathsheba's aunt
---
He found his opportunity in the death of a ewe,
 mother of a living lamb.
---
On a day- a fine January
 morning, make an
 occasional gleam of silvery sunshine, Oak put the lamb
 into a respectable Sunday basket, and
---
Gabriel had watched the blue wood- smoke curling
 from the chimney with strange meditation.
---
At evening
 he had fancifully traced it down the chimney to the
 spot of its origin--
---
equally with her person included in the compass of his
 affection
---
for the
 clothes were by association
; they seemed at this early time of his love a
 necessary ingredient of the sweet mixture called Bath-
 sheba Everdene.

---
He had made a toilet of a nicely- adjusted kind-- of a
 nature between the carefully neat and the carelessly
 ornate-- of a degree between fine- market- day and wet-
 Sunday selection.
---
He thoroughly cleaned his silver
 watch- chain with whiting,.

---
he possessed upon his usually dry, sandy, and
 inextricably curly hair
---
till he had deepened it to a
 splendidly novel colour, between that of guano and
 Roman cement,
---
it stick to his head like mace

---
that the omen was an
 unpropitious one, for, as the rather untoward commence-
 ment of Oak's overtures,
---
just as he arrived by the garden
 gate
---
, he saw a cat inside,.

---
for he had arrived at an age
 at which all superfluous barking was cynically avoided
 as a waste of breath--
---
in fact he never barked even
 at the sheep except to order, when it was done with
 an absolutely neutral countenance, as a sort of Com-
 mination- service, which, though offensive, had to be
 gone through once now and then to frighten the flock
 for their own good.

---
;-- did he
---
" I beg your pardon."
---
said Oak to the voice," but

---
Almost before he had ceased speaking
---
, Oak was
 seized with a misgiving as to whose ear was the recipient
 of his answer.
---
he heard the
 person retreat among the bushes.

---
Gabriel meditated, and so deeply that he brought
 small furrows into his forehead by sheer force of
 reverie.
---
Oak went up to the door a little
:  his mental rehearsal and the reality.

---
" said Mr. Oak.
---
" Oh, thank' ee," said Gabriel,.
---
" I've brought a lamb for Miss Everdene.

---
I thought
---
"," said Gabriel,.
---
In short, I was going."

---
Because, I should be very glad
 to marry her.
---
any other young
 man hanging about her at all
---
Not
 that her young men ever come here-- but
---
said Farmer Oak, contemplating
 a crack in the stone floor with sorrow.
---
I'm only an
 every- day sort of man, and
---
I came about
---
",
 for that was all: so I'll take myself off
 home- along, Mrs. Hurst."

---
When Gabriel had gone about two hundred yards along the
 down
---
, he heard a" hoi- hoi!"
---
He looked round, and.

---
Oak stood still-- and
---
Gabriel's colour deepened:.

---
to see you," said Gabriel,.

---
" Yes- I know that!"
---
he said, with a grateful sense of
."
---
"-- It was a young man" already."- Bathsheba went on."
---
I had

---
I have n't
 a sweetheart at all-- and
---
I never had one, and
---
I thought
."

---
that I had several
---
" Really and truly I am glad to hear that!"
---
said
 Farmer Oak,.
---
He held out his hand
---
Directly he seized it she put
 it behind her, so that it slipped through his fingers like
 an eel."

---
" I have a nice snug little farm."
---
said Gabriel, with
 half a degree less assurance than when he had seized
 her hand.

---
" A man has advanced me money to begin with, but

---
though I am only an
 every- day sort of man
---
, I have got on a little
---
since I was
 a boy
---
Gabriel uttered" a little" in a tone to- show
 her."

---
, I am quite sure
 I can work twice as hard as I do now
---
He went forward and.

---
his advance take the form of an attitude

---
" she said, over the top, looking
 at him with rounded eyes," I never said I was going to
."
" Well-- that is a tale!"
---
said Oak,  with dismay.
---
you do n't
 want him
---
I meant
---
Oak added with a more appreciative sense
 of all the circumstances--"."

---
said Gabriel
---
I'll wait a while, Miss Everdene.
---
I love you far more
 than common!"

---
" I'll try.
---
," said he to the back of her
 head, across the bush.
---
I'll practise up the flute right well
---
" Yes; I should like that."

---
I mean,."
---
" I should like it very much."

---
" Dearly I should like that!"

---
And at home by the fire,,
 there I shall be-- and
---
whenever I look up there
---
He regarded the red berries between them over and
 over again, to such an extent,.
---
" Why, he'd always be there,
---
;, there he'd be."

---
Of course he would
---
said Oak."
---
he continued in a palliative voice,
---
Oak sighed a deep honest sigh-- none the
 less so in that,
---
he appealed,
.

---
" I can not.
---
" he persisted,.
"."

---
" Never." said Mr Oak, so earnestly that he seemed
 to be coming, by the force of his words, straight
 through the bush and into her arms.
---
I shall do one
 thing in this life-- one thing certain--
---
till I die
---
His
 voice had a genuine pathos now, and
---
his large brown
 hands perceptibly trembled.

---
Oak cast his eyes down the field in a way implying
 that it was useless to attempt argument.

---
he naively said.

---
Farmer Oak had one- and- a- half Christian character-
 istics too many:  his humility,
 and a superfluous moiety of honesty.
---
He broke in passionately."
---
your uncle at Weatherbury is,.
---
he said, with a laugh
---
No man likes the sport of a
 merry- go- round of skittishness."
---
Very well." said Oak,
 firmly, with the bearing of one who was going to give"
 his days and nights to Ecclesiastes for ever.
---
Then
 I'll ask you no more."




 CHAPTER V



 DEPARTURE OF BATHSHEBA--
---
which one day reached Gabriel
---
THE news,, had an
 influence upon him which might have surprised any
 who never suspected that the more emphatic the renun-
 ciation the less absolute its character.

---
offered to Gabriel Oak by
 Bathsheba's disappearance though effectual with people
 of certain humours
---
Oak belonged
 to the even- tempered order of humanity, and.

---
His incipient friendship with her aunt- had been
 nipped by the failure of his suit, and
---
Gabriel had two dogs.
---
that George knew the exact degrees of condemnation
 signified by cursing and swearing of all descriptions
 better than the wickedest old man in the neighbourhood
---
that he knew to a hair's
 breadth the rate of trotting back from the ewes' tails
 that each call involved, if a staggerer with the sheep
 crook was to be escaped.
---
Though old, he was clever
 and trustworthy still.

---
for there was not much
 resemblance between him and George
---
He was,.
---
( he had no,
 name in particular, and)
---
that if sent behind the
 flock to help them on, he did it so thoroughly that he
 would have chased them across the whole county with
 the greatest pleasure if not called off or reminded when
 to step by the example of old George
---
when Farmer Oak had returned to, his
 house
---
there would be no further necessity for
 his attendance on the down
---
One night,, believing, he called as usual to the
 dogs,.
---
- Gabriel then remembered
---
that he had left the
 two dogs on the hill except when other food- ran
 finished his meal
---
he usually kept from them
---
eating a dead lamb( a kind of meat
,, he went indoors to the luxury of a bed,
.

---
which latterly he had only enjoyed on Sundays
---
he was

---
The
 experienced ear of Oak knew the sound he now heard
 to be caused by the running of the flock with great
 velocity.

---
He jumped out of bed,.
---
there being two hundred
 of the latter class in Gabriel's flock
---
as he had left them
---
Gabriel called at the top of
 his voice the shepherd's call.

---
He went to the hedge-- a gap
 had been broken through it, and in the gap were the
 footprints of the sheep.
---
Rather surprised to find
 putting it down
 instantly to their great fondness for ivy in winter- time,
, he followed
 through the hedge.
---
He called again:  the valleys and farthest hills resounded
 as when the sailors invoked the lost Hylas on the Mysian
 shore; but no sheep.
---
He passed through the trees and
 along the ridge of the hill.
---
On the extreme summit,
, he saw.

---
A horrible conviction darted through Oak.
---
With
 a sensation of bodily faintness he advanced:  at one
 point the rails were broken through, and
---
there he saw
 the footprints of his ewes.
---
that he expected
 some great reward for signal services rendered
---
Oak
 looked over the precipice.
---
Oak was an intensely humane man: indeed
---
, his
 humanity often tore in pieces any politic intentions of
 his which bordered on strategy, and.
---
carried him on as
 by gravitation
---
A shadow in his life had always been
.
---
that his flock ended in mutton--
---
His first feeling now was one of pity for the
 untimely fate of these gentle ewes and their unborn
 lambs.

---
; his hopes
 of being an independent farmer were laid low-- possibly
 for ever.
---
Gabriel's energies, patience, and industry had
 been so severely taxed during the years of his life between
 eighteen and eight- and- twenty,.
---
Farmer
 Oak recovered from his.
---
It was as remarkable as it was
 characteristic that the one sentence he uttered was in
 thankfulness: --

---
Oak raised his head, and.
---
what he could
 do listlessly surveyed the scene
---
The pool glittered like a dead
 man's eye, and as the world awoke a breeze blew,
 shaking and elongating the reflection of the moon
 without breaking it, and turning the image of the star
 to a phosphoric streak upon the water.
---
All this Oak
 saw and.

---
since he was
 kept for running after sheep
---
that, the more he ran after
 them the better,
---
that the poor
 young dog, still under the impression had at the end of his meal off the
 dead lamb,, collected all the ewes into a corner, driven
 the timid creatures through the hedge, across the upper
 field, and by main force of worrying had given them
 momentum enough to break down a portion of the
 rotten railing
---
George's son had done his work so thoroughly that
 he was considered too good a workman to live, and was,
 in fact, taken and tragically shot at twelve o'clock that
 same day
---
Gabriel's farm had been stocked by a dealer-- on the
 strength of Oak's promising look and character-- who
 was receiving a percentage from the farmer till such
 time as the advance should be cleared off Oak found-
.





---
which
 were really his own
---
that the value of stock, plant, and implements would be about sufficient to pay his
 debts, leaving himself a free man with the clothes he
 stood up in, and nothing more
---
At one end of the street stood from two to three
 hundred blithe and hearty labourers waiting upon Chance
 -- all men of the stamp carters and waggoners were distinguished by

---
what superior appearance to the rest-- in fact, his
 superiority was marked enough.
---
His
 answer always was,

---
Gabriel was paler now.
---
His eyes were more medi-
 tative, and
---
his expression was more sad.
---
He had
 passed through an ordeal of wretchedness which had
.
---
He had sunk
 from his modest elevation as pastoral king into the very
 slime- pits of Siddim; but
---
there was left to him a digni-
 fied calm he had never before known, and that indiffer-
 ence to fate which, though it often makes a villain of
 a man, is the basis of his sublimity when it does not.

---
a sergeant and his party had been beating up
 for recruits through the four streets.
---
he found.
---
himself not hired,
---
Gabriel
 almost wished
---
that he had joined them, and
---
he
 turned his hand to
---
, he decided.

---
Sheep- tending was Gabriel's speciality.
---
Turning down
 an obscure street and entering an obscurer lane, he went
 up to a smith's shop.

---
He sat on a bench and
---
a stem
 being given him into the bargain
---
He then went to a ready- made clothes' shop,.
---
As the
 crook had absorbed most of Gabriel's money
---
, he
 attempted, and.

---
, he again
 hurried off to the centre of the town, and.

---
that Oak had turned himself into a shepherd
---
However, two
 or three farmers noticed him and.
---
Gabriel, like his dog, was
 too good to be trustworthy,.
---
and he never made advance
 beyond this point.

---
Some merry men were whistling and
 singing by the corn- exchange.
---
which
 had lain for some time idle in his smock- frock pocket
---
Gabriel's hand,,
 touched his flute which he carried there.
---
Here was
 an opportunity for putting his dearly bought wisdom
 into practice.

---
He drew out his flute and.
---
Oak could pipe with Arcadian
 sweetness and
---
the sound of the well- known notes
 cheered his own heart as well as those of the loungers.

---
He played on with spirit, and in half an hour had
 earned in pence what was a small fortune to a destitute
 man.

---
By making inquiries he learnt.

---
Oak resolved.

---
if Oak kept
---
if he
 stopped
---
He passed by Yalbury- Wood
.

---
By the time he had walked.
---
He descended Yalbury Hill and could just
 discern ahead of him a waggon, drawn up under a great
 over- hanging tree by the roadside.

---
On coming close, he found.

---
Gabriel sat down on the shafts of the vehicle and con-
.
---
He calculated.

---
that he had walked
 a very fair proportion of the journey; and
---
having been
 on foot since daybreak, he felt
---
Eating his las slices of bread and ham, and drinking
 from the bottle of cider he had taken the precaution to

---
bring with him, he got into the lonely waggon.
---
Here
 he spread half of the hay as a bed, and, as well as he
.
---
he had been
 in his life
---
Inward melancholy it was impossible for
 a man like Oak, introspective far beyond his neighbours,
 to banish quite, whilst conning the present.
---
So, thinking of his misfortunes,
 amorous and pastoral he fell asleep, shepherds enjoying,
 in common with sailors, the privilege of being able to
 summon the god instead of having to wait for him.

---
whose length he had no idea
---
On somewhat suddenly awaking after a sleep of
, Oak found.
---
He was being carried along the road
 at a rate rather considerable for a vehicle without
 springs, and
---
under circumstances of physical uneasiness,
 his head being dandled up and down on the bed of
 the waggon like a kettledrum- stick.
---
His concern at this dilemma
(, had he been a thriving
 man; but
---
the first
 sight he beheld was the stars above him.
---
Gabriel concluded,.

---
that he had slept two hours
---
whilst he was stealthily turning
.

---
into whose hands he had fallen
---
Gabriel soon found, and
---
It came
" from the man who held the reins.

---
that' a can make a psalm tune sound as
 well as the merriest loose song a man can wish for
---
On hearing these and other similar remarks, a wild
 thought flashed into Gabriel's mind.
---
, Gabriel slipped out of the waggon unseen.

---
He turned to an opening in the hedge, which he
 found to be a gate, and mounting thereon
---
, he sat
.
---
The crunching jangle of the
 waggon died upon his ear.
---
He was about to walk on,
.
---
when he noticed on his left hand an unusual light
---
Oak watched it,
 and
---
Gabriel again mounted the gate, and,.
---
what he found
---
The blaze, enlarging in a  double ratio by his
 approach and its own increase, showed him.
---
as he drew
 nearer the outlines of ricks beside it,
---
His weary face now began, and
---
the whole front of his smock-
 frock and gaiters was covered with a dancing shadow
 pattern of thorn- twigs--.
---
the light reaching him through
 a leafless intervening hedge-- and the metallic curve of
 his sheep- crook shone silver- bright in the same abound-
 ing rays
---
He came up to the boundary fence, and

---
This before Gabriel's eyes was a-
---
, tongues hanging from lips, glaring
 eyes, and other impish forms, Oak suddenly ceased from being a mere spectator
 by discovering the case to be more serious than he had
 at first imagined.
---
A scroll of smoke blew aside and
 and behind this a series of
 others, composing the main corn produce of the farm;
 so that instead of the straw- stack standing, as he had
 imagined comparatively isolated, there was a regular
 connection between it and the remaining stacks of the
 group.

---
that he was
 not alone
---
he came
---
as if his thoughts were several
 yards in advance of his body, which they could never
 drag on fast enough
---
Other figures now
 appeared behind this shouting man and among the
 smoke, and
---
Gabriel found.

---
that, far from being alone
 he was in a great company-- whose shadows danced
 merrily up and down, timed by the jigging of the
 flames, and not at all by their owners' movements
---
cried
 Gabriel to those nearest to him.
---
I feel quite
 a new man!" That I do n't know, Master Poorgrass."
-- I mane a bad servant and a good
 master O, Mark Clark--!" Get a tarpaulin-- quick!" said Gabriel.

---
said Gabriel again.

---
cried Gabriel.

---
Oak seized the cut ends of the sheaves,
---
as if he
 were going
---
to engage in the operation of" reed- drawing,"
 and digging in his feet, and occasionally sticking in the
 stem of his sheep- crook, he clambered up the beetling
 face.
---
He at once sat astride the very apex, and and some water.

---
with his crook to beat off the fiery fragments which had
 lodged thereon,
---
Billy Smallbury-- one of the men-- by this time had found a ladder, which
 Mark Clark ascended, holding on beside Oak upon the
 thatch.
---
" He's a shepherd."
---
" Yes--
 he is.
---
how his crook shines
---
as he beats the rick
 with it
---
And his smock- frock is burnt in two holes,
---
he is too, ma'am
---
" Whose shepherd is he?
---
" D'ye think, Jan Coggan?
---
-- he
 sitting on the top o' rick,."

---
" He does work hard."
---
he was shepherd here
---
Do n't
 any of you know his name."

---
Gabriel's elevated
 position being no longer required of him
---
, he made.

---
as he comes down
---
he has done
---
his features smudged, from the smoke and heat, his smock- frock burnt- into
 holes and dripping with water
---
Oak, grimy, and undiscoverable
, the ash stem of his sheep-
 crook charred six inches shorter,.
---
He lifted his
 hat with respect, and not without gallantry: stepping
 close to her hanging feet?"

---
he said in a hesitating voice,--
"
---
Gabriel and his cold- hearted
 darling, Bathsheba Everdene, were face to face.

---
he mechanically
 repeated in an abashed and sad voice,--
"?"




 CHAPTER VII



 RECOGNITION--
---
There was room for a little pity, also for a very little
 exultation:  the former at his position, the latter at her
 own.
---
Gabriel's declaration of love to her at Norcombe only
 to think
---
putting on an air of dignity,
 and turning again to him with a little warmth of cheek;
" I do want a shepherd.
---
" He's the very man, ma'am.
---
" The man, truly!" said a third, with heartiness.
---
" He's all there!"
---
Then will you tell him
---
Venus the well- known and admired, retired with him to
 talk over the necessary preliminaries of hiring.

---
the
 men straggled on to the village in twos and threes-- Oak
 and the bailiff being left by the rick alone.

---
That I ca n't," he said,
---
he does
 not mean
---
", I daresay.
---
who showed this nervous dread of loving
 his neighbour as himself
---
Oak
 walked on to the village,.
---
Obliged, to some extent, to forgo dreaming in order
 to find the way, he reached the churchyard, and.

---
Gabriel's footsteps were deadened by its softness, even
 at this indurating period of the year.
---
When abreast of
 a trunk to be the oldest of the old, he
 became aware that a figure was standing behind it.

---
Gabriel did not pause in his walk, and
---
in another
 moment he accidentally kicked a loose stone.
---
" said Gabriel, heartily.

---
Gabriel resumed,.

---
to be won by
 Gabriel's heartiness
---
as Gabriel had been won by her
 modulations
---
You are not a Weatherbury man?
---
Gabriel repeated, in a dull cadence
 of finality."
---
His thoughts were directed to the past, his
 eyes to the feet of the girl; and for the first time he
 saw lying there a bundle of some sort.
---
perceived the direction of his face,,--
" You wo n't say anything in the parish about having
 seen me here,
---
said Oak.

---
I do n't want." 
---
to have a cloak on such a cold night,"
 Gabriel observed.
---
" I would advise' ee."

---
I thank you much for what you have told me."

---
" I will go on.
---
" he said;.
---
" Yes, I will take it."
---
Gabriel's fingers alighted on the young woman's wrist.

---
He had
 frequently felt the same quick, hard beat in the femoral
 artery of-- his lambs when overdriven.
---
Gabriel descended into the village of Weatherbury, or
 Lower Longpuddle.
---
He
 fancied.
---
that he had felt himself in the penumbra of a
 very deep sadness
---
Gabriel endeavoured.





---
Oak's hand skimmed the surface of the door with
 fingers extended to an Elymas- the- Somerer pattern,.
---
till
 he found a leathern strap, which he pulled
---
A curved settle of unplaned oak
 stretched along one side, and
---
This aged man was now sitting opposite the fire.
---
, his
 frosty white hair and beard overgrowing his gnarled
 figure like the grey moss and lichen upon a leafless
 apple- tree
---
He wore breeches and the laced- up shoes

---
called ankle- jacks; he kept his eyes fixed upon the
 fire.

---
Gabriel's nose was greeted by an atmosphere laden
 with the sweet smell of new malt.
---
every one ocularly criticised
 him to the degree expressed by contracting the flesh of
 their foreheads and looking at him with narrowed eye-
 lids,.

---
as if he had been a light too strong for their sight
---
The ancient maltster sitting in the midst turned up
 this-- his turning being as the turning of a rusty
 crane.

---
" That's never Gable Oak's grandson over at Nor-
 combe-- never!"
---
he said, as a formula expressive of
 surprise,'.

---
" My father and my grandfather were old men of the
 name of Gabriel."
---
said Mr. Oak.

---
I knowed the man's face as I seed him
 on the rick I did" I'm thinking of biding here."" Ah-- and did you!"

---
when he was a child
---
Why, my boy Jacob there and your father were sworn
 brothers--
---
" Ay, sure." said his son, a young man about sixty-
 five, with a semi- bald head and one tooth in the left
 centre of his upper jaw, which made much of itself by
 standing prominent, like a milestone in a bank."
---
Joe had most to do with him
---
" said Jacob's son Billy, a child
 of forty, or thereabouts, who manifested the peculiarity
 of possessing a cheerful soul in a gloomy body, and
 whose whiskers were assuming a chinchilla shade here
 and there.

---
" I can mind Andrew." said Oak," as being a man in
 the place when I was quite a child.
---
" Ay-- the other day I and my youngest daughter,
 Liddy, were over at my grandson's christening."
---
you know, shepherd, and I can mind the day
 because they all had to traypse up to the vestry-- yes,
 this very man's family."

---
Jacob stooped to the God- forgive- me, which was a
 two- handled tall mug standing in the ashes, cracked
 and charred with heat: 
---
any given toper feel ashamed of himself
---
when he sees
 its bottom in drinking it empty
---
Jacob, on receiving the order to see, placidly dipped his forefinger into it by
 way of thermometer, and.

---
because Shepherd Oak
 was a stranger
---
" No-- not at all," said Gabriel, in a reproving tone
 of considerateness.
---
I never fuss about dirt in its pure
 state, and."
---
when I know
---
Taking the
 mug he drank an inch or more from the depth of its
 contents, and.

---
" continued Oak in a moister tone,
 after recovering from the stoppage of breath occasioned by pulls at large mugs.

---
" A right sensible man." said Jacob.

---
observed a brisk
 young man-- Mark Clark by name, a genial and pleasant
 gentleman, whom to meet anywhere in your travels
---
for I let
---
as
 I was bringing it along, and
---
said the friendly Oak.

---
" Ah, he's his grandfer's own grandson!--
---
his grandfer
 were just such a nice unparticular man!"
---
magnanimously said
 Jan Coggan, a person who held Saint- Simonian notions
 of share and share alike where liquor was concerned,.

---
as
 the vessel showed signs of approaching him in its gradual
 revolution among them
---
He was a man
 of more than middle age, with eyebrows high up in his
 forehead, who laid it down that the law of the world
 was bad, with a long- suffering look through his listeners
 at the world alluded to, as it presented itself to his
 imagination.
---
He always signed his name" Henery"--

---
to remark, he received the
 reply that " H- e- n- e- r- y"
---
he was christened

---
he would stick to
---
Mr. Jan Coggan,,
 was a crimson man with a spacious countenance, and
 private glimmer in his eye, whose name had appeared
 on the marriage register of Weatherbury and neighbour-
 ing parishes as best man and chief witness in countless
 unions of the previous twenty years
---
; he also very
 frequently filled the post of head godfather in baptisms
 of the subtly- jovial kind.

---
that I will
---
Mr.
 Clark, who, twenty years younger than Jan Coggan,
 revolved in the same orbit
---
He secreted mirth on all
 occasions for special discharge at popular parties.

---
said
 Mr. Coggan to a self- conscious man in the background,
.

---
as he is
---
" Such a modest man!" said Jacob Smallbury.

---
I hear, Joseph?"

---
All looked at Joseph Poorgrass with pitying reproach.

---
" No-- I've hardly looked at her at all."
---
when I seed her
---
said Jan Coggan.

---
" Yes." continued Joseph Poorgrass-- his shyness,
 which was so painful as a defect, filling him with a
 mild complacency now that it was regarded as an
 interesting study."
---
I believe ye, Joseph Poorgrass,
---
"' Tis a' awkward gift for a man, poor soul." said the
 maltster."
---
ever since I was a boy" Did ye ever go into the world,
 Joseph Poorgrass?"

---
And then I
 was put errand- man at the Women's Skittle Alley at the
 back of the Tailor's Arms in Casterbridge.' I had; but-- I
 was just as- bad as ever after all. that I be no worse" True." said Jacob Smallbury,."
---
even
 as you be,' tis a very bad affliction for' ee, Joseph.
---
said Gabriel,.
---
he's very timid, too."
---
observed Jan Coggan.

---
Once he had been working late at Yalbury Bottom,
 and
---
as he was
 coming home- along through Yalbury Wood
---
expostulated the
 modest man,.

---
And so' a lost himself quite."
---
as he was coming along
 in the middle of the night
---
And, much afeared, and not able
 to find his way out of the trees nohow,' a cried out,
" Man- a- lost! man- a- lost!"
---
as owls do, you
 know, shepherd"( Gabriel nodded)," and Joseph, all
 in a tremble
---
said the timid
 man,.

---
" I did n't say sir.
---
I'll tike my oath
---
I did n't say" Joseph
 Poorgrass o' Weatherbury, sir."
---
that no man of a gentleman's rank would be

---
, Jan went on meditatively: --

---
I never said sir to the bird, I should n't ha' said that if' t had n't been for Keeper
 Day's metheglin...." And he's the fearfullest man, bain't ye, Joseph?

---
how he would
---
try, and knowing
, he kneeled down.
---
" I was." replied Poorgrass,,.
"" Ay." said Joseph,.

---
A meditation on the obvious inference was indulged
 in by all, and during its continuance each directed his
 vision into the ashpit, which glowed like a desert in
 the tropics under a vertical sun, shaping their eyes long
 and liny, partly because of the light, partly from the
 depth of the subject discussed.
  
---
Gabriel broke the silence.
---
Gabriel's bosom thrilled gently the inner-

---
as he
 thus slipped under the notice of the assembly
---
Her uncle was took
 bad, and
---
the doctor was called with his world- wide
 skill; but
---
he could n't save the man.
---
Jan
 uncle was a very fair sort of man
---
Her
 uncle was a very fair sort of man.
---
who was his dairymaid
---
Well, a very good-
 hearted man were Farmer Everdene, and.
---
I wished
 as I could which
 would have been insulting the man's generosity -- --"
  " True, Master Coggan,' twould so
---
as I
 used" I can-- I can." said Jacob.
---
But for a wet of the better class, that
 brought you no nearer to the horned man afore, there was none like those in Farmer
 Everdene's kitchen.
---
did any of you know Miss Everdene's- father
 and mother?
---
," he was n't much; but
---
He was fond enough
 of her as his sweetheart."
  
---
" observed Coggan.
  
---
He was very proud of her, too,,.
---
as I've been told
---
" Ay." said Coggan."
---
He admired her so much that
 he used to light the candle three time a night to look
 at her."
  
---
" Boundless love; I should n't have supposed it in the
 universe!" murmered Joseph Poorgrass, who habitually
 spoke on a large scale in his moral reflections.
  " Well, to be sure." said Gabriel.
  
---
I knowed the man and
 woman both well.
---
that was the man's
 name, sure.
---
he were
 of a higher circle of life than that--'
---
And he became
 a very celebrated bankrupt two or three times.
---
" Oh, I thought!
---
he was quite a common man
---
" said
 Joseph.
  
---
That man failed for heaps of money;
 hundreds in gold and silver."
  
---
he could n't help it.
---
The poor
 feller were faithful and true enough to her in his wish,
 but
---
his heart would rove.
---
what he would
---
He spoke
 to me in real tribulation about it once."
---
he said,"
---
I could never wish for a handsomer woman
, but
---
than I've got
---
feeling, I ca n't help,
---
what
 I will
---
But at last I believe
---
he cured it by making her
 take off her wedding- ring and calling her by her maiden
 name as they sat together after the shop was shut, and

---
as he could

---
And as soon thoroughly fancy he was doing wrong and
---
, he might have gone the bad road and

---
The man's will was
, but
---
his heart did n't chime in."
  
---
He got so much better,
---
that he was quite godly
 in his later years
---
", was n't he, Jan?
---
He got, and
---
himself confirmed over again in a more
 serious way, and
---
he liked.
---
He used, too,; and
---
he kept a
 missionary box upon his table to nab folks unawares
 when they called; yes, and."
  
---
he would- box the charity-
 boys' ears,,
---
" Ay, at that time he thought of nothing but high
 things."
---
when he seed a parson-
  "
---
" A queer Christian, like the Devil's head in a cowl,
  " He is.."
---
that man would as soon tell a lie Sundays as
 working- days--
---
Between we two, man and man, I
 believe that I do so."
 " said Gabriel.
  
---
" True enough." said the man of bitter moods,.'
---
than ordinary men are capable of
---
that man
 -- bless your souls!"
  
---
Gabriel thought fit.
---
You
 must be a very aged man, malter,
---
" to have" he remarked.
  
---
that' a ca n't mind his age
---
And he growled terrible
 crooked too, lately" Jacob continued, surveying his
 father's figure, which was rather more bowed than his own.

---
that father there is three- double
---
that I should" said Gabriel with the heartiness
 of a man who had longed to hear it for several months.

---
The maltster cleared his throat in an exaggerated
 form for emphasis, and!
---
Well, I do n't mind the year I were
 born in, but
---
perhaps I can reckon up the places I've
, and.
---
I bode at Upper Long-
 puddle across there"()".
---
till I were
 eleven
---
I bode seven at Kingsbere"()".
---
where I took to malting
---
I went therefrom to
 Norcombe, and
---
I was there turnip- hoeing and
 harvesting.
---
Ah, I knowed that old place, Norcombe,
 years afore you were thought of, Master Oak"
---
( Oak smiled
 sincere belief in the fact)."
---
Then I malted at Dur-
 nover four year, and four year turnip- hoeing; and

---
I was fourteen times eleven months at Millpond St.
 Jude's"().
---
Then I was three year at
 Mellstock, and
---
I've been here.
---
" O no, father!" said Jacob.
---
I lived through the summers,
---
did n't
 I?
---
I suppose?
---
I be
 no age at all to speak of
---
" said Gabriel,
---
attested Jan
 must have a wonderful talented constitution to be able
 to live so long, must n't he, neighbours?"
  
---
The maltster, being know pacified, was even generous
 enough to voluntarily disparage in a slight degree the
 virtue of having lived a great many years, by mentioning
 that the cup they were drinking out of was three years
 older than he.
  
---
, the end of
 Gabriel Oak's flute became visible over his smock- frock
 I seed you blowing into a great flute by now at Caster-
 bridge?"
  
---
said Gabriel,.
---
I've been
 in great trouble, neighbours, and.

---
" Neither drum nor trumpet have I heard since
 Christmas.
---
" said Jan Coggan.
---
" That I will.."
---
" said Gabriel,
---
such as I can do
---
Oak then struck up" Jockey to the Fair." and.
  
---
" He can blow the flute very well-- that' a can."
---
a young married man, mentioning was known as" Susan Tall's husband
---
He
 continued," I'd as lief as not be able to blow into a
 flute as well- as that."
  
---
He's a clever man, and.
---
"" murmured Joseph Poorgrass, in
 a soft cadence.
---
that he's not a player of ba'dy songs' instead of these
 merry tunes
---
as what he is
---
" True, true,-- real thanksgiving!" dashed in Mark
 Clark conclusively, not feeling it quence to his opinion that he had only heard about a
 word and three- quarters of what Joseph had said.
  
---
" Yes." added Joseph,;
---
if I may term it so
---
Ay, I can mind yer face now, shepherd."
---
as he
 entered upon his second tune
---
-- now I see' ee
 blowing into the flute I know' ee to be the same man
 I see play at Casterbridge, for yer mouth were scrimped
 up and yer eyes a- staring out like a strangled man's--
."
  
---
that playing the flute should make a man

---
observed Mr. Mark Clark, with
 additional criticism of Gabriel's countenance, the latter
 person jerking out, with the ghastly grimace required by
 the instrument, the chorus of" Dame Durden!
  
---
you do n't mind that young man's bad
 manners in naming your features
---
" I hope?.
  " Not at all." said Mr. Oak.
  
---
Oak, in the modest
 tone good manners demanded,
---
that
 he would never let;
---
him playing the
 flute
---
himself left out of the subject
---
It came from the old man in the
 background, he con-

---
" O no, no." said Gabriel.
  
---
" said Susan Tall's
 husband, the young married man who had spoken once
 before.
---
I must be moving and
---
" going on I seem.
---
If I thought after

---
I'd left, and
---
I not there, I
 should be quite melancholy- like."
  
---
" inquired Coggan.

---
", I was, and, and
---
, I suppose,"

---
" Ay,' a b'lieve-- ha, ha!" said Susan Tall's husband,
 in a tone intended to imply his habitual reception of
 jokes without minding them at all.  
---
The young man
 then wished them good- night and.
  
---
Then Gabriel
 arose and.
---
Flourishing his finger ominously
 he threw a gaze teeming with tidings just-- where his eye
 alighted by accident, which happened to be in Joseph
 Poorgrass's face.
  
---
" said Joseph,.
  
---
" to cut a long story short,
 he owned to having carried off five sack altogether, upon
 her promising not to persecute him.
---
Well, he's turned
 out neck and crop, and
---
Before
 he had replaced it on the table
---
, in came the young man,
 Susan Tall's husband, in a still greater hurry.
  
---
" Have ye heard the news that's all over parish?"
  " About Baily Pennyways?"
  " But besides that?"
  
---
came from Joseph
 Poorgrass's dry lips.
  
---
whom neither news, fire,
 rain, nor thunder could draw from his hole
---
he sat down again and

---
" Are any of my men among you?
---
" Yes, ma'am, several." said Susan Tall's husband.
  
---
if
 he had been a respectable lad
---
said Jacob,.
---
I think,
---
though I could n't see
 very well
---
he's a soldier
---
I believe."
  " Do you know his name?"
---
which man it is
---
That night at Coggan's, Gabriel Oak, beneath the
 screen of closed eyelids, was busy with fancies, and full
 of movement, like a river flowing rapidly under its ice.

---
Night had always been the time at which he saw Bath-
 sheba most vividly, and
---
through the slow hours of
 shadow he tenderly regarded her image now.
---
they possibly did
 with Oak to- night, for the delight of merely seeing her
 effaced for the time his perception of the great differ-
 ence between seeing and possessing.
  
---
He also thought of Plans for fetching his few utensils
 and books from Norcombe.
---
The Farrier's Sure Guide, The Veterinary
 Surgeon, Paradise Lost, The Pilgrim's Progress, Robinson
 Crusoe, Ash's Dictionary, the Walkingame's Arithmetic,
 constituted his library; and
---
from which he had acquired more sound informa-
 tion by diligent perusal than many a man of opportunities

---
By daylight, the Bower of Oak's new- found mistress,
 Bathsheba Everdene, presented itself as a hoary build-
 ing, of the early stage of Classic Renaissance as regards
 its architecture, and
---
, the main staircase to which was of hard oak, the
 balusters, heavy as bed- posts, being turned and, the handrail as
 stout as a parapet- top, and the stairs themselves con-

---
he went.
  
---
Why did n't he
 stop at the gate?
---
" Why does n't Mrs. Coggan go to the door?"
---
" There-- Mrs. Coggan is going!.
  
---
said Mrs. Coggan, and
---
I
 am never up to my elbows, Miss, in making a pudding
 but either my nose must
 needs begin tickling, and I ca n't live without scratching
   A woman's dress being a part of her countenance,
 and any disorder in the one being of the same nature
 with a malformation or wound in the other
---
" said Mrs. Coggan,
 critically.
  
---
I ca n't see him
---
Mrs. Coggan went downstairs, and
---
the other men be inquir-
."
  
---
" Who is Mr. Boldwood?"
---
" How old is he?"
  
---
" Why should he inquire about Fanny?"
  
---
" Oh, because,,
 he took her and, and.
---
He's a very kind man
 that way, but Lord-- there!"
  
---
He's been courted by sixes and sevens
---
Jane
 Perkins worked at him for two months like a slave,
 and
---
the two Miss Taylors spent a year upon him,
 and but
---
he cost Farmer Ives's daughter nights of tears
 and twenty pounds' worth of new clothes;
---
A little boy came up at this moment and.
---
He always had a loosened tooth or
 a cut finger to show to particular friends, which he did
 with an air of being thereby elevated above the common
 herd of afflictionless humanity-- to which exhibition
 of congratulation as well as pity.
  
---
" said Master Coggan in a
 scanning measure.
  
---
He gave it to me for opening
 the gate."
  
---
" What did he say?
---
" He said" my little man?'"

---
and I said," To Miss Everdene's please," and he said,
"?"
---
" Cause he gave me the penny!"
  
---
" A man wanted to once.
---
And you would n't have
 him?"
  
---
" He was n't quite good enough for me."
  
---
And did you love
 him,
---
A crooked file of men was

---
that her men had all deposited themselves on
 a long form and a settle at the lower extremity
---
" Now, men." said Bathsheba,".
---
I have
 two matters to speak of
---
that I have formed a resolu-
 tion to have no bailiff at all, but
---
The men breathed an audible breath of amazement.
  
---
" I met Farmer Boldwood."
---
I went with him and two of his men, and, but we found nothing."
  
---
" Yes, ma'am, but he's not
---
He
 promised."
  
---
he'll be in directly
---
Henery Fray,, lifted his eyebrows and fingers to
 express amazement on a small scale.
  
---
to which point he had

---
Now-the next-- Andrew
 Randle, you are a new man
---
Now-the next-- Andrew
 Randle, you are a new man, I hear.' A's a stammering man,
---
they turned him away because the
 only time he ever did speak plain he said his soul was
 his own, and other iniquities, to the squire."
---
' a ca n't speak a common
 speech to save his life."
  
---
" Sit down,"
   Joseph Poorgrass, in the background twitched, and

---
his lips became dry with fear of some terrible conse-
 quences,.
  
---
as he saw
---
" For you or anybody, ma'am,"
 replied the young married man.
  
---
" True-- the man must live!"
---
" Yes, he'll stay, ma'am!
---
" Well, he can speak for himself
---
for he was as irrepressibly
 good- humoured under ghastly snubs as a parliamentary
 candidate on the hustings
---
" The new shepherd will want a man under him,"

---
" Oh-- he will.
---
Who can he have?
---
" Young Cain Ball is a very good lad."
---
Shepherd Oak do n't mind his youth?"
---
he added,
.
  
---
with his arms folded
---
said Gabriel.
  
---
" No, I do n't mind that."" How did Cain come by such a name?"
---
" Oh you see, mem, his pore mother,.'
---
twas Abel killed Cain, and
---
However, we soften it down as much as we
 can, and call him Cainey.
---
brought up by a very heathen father and mother, who
 never sent her to church or school, and
---
Mr. Fray here drew up his features to the mild degree
 of melancholy required when the persons involved in
 the given misfortune do not belong to your own family.
  
---
" Very well then, Cainey Ball to be under- shepherd

---
I mean
---
" Quite well, I thank you Miss Everdene."
---
said
 Shepard Oak from the doorpost.
---
If I do n't
---
" Gabriel was rather staggered by the remark-
 able coolness of her manner.
---
before whom he stood
---
that Oak and
 the handsome woman had ever
 been other than strangers
---
When, in the
 writings of the later poets, Jove and his family are found
 to have moved from their cramped quarters on the peak
 of Olympus into the wide sky above it, their words show
 a proportionate increase of arrogance and reserve.

---
" he said,"."
---
He then stamped with
 each foot severely, and
---
said William.

---
" I'll tell ye all particulars.
---
When I got to Caster,
 bridge Barracks
---
as is his nature to, and
---
Gabriel had listened with interest.
---
" I saw,"
 he said.

---
I Left Behind Me
---
Every looker- on's
 inside shook with the blows of the great drum to his
 deepest vitals, and
---
Fanny's young man was one of the
 regiment, and
---
Gabriel remained musing and.

---
for he
 was in doubt
---
The throw was the idea of a man conjoined with the
 execution of a woman.
---
Nothing was heard in reply to the signal but
 the gurgle and cluck of one of these invisible wheels--
 together with a few small sounds which a sad man
 would have called moans, and a happy man laughter--
 caused by the flapping of the waters against trifling
 objects in other parts of the stream.

---
" Is it Sergeant Troy?
---
there was a mannerin the man
 which is rarely a husband's.
---
" O, must I?-- it is,,
 Frank?"

---
The low though extensive hall,, was thronged with hot men who talked among
 each other in twos and threes,.
---
the speaker of the minute
 looking sideways into his auditor's face and
---
Something in the exact arch of her upper unbroken
 row of teeth, and to argue a point with a
 tall man, suggested.
---
The other man would then shake his head.

---
If everybody, this man included
---
He was a gentlemanly man, with full and
 distinctly outlined Roman features, the prominences
 of which glowed in the sun with a bronze- like richness
 of tone.
---
He was erect in attitude, and quiet in
 demeanour.
---
Apparently he had some time ago.  
---
that
 entrance to middle age at which a man's aspect naturally
 ceases; and
---
Thirty- five and
 fifty were his limits of variation
---
-- he might have been
 either, or anywhere between the two.

---
that married men of forty are usually
 ready and generous enough to fling passing glances at
 any specimen of moderate beauty they may discern by
 the way
---
that this unmoved person
 was not a married man
---
Men be such
 a terrible class of society
---
" But there was one man who had more sense than
 to waste his time upon me."
---
Do you know at all who he could be?"

---
"; besides,' tis no difference, since
 he took less notice of you than any of the rest.
---
if he'd taken more
---
" Why, there he is!"
---
That's Farmer Boldwood--

---
when he called
---
as he outstripped them
---
The farmer had
 never turned his head once, but
---
He's an interesting man
---
why he is so wrapt up and indifferent, and
 seemingly so far away from all he sees around him,"
" It is said-- but not known for certain-- that he met
 with some bitter disappointment when he was a young
 man and merry
---
it is simply his nature
---
" Simply his nature, miss-- nothing else
 in the world."

---
he has been served
 cruelly
---
Perhaps, after all, he has!
---
he has
---
O yes, miss, he has!

---
he must have
---
what's the
 matter with him
---
" Did you notice Mr. Boldwood's doings in church
 this morning
---
" His pew is exactly opposite yours,
---
" And you did not see his goings on!,"

---
What did he do?"
---
should he
---
he did n't
---
Rich and
 gentlemanly, what does he care?"

---
It is only for little Teddy Coggan.

---
this will be a pretty
 surprise for him.
---
It just suits itself to a chubby-
 faced child like him."
---
how he would wonder!
---
Boldwood's had begun.
---
that he might just as well follow suit with the
 rest, and
---
that the most dignified and
 valuable man in the parish should withhold his eyes,
 and
---
He would n't see any humour
 in it."

---
" No, I wo n't do that." He'd worry to death."
---
He's rather a naughty
 child sometimes."

---
" Yes-- that he is."

---
as men do
---
with off- hand serenity directed the missive to
 Boldwood.

---
Upon the mantel- shelf before him was
 a time- piece, surmounted by a spread eagle, and upon
 the eagle's wings
---
till the large red seal became as a blot of blood
 on the retina of his eye; and
---
as he ate and--
" MARRY ME
---
he
 still read in fancy the words thereon,
---
although they
 were too remote for his sight
---
Here, in the quiet of Boldwood's parlour,
,
 and lasting all the week, the letter and its dictum changed"
 their tenor from the thoughtlessness of their origin to
 a deep solemnity, imbibed from their accessories
 now.

---
Since the receipt of the missive in the morning,
 Boldwood had felt the symmetry of his existence to
.
---
And such an explanation did not
 strike him as a possibility even.
---
When Boldwood went to bed
---
he placed the valen-
 tine in the corner of the looking- glass.
---
He was
 conscious of its presence,.
---
even when his back was
 turned upon it
---
It was the first time in Boldwood's
 life that such an event had occurred.
---
him to think it an act which had

---
a deliberate motive prevented him from regarding it as
 an impertinence
---
He looked again at the direction.

---
Somebody's
 some woman's-- hand had travelled softly over the
 paper bearing his name
---
Whenever Boldwood dozed
---
when he awoke there

---
His window admitted only a
 reflection of its rays, and
---
The substance of the epistle had occupied him but
 little in comparison with the fact of its arrival.
---
He
 suddenly wondered.
---
if anything more might be found in
 the envelope than what he had withdrawn
---
He jumped
 out of bed in the weird light,.

---
Boldwood looked,: "
---
as he
 had a hundred times the preceding day, at the insistent red
 seal
---
" he said aloud.

---
In doing
 so he caught sight of his reflected features, wan in
 expression, and insubstantial in form.
---
He saw.
---
that his eyes
 were wide- spread and vacant
---
Feeling uneasy and dis-
 satisfied with himself for this nervous excitability, he
 returned to bed.

---
The full power of the
 clear heaven was not equal to that of a cloudy sky at
 noon, when Boldwood arose and dressed himself.
---
He
 descended the stairs and.

---
over which he paused and

---
Boldwood was listlessly noting
---
Boldwood turned back into the road.
---
Boldwood seized it and
---
" I do n't think."
---
said the man
---
, when
 he saw Boldwood's action.
---
" I think."

---
Boldwood looked then at the address--

---
I opened
 it in mistake
---
The
 tall form was that of Gabriel Oak; the small one that
 of George
---
" Wait," said Boldwood.
---
" That's the man on the hill.

---
I'll take the letter to him myself."

---
To Boldwood it was now no longer merely a letter to

---
Exhibiting a
 face pregnant with intention, he entered the snowy field.

---
Gabriel, at that minute, descended the hill towards
 the right.
---
He had been without
 them for so many years that toothlessness was felt less
 to be a defect than hard gums an acquisition.
---
Indeed,
 he seemed.

---
as he got nearer
---
if he would ever reach it at all
---
" I say.".
---
, says I
---
, introductory matter being often
 omitted in this neighbourhood, both from word and
 deed, and the maltster having the same latitude allowed
 him, did not hurry.
---
He picked up a fragment
 of cheese, by pecking upon it with his knife, as a butcher
.

---
Henery appeared in a drab kerseymere great- coat,
 buttoned over his smock- frock, the white skirts of the
 latter being visible to the distance of about a foot below
 the coat- tails, which, when you got used to the style of
 dress, looked natural enough, and even ornamental--
---
Matthew Moon, Joseph Poorgrass, and other carters
 and waggoners followed at his heels, with great lanterns
 dangling from their hands, which showed that they had
 just come from the cart- horse stables, where they had
 been busily engaged since four o'clock that morning.

---
Henery shook his head, and.

---
he said".
---
Benjy
 Pennyways were not a true man or an honest baily--
 as big a betrayer as Judas Iscariot himself
---
He allowed his head to swing
 laterally three or four times in silence."
---
Henery meanwhile
 retained several marks of despair upon his face, to
.

---
he should go on speaking
---
Dear, dear, when I think o' it,
 I sorrows like a man in travel!"
" True, Henery I've heard ye."
---
said Joseph
 Poorgrass in a voice of thorough attestation, and with
 a wire- drawn smile of misery.

---
' Twould do a martel man no harm.
---
" to have" said Billy Smallbury, who had just
 entered, bearing his one tooth before him.
---
" attested
 Joseph Poorgrass.

---
her old uncle's things were not good
 enough for her
---
Mr.
 Oak appeared in the entry with a steaming face, a
 leather strap round his waist outside the smock- frock,
 and.
---
, hay-
 bands wound about his ankles
---
Four lambs hung in various embarrassing
 attitudes over his shoulders, and
---
Gabriel had contrived
---
" Well, Shepherd Oak, and how's lambing this year,
 if I mid say it?
---
" inquired Joseph Poorgrass.

---
" Terrible trying," said Oak.
---
" I've been wet through
 twice a- day, either in snow or rain, this last fortnight.

---
Cainy and I have n't tined our eyes to- night."

---
" A good few twins, too, I hear?
---
Joseph remarked.

---
said Gabriel," and.
---
I'll follow you soon."

---
as he was
---
Oak lowered
 the lambs from their unnatural elevation,.

---
as I used
---
" to have at
 Norcombe" said Gabriel," and' tis such a plague to bring
 the weakly ones to a house.
---
If' twasn't for your place
 here, malter, I do n't know!
---
what I should do
---
" Ay-- I understand.
---
"
" Sit down, Shepherd Oak," continued the ancient man
 of malt."
---
I should like; but faith, I should n't" know a soul
 there now.
---
" I suppose.'
---
These middle- aged men have been pulling her over
 the coals for pride and vanity.
---
The gallant Mark Clark here made a peculiar and well
 known sound with his own.

---
I say,. should n't I like!"
" Mark." said Gabriel,
---
as I've got no chance" I suppose?" said
 Oak,.

---
what I say
---
said Joseph."
---
Gabriel, though one of the quietest and most gentle
 men on earth, rose to the occasion, with martial
 promptness and vigour.
---
Here he
 placed his fist, rather smaller in size than a common
 loaf, in the mathemarical centre of the maltster's little
 table, and with."
---
before he went further
---
Now-- the
 first man in the parish that I hear prophesying bad of
 our mistress,"( here the fist was raised and
---
as T'hor might have done with his hammer in assaying
 it
---
why let fall
)--" he'll smell and-- or
---
though he understood English
 but
---
"" said Joseph Poorgrass with
 considerable anxiety from behind the maltster's bed-

---
he had retired for safety
---
' Tis a great
 thing to be clever, I'm sure."
---
he added,;
?"

---
" said Matthew Moon, with
 a small anxious laugh towards Oak,.

---
he was likewise
---
I'm clever?" said Oak.
"'
---
said Gabriel, as a
 man of medium sentiments on the subject.

---
Joseph Poorgrass used
---
" Yes, I can do a little that way."' a
 could never mind which way to turn the J's and E's
 -- could ye, Joseph?"
---
Joseph shook his head."
---
that he could n't

Matthew marked on the dusty floor with his
 whip- handle.

---
would n't he,
---
Joseph, when' a seed his name
 looking so inside- out- like?" continued Matthew Moon
 with feeling.

---
said Joseph, meekly."
---
But I was n't so much to blame, for them J's and E's be
 such trying sons o' witches for the memory to mind
 whether they face backward or forward; and
---
I always
 had such a forgetful memory, too."

---
I feel my thanks.
---
As to
 shepherd, there, I'm sure mis'ess ought to have made
 ye her baily-- such a fitting man for't as you be."

---
I do n't mind."
---
that I expected it
---
" owning said Oak,
 frankly."
---
Indeed, I hoped for the place.
---
Oak drew a slow breath,.

---
Their noise increased to a
 chorus of baas, upon which Oak pulled the milk- can from
 before the fire, and
---
I hear.

---
?" resumed Joseph Poorgrass, sary melancholy
---
his
 eyes lingering on the operations of Oak with the neces-

---
" I do n't have them."
---
said Gabriel.

---
I think
---
"-- that
 I do.
---
" replied Gabriel, hastily, and
---
a
 sigh escaped him,.

---
Boldwood entered the malthouse,
 bestowing upon each a nod of a quality between friendli-
 ness and condescension.

---
" Ah! Oak, I thought."
---
he said.
---
" I
 met the mail- cart ten minutes ago, and
---
I believe.
---
" O yes-- not a bit of difference, Mr. Boldwood--
 not a bit." said Gabriel, readily.
---
He had not a corre-
 spondent on earth, nor
---
was there a possible letter coming
 to him whose contents the whole parish would not have
.

---
Oak stepped aside, and.
---
DEAR FRIEND,-- I do not know your name, but
---
I also return the money I owe you, which
 you will excuse my not keeping as a gift.
---
I am happy to say I am going to be married to
 the young man who has courted me for some time-- Sergeant
 Troy, of the11th Dragoon Guards, now quartered in this
 town.
---
I know
---
He would,, object to my having received
 anything except as a loan,.
 
---
" I should be much obliged to you.

---
ing you again for your kindness,
" I am, your sincere well- wisher,
" FANNY ROBIN."

---
said Gabriel
---
I know."

---
Boldwood read the letter and.

---
I see."

---
" What sort of a man is this Sergeant Troy?
---
" said
 Gabriel.

---
" H'm-- I'm afraid not one to build much hope upon
 in such a case as this."
---
though
 he's a clever fellow, and up to everything
---
Unfortunately for her boy, his best friends died;
 and
---
he got then a situation as second clerk at a lawyer's
 in Casterbridge.
---
He stayed there for some time, and

---
had he not indulged in the wild freak of
 enlisting
---
I have much doubt
---
The door was hurriedly burst open again, and in
 came running Cainy Ball out of breath, his mouth red
 and open, like the bell of a penny trumpet, from which
 he coughed with noisy vigour and great distension of face.

---
said Oak, sternly," why will you
 run so fast and lose your breath
---
I'm always telling
 you of it."

---
" Oh-- I-- a puff of mee breath-- went-- the-- wrong
 way, please, Mister Oak, and!"

---
" I've run."
---
said Oak,.
---
" You are
 a good boy to run and tell me, Cain, and you shall
 smell a large plum pudding some day as a treat.
---
But,
, Cainy, bring the tarpot, and
---
Oak took from his illimitable pockets a marking iron,
--" B. E.." which signified to all the region
 round.

---
he delighted to
 muse on
---
" Now, Cainy, shoulder your two, and off Good
 morning, Mr. Boldwood.
---
" The shepherd lifted the
 sixteen large legs and four small bodies he had himself
.

---
Boldwood followed him a little way up the field,
 hesitated, and turned back.
---
He followed him again
 with a last resolve,.
---
On approaching
 the nook, the farmer
 drew out- his pocket- book, unfastened- it, and.
---
it
 to lie open on his hand
---
" I was going."
---
he said, with unreal
 carelessness,"?"

---
Oak glanced into the book, and."

---
Oak had coloured simply at the consciousness of
.
---
He now felt a strangely distressing
 qualm from a new thought.
---
Boldwood mistook his confusion:  sensitive persons
 are always ready with their
---
he returned-- and

---
there was something incongruous in the serious earnest-
 ness with which he applied himself to an argument on
 a valentine."
---
it could
 not have been uttered with a more constrained and
 restless countenance than was Boldwood's then."

---
having so far exposed his mood
 by those fevered questions to a stranger
---
He again
 placed the letter on the mantelpiece, and think of the circumstances attending it by the light of
 Gabriel's information.





---
A young
 cavalry soldier in a red uniform, with the three chevrons
 of a sergeant upon his sleeve, strode up the aisle, with
 an embarrassment which was only the more marked
 by the intense vigour of his step, and by the deter-
 mination upon his face to show none.
---
A slight flush
 had mounted his cheek by the time he had run the
 gauntlet between these women; but,
---
passing on through
 the chancel arch, he never paused.
---
till he came close
 to the altar railing
---
Here for a moment he stood
 alone.

---
who had not yet doffed his
 surplice
---
He whispered to the soldier,
 and
---
who in his turn
 whispered to an elderly woman, apparently his wife, and

---
He faced the south-
 east, and.

---
as he was still
---
" I wonder!"
---
There he stood, his face to
 the south- east, upright as a column, his cap in his hand.

---
he appeared.
---
At last he did turn, and

---
The young man on leaving
 the door went.
---
when, in the middle,
 he met a little woman
---
The expression of her face,
, sank at the
 sight of his nearly to terror.

---
" Well?" he said, in a suppressed passion, fixedly
.
"
---
I made a mistake!
---
-- I thought, and
---
I was at the
 door at half- past eleven to a minute.

---
and he gave vent to a hoarse laugh.

---
" he said, with a light
 irony, and.




 CHAPTER XVII



 IN THE MARKET- PLACE



---
Saturday Boldwood was in Casterbridge market
 house as usual,.
---
when the disturber of his dreams entered
 and
---
Adam had awakened from
 his deep sleep, and behold!
---
Boldwood looked at her-- not slily, critically, or
 understandingly, but blankly at gaze, in the way a
 reaper looks up at a passing train-- as something foreign
 to his element, and but.
---
that whether
 their orbits were as geometrical, unchangeable, and
 as subject to laws as his own, or as absolutely erratic
 as they superficially appeared
---
, he had not deemed it
.

---
his duty to consider
---
He saw her black hair, her correct facial curves
 and profile, and the roundness of her chin and throat.

---
He saw then the side of her eyelids, eyes, and lashes,
 and the shape of her ear.
---
Next he noticed her figure,
 her skirt, and the very soles of her shoes.

---
Boldwood thought her beautiful, but.
---
whether he was right in his thought
---
, for it seemed
 impossible that this romance in the flesh, if so sweet
 as he imagined, could have been going on long without
 creating a commotion of delight among men, and pro-
 voking more inquiry than Bathsheba had done, even
 though that was not a little
---
To the best of his judge-
 ment neither nature nor art could improve this perfect
 one of an imperfect many.
---
His heart began.
---
though
 forty years of age, had never before inspected a woman
 with the very centre and force of his glance; they had
 struck upon all his senses at wide angles.

---
He could not assure
 himself.
---
that his opinion was true even now
---
He fur-
 tively said to a neighbour,"?"

---
A man is never more credulous than in receiving
 favourable opinions on the beauty of a woman he is
 half, or quite, in love with
---
Boldwood was
 satisfied now.

---
Boldwood's blindness to the difference
 between approving of, and
 originating, was.

---
ently as if his face had been the pages of a ledger
---
But Boldwood grew
 hot down to his hands with an incipient jealousy
---
His first impulse was.
---
Boldwood renounced the idea.
---
He could not make
 the request
---
His
 eyes were following her everywhere.
---
if
 he thought
---
if he
 thought
---
him to woo her
---
REGRET


 BOLDWOOD was tenant of what was called Little
 Weatherbury Farm, and
---
his person was the nearest ap-
 proach to aristocracy that this remoter quarter of the
 parish could boast of.
---
only Mr. Boldwood going out for the day
---
His house stood, and
---
Pacing up and down at the heels of the animals was
 Farmer Boldwood himself.
---
This place was his almonry
 and cloister in one:  here, after looking to the feeding
 of his four- footed dependants
---
His square- framed perpendicularity showed more fully
 now than in the crowd and bustle of the market- house.

---
In this meditative walk his foot met the floor with heel
 and toe simultaneously, and
---
his fine reddish- fleshed face
 was bent downwards just enough to render obscure the
 still mouth and the well- rounded though rather prominent
 and broad chin.
---
A few clear and thread- like horizontal
 lines were the only interruption to the otherwise smooth
 surface of his large forehead.

---
The phases of Boldwood's life were ordinary enough,
 but
---
his was not an ordinary nature.
---
which struck casual observers more than anything else
 in his character and habit, and
---
His equilibrium disturbed
---
,
 he was in extremity at once.
---
If an emotion possessed
 him at all
---
, it ruled him
---
; a feeling not mastering him
 was entirely latent.
---
He was always hit mortally, or
---
he was missed.

---
He had no light and careless touches in his constitu-
 tion, either for good or for evil.
---
Stern in the outlines of
 action, mild in the details, he was serious throughout all.

---
He saw no absurd sides to the follies of life, and thus,
 though not quite companionable in the eyes of merry
 men and scoffers, and those to whom all things show
 life as a jest, he was not intolerable to the earnest and

---
if he failed to please

---
Being a man all the dramas of life seriously,, there was no frivolous treat-
 ment to reproach him for when they chanced to end
 tragically.

---
what
 Boldwood was
---
, he had never
 been seen at the high tides which caused them.

---
Farmer Boldwood came to the stable- door and.
---
Boldwood, looking into the distant meadows, saw
 there three figures.
---
it lighted him up.
---
A man's body is as the shell; or the tablet, of
 his soul, as he is reserved or ingenuous, overflowing or
 self- contained.
---
There was a  change in Boldwood's
 exterior from its former impassibleness; and
---
his face
 showed.

---
that he was now living outside his defences
 for the first time, and with a fearful sense of exposure
---
At last he arrived at a conclusion.
---
The insulation of his heart by reserve during these
 many years, without a channel of any kind for disposable
 emotion, had worked its effect.
---
Boldwood was a living testimony to
 the truth of the proposition.
---
He became.

---
He approached the gate of the meadow.
---
Gabriel
 had skinned the dead lamb, and.

---
Gabriel,
, was ever regardful of its faintest changes, and
 instantly discerned thereon the mark of some influence
 from without, in the form of a keenly self- conscious
 reddening.
---
He also turned and beheld Boldwood.

---
At onee connecting these signs with the letter Bold-
 wood had shown him, Gabriel suspected her of some
 coquettish procedure begun by that means, and
---
since, he knew not how.

---
Farmer Boldwood had read the pantomime denoting
 that they were aware of his presence, and the perception
 was as too much light turned upon his new sensibility.

---
He was still in the road, and
---
by moving on he hoped
.
---
that he had originally
 intended
---
He passed by with an
 utter and overwhelming sensation of ignorance, shyness,
 and doubt.
---
Perhaps in her manner there were signs
 that she wished to see him--.
---
perhaps not-- he could not
 read a woman
---
not one had ever been pondered by him
 until now.

---
THE OFFER


 BOLDWOOD did eventually call upon her.
---
" he murmured.
---
In con-
 templating Bathsheba as a woman, he had forgotten the
 accidents of her position as an agriculturist--
---
that being
 as much of a farmer, and as extensive a farmer, as
 himself
---
Boldwood was guilty of.
---
there was hardly awakened a thought in
 Boldwood that sorry household realities appertained to
 her, or that she, like all others, had moments of
 commonplace, when to be least plainly seen was to be
 most prettily remembered.
---
Thus a mild sort of
 apotheosis took place in his fancy,.

---
He had by this time grown
---
used to being in
 love; the passion now startled him, and
---
less even when it
 tortured him more
---
he felt himself adequate to the
 situation.
---
he went off
.

---
Boldwood went
---
Shepherd Oak, Jan Coggan, Moon, Poor-
 grass, Cain Ball, and several others were assembled
 here,
---
The meek sheep
 were pushed into the pool by Coggan and Matthew
 Moon, who stood by the lower hatch,
---
immersed to their
 waists; then Gabriel,, thrust
 them under, with an instrument
 like a crutch, formed for the purpose, and also for
 assisting the exhausted animals when the wool became
 saturated and.
---
Cainy Ball and Joseph,
, were if possible
 wetter than the rest
---
Boldwood came close and
---
he had

---
Boldwood seemed determined, and.
---
His tone was
---
Boldwood told everything in
 that word.

---
he said, with a
 solemn simplicity
---
I have come with-
 out preface.
---
since I have you clearly
---
I come."

---
" I am now forty- one years old."
---
he went on.
---
" I may
 have been called a confirmed bachelor, and
---
I was a
 confirmed bachelor.
---
I had never any views of myself
 as a husband in my earlier days, nor
---
have I made any
 calculation on the subject.

---
since I have been older
---
I have felt lately, more and more,
.

---
Beyond all things, I want you as my wife."

---
" I feel, Mr. Boldwood,."
---
though I respect you
 much
---
that, I do not feel--
---
that Boldwood had
---
" he exclaimed, in
 a low voice."
---
I want you--
---
I want
---
I love you again and again!"

---
why he thought
---
that,
 far from being a conceited assumption on Boldwood's
 part, it was but the natural conclusion of serious reflec-
 tion based on deceptive premises of her own offering
---
if you can not bear with me as a husband
---
than would many a man of your own
 age
---
The dairy superintendence shall be done by
 a man
---
; to the
 chaise, my poor father and mother
 drove, but
---
it swelled with
 sympathy for the deep- natured man who spoke so
 simply.
  
---
he said earnestly and
 gratefully.
---
" I am happier now."

---
" No-- I beg you!
---
I must think.
---
"
" I will wait.
---
" he said.

---
Boldwood dropped his
 gaze to the ground, and.
---
where he was
---
Realities then returned upon him
 like the pain of a wound received in an excitement
 which eclipses it, and
---
he, too, then went on.





---
" HE is so disinterested and kind to offer me all that I
 can desire."
---
Yet Farmer Boldwood, whether by nature kind or
 the reverse to kind, did not exercise kindness, here.

---
He was close
 to her doors
---
: his standing was sufficient
---
: his qualities
 were even supererogatory.
---
Boldwood as
 a means to marriage was unexceptionable
---
that ordinary men take wives, and
---
Cainy Ball turned the handle of Gabriel's grindstone,
.
---
his head performing
---
Oak stood somewhat, and
---
when in the act of sharpening his
 arrows: his figure slightly bent, the weight of his body
 thrown over on the shears
---
his head balanced side-
 ways, with a critical compression of the lips and contrac-
 tion of the eyelids to crown the attitude.

---
His mistress came up and
---
" Cain, go to the lower mead and.

---
Cain departed, and
---
Gabriel had glanced up in intense surprise,.
---
Gabriel applied the shears.

---
Gabriel turned.
---
if the men made any observa-
 tions on my going behind the sedge with Mr. Boldwood
 yesterday
---
" said Gabriel.
---
", miss-- I knew."

---
He relinquished the winch, and
---
times slap a child's hand in teaching him to write),
."
---
Incline the edge so,"
 he said.
  
---
Hands and shears were inclined to suit the words,
 and held thus for a peculiarly long time by the in-
 structor as he spoke.
  
---
I wo n't have!
---
Gabriel freed her hands quietly,
---
" Did the men think it odd?
---
"
" That Farmer Boldwood's name and your own
 were likely to be flung over pulpit together."

---
Gabriel looked incredulous and sad, but between
 his moments of incredulity, relieved.

---
if Mr. Boldwood really spoke of
 marriage
---
he
 did n't to please you
---
his tone being ambiguous
---
said Gabriel
 bitterly, and
---
going on
 with his turning, his words rising and,, perpendicularly into the earth, or horizontally
 along the garden.
  
---
as he stooped or
---
, his eyes being fixed on a leaf upon
 the ground
---
And the outspoken honesty of his character
 was such-
---
that on any subject even that of her love
 for, or marriage with, another man, the same disinter-
 estedness of opinion might be calculated on, and.
---
Thoroughly convinced of the
 impossibility of his own suit, a high resolve constrained
.
---
him not to injure that of another
---
he would reply truly
---
Gabriel did
---
on that account Gabriel had

---
He said nothing.

---
" I may ask,
---
I suppose,
---
for I said it honestly
 and with every serious meaning" I see. In my not marrying you, perhaps!
" Not by any means." said Gabriel quietly.
---
Whatever Gabriel felt
---
, he coolly echoed her words--
" Or."
  
---
Gabriel pro-
 tested
---
that he was loving her at the same time
---
He had not finished, either.
---
He
 continued in a more agitated voice:--
" My opinion is( since you ask it) that you are
 greatly.
---
Leading on a
 man is not a praiseworthy action.

---
if you seriously inclined
 towards him
---
him find it out in

---
" Very well." said Gabriel calmly.
---
He had
 been held to her by a beautiful thread which it pained
 him to spoil by breaking, rather than by a chain he
 could not break.
---
I should be even better pleased to
.
---
" go at once" he added.

---
And he took his shears and.





---
" Sixty!" said Joseph Poorgrass.

---
" Fifty- nine!" said Susan Tall's husband.

---
"-- Clover!" said Joseph Poorgrass.

---
" said Joseph.

---
Joseph's countenance was drawn into lines and
 puckers by his concern.
---
his face were rigid.
---
his eyes turned whichever way.
  
---
" Yes." said Joseph," and
---
I was sitting at home,
, and."
---
," he said,"
---
All the ancient men ran in a jumbled throng after
 her to the clover- field,.

---
Joseph sinking down in the
 midst when about half- way, like an individual withering
 in a world which was more and more insupportable
---
O, what can I do
---
", what can I do!"
---
Only one man in the neighbourhood knows the way
---
","
 said Joseph,
---
He could cure'em
."

---
all if he were here
---
" Who is he?
---
" Shepherd Oak," said Matthew.
---
" Ah, he's a clever
 man in talents!"

---
" Ah, that he is so!
---
" said Joseph Poorgrass.

---
" True-- he's the man.
---
" How dare you name that man in my presence!"
---
ing," Farmer Boldwood knows!"
  
---
" Two of his store
 ewes got into some vetches t'other day, and.
---
He sent a man on horseback here post- haste
 for Gable, and
---
" Never will I send for him never!"" Where is Oak staying?"

---
he
 must return instantly--
---
He diminished down the
 hill.

---
to which
 Gabriel had retired before taking his final departure
 from the locality
---
The men entered the field and
.
---
Tall had had presence of
 mind enough to give the mare up to Gabriel, and
---
Gabriel was not visible anywhere.

---
" Perhaps he is already gone!"
---
" He says."
---
Joseph
 Poorgrass retired a few steps behind a hurdle.

---
" He says."

---
he shall not come
---
" Oh, oh, that's his answer!
---
Where does he get his
 airs?
---
The men looked grave,.

---
Who am I, then,? I beg to a man who has begged to me?"
 I would n't cry about it I'm sure he'd come then. Gable is a true man in that
 way."

---
And he drives me!
---
what;
 yes, he does
---
Gabriel
 was not angry
---
: he was simply neutral,.
---
Gabriel looked at her.

---
Such a tenderly- shaped reproach for his previous
 delay was the one speech in the language that he could
 pardon for not being commendation of his readiness
 now.

---
Gabriel murmured a confused reply, and.
---
Gabriel was already among the turgid, prostrate forms.

---
He had flung off his coat,.

---
Gabriel began.

---
Passing his hand over the sheep's left flank, and
 selecting the proper point, he punctured the skin and
 rumen with the lance
---
; then he
 suddenly withdrew the lance,.
---
Owing to the great hurry
,
 Gabriel missed his aim in one case, and
---
When the love- led man had ceased from his labours
---
" said Gabriel.

---
Gabriel lately, for the first time since
 his prostration by misfortune, had been independent in
 thought and vigorous in action to a marked extent--
 conditions which, powerless without an opportunity as
.
---
But this incurable
 loitering beside Bathsheba Everdene stole his time
 ruinously.
---
The spring tides were going by without
 floating him off, and
---
Flossy catkins of the later kinds, fern- sprouts
 like bishops' croziers, the square- headed moschatel, the
 odd cuckoo- pint,-- like an apoplectic saint in a niche
 of malachite,-- snow- white ladies'-smocks, the toothwort,
 approximating to human flesh, the enchanter's night-
 shade, and the black- petaled doleful- bells, were among
 the quainter objects of the vegetable world in and about
 Weatherbury at this teeming time; and of the animal,
 the metamorphosed figures of Mr. Jan Coggan, the
 master- shearer; the second and third shearers, who
 travelled in the exercise of their calling, and do not re-
 quire definition by name; Henery Fray the fourth
 shearer, Susan Tall's husband the fifth, Joseph Poorgrass
 the sixth, young Cain Ball as assistant- shearer, and
 Gabriel Oak as general supervisor.
---
which was
 the wood threshing- floor in the centre, formed of thick
 oak, black with age and polished by the beating of flails
 for many generations
---
these to bristle with a
 thousand rays strong enough to blind a weak- eyed man
---
; his old times are still
 new
---
; his present is futurity.

---
They were indifferently well assisted
 by the old maltster, who, when the malting season from
 October to April had passed, made himself useful upon
 any of the bordering farmsteads.

---
Gabriel, hovered under her
 bright eyes like a moth, did not shear continuously,
.
---
half his time being spent in attending to the others
 and
---
he was
---
who
 had allowed his last finished sheep to go off among
 the flock
---
as he put down the luncheon to drag
 a frightened ewe to his shear- station,
---
He lopped off the tresses about its head, and
---
his mistress quietly looking
 on:
"
---
Poor Gabriel's soul was fed with a luxury of content
 by having her over him,.
---
her eyes critically regarding
 his skilful shears, which apparently were going to gather
 up a piece of the flesh at every close, and yet never did
 so
---
Like Guildenstern, Oak was happy.
---
in that he was
 not over happy
---
He had no wish to converse with her:
 that his bright lady and himself formed one group,
 exclusively their own, and containing no others in the
 world
---
that was
 Gabriel's
---
Full of this dim and temperate bliss, he
 went on.

---
" said Gabriel,
---
" Yes, Mister Oak; here I be!"

---
Cainy now runs forward with the tar- pot."
---
But heartless circumstance could not leave entire
 Gabriel's happiness of this morning.
---
the men were proceeding with the shear-
 lings and hogs,.

---
when Oak's belief stand pleasantly by and time him through another
 performance was painfully interrupted by Farmer Bold-
 wood's appearance in the extremest corner of the barn
---
there
 he certainly was.
---
Boldwood always carried with him a
 social atmosphere of his own, which everybody felt who
 came near him; and
---
He crossed over towards Bathsheba, who turned to
 greet him with a carriage of perfect ease.
---
He spoke to
 her in low tones, and
---
her voice ultimately even
 caught the inflection of his.
---
was not audible to
 Gabriel, who was too independent to get near, though
 too concerned to disregard.
---
Gabriel theorized, not without
 truth,.

---
Gabriel sheared on,.

---
he walked up and
 down alone for nearly a quarter of an hour.
---
Bob Coggan led-on-her mare,.
  
---
Boldwood fetching his
 own horse from the tree under which it had been tied
---
Oak's eyes could not forsake them; and
---
that he watched Boldwood's manner
---
in en-
 deavouring to continue his shearing at the same time
, he snipped the
 sheep in the groin.
---
to Oak,, it had a sting which the abiding
 sense of his inferiority to both herself and Boldwood was
 not calculated to heal.
---
that he had no longer a lover's interest in her
---
he shouted, in an unmoved voice of routine.

---
Cainy Ball ran up,
---
Boldwood gently tossed Bathsheba into the saddle,
 and
---
" I am going now.

---
Boldwood's deep attachment was a matter of great
 interest among all around him; but,.

---
after having been
 pointed out for so many years as the perfect exemplar
 of thriving bachelorship, his lapse was an anticlimax
 somewhat resembling that of St. John Long's death by
 consumption in the midst of his proofs that it was not
 a fatal disease
---
" I reckon." said Coggan, working
 along without looking up.

---
he and she
 should trouble two houses
---
neighbours, what a man I be,
 and how I come down with my powerful words", we do, Henery."

---
there's gifted men willing
---
Farmer Boldwood kissed her behind the spear- bed at the
 sheep- washing t'other day--
---
I did n't put it so plain that she could
 understand my meaning, so I could lay it on all the
 stronger. I believe
 that I do."
" What a lie!" said Gabriel.

---
" Ah, neighbour Oak--?" said, Henery,
 mildly.
"
---
said Oak, with
 a pharisaical sense.

---
that he was not as other shearers in
 this matter
---
At the same time ye be no old
 man worth naming-- no old man at all.
---
what's a old  man's standing

---
if se be his teeth
---
ye to be a wonderful veteran man
---
" Nobody." said Joseph Poorgrass.
---
" Ay, and as a young man, when my senses were in
 prosperity, I was likewise liked by a good- few who
 knowed me." said the maltster.

---
The bent and hoary' man was satisfied, and
---
who, what with her
 brown complexion, and the working wrapper of rusty
 linsey, had at present the mellow hue of an old sketch
 in oils-- notably some of Nicholas Poussin's:--
" Do anybody know of a crooked man, or a lame, or
 any second- hand fellow at all that would do for poor
 me
---
Coggan furnished a suitable reply.
---
Oak went on
 with his shearing, and.
---
He did not covet the post
 relatively to the farm:  in relation to herself, as beloved
 by him and unmarried to another
---
, he had coveted it.

---
His readings of her seemed now.
---
His lecture to her was one of
 the absurdest mistakes.
---
, he thought,
---
He was inwardly
 convinced that, in accordance with the anticipations of
 his easy- going and worse- educated comrades, that day
 would see Boldwood the accepted husband of Miss
 Everdene.
---
Gabriel at this time of his life had out-

---
which every Christian
 boy has for reading the Bible,
---
he inwardly said,"!"
---
I find more bitter
 than death the woman whose heart is snares and
 nets
---
He adored Bathsheba just the same.

---
said Cainy Ball,.
---
This morning I see'em--
---
And there was a great black crock upon the brandish
 with his legs a- sticking out, but
---
I do n't know."

---
said Joseph
 Poorgrass, in a pleasant, masticating manner of anticipa-
 tion.
---
At this moment Mr. Boldwood came in at the gate,
 and.

---
He apologized for his lateness: 
---
his arrival was evidently
 by arrangement.

---
" Gabriel." said she"

---
Mr. Boldwood come there
---
Oak moved in silence back to his original seat.

---
Inwardy, too, he
 was blithe, and consequently chatty to an exceptional
 degree.
---
that he had come,

---
though the uninvited presence of Pennyways, the bailiff
, disturbed her equan-
 imity for a while
---
, Coggan began on his own
 private account, without reference to listeners: --

---
I've lost my love, and
---
l care not;
 I shall soon have another

---
I've lost my love, and
---
I care not.

---
" Now, Master Poorgrass, your song!" said Coggan.

---
" I be all but in liquor, and.

---
said Joseph,
---
" said Coggan,."
---
well, I must suffer it!...
---
said Coggan.

---
" I always tries."
---
said Joseph, differently;
.
---
" Well, really, ma'am." he replied, in a yielding tone,
".
---
I do n't know
---
Poorgrass, thus assured,,.
---
This was so successful
 that he rashly plunged into a second in the same
 breath, after a few false starts: --

---
said Coggan, at the end of the
 verse.
---
Though" love" is
 a nasty high corner when a man's voice is getting
 crazed.
---
But during this rendering young Bob Coggan ex-
 hibited one of those anomalies:  in
 trying to check his laughter, he pushed down his throat
 as much of the tablecloth as he could get hold of, when,
 after continuing hermetically sealed for a short time, his
 mirth burst out through his nose.
---
Joseph perceived it,
 and
---
Coggan boxed Bob's ears immediately.

---
" Go on, Joseph-- go on, and."
---
never mind the young
 scamp said Coggan.
---
Now then again-- the next bar; I'll help ye to flourish
 up the shrill notes where yer wind is rather wheezy: --

---
Bob
 Coggan was sent home for his ill manners, and
---
tran-
 quility was restored by Jacob Smallbury, who volunteered
 a ballad as inclusive and interminable as that with which
 the worthy toper old Silenus amused on a similar occasion
 the swains Chromis and Mnasylus, and other jolly dogs
 of his day.

---
Gabriel suddenly missed Farmer Boldwood from his
 place at the bottom of the table.
---
How long he had

---
he had apparently
 withdrawn into the encircling dusk.
---
their
 lively new flames shone down the table and over the
 men, and.

---
that Boldwood had gone inside the room, and

---
Boldwood had
 drawn up on her left, within the room.
---
Subsequent events caused, and
 even years, by more than one of those who were gathered
 there: --
 For his bride a soldier sought her,
 And a winning tongue had he:
 On the banks of Allan Water

---
In addition to the dulcet piping of Gabriel's flute,
 Boldwood supplied a bass in his customary profound
 voice,
---
uttering his notes so softly, however, as to abstain
 entirely from making anything like an ordinary duet of
 the song; they rather formed a rich unexplored shadow,
 which threw her tones into relief.
---
that Gabriel could
 not avoid
---
Yet there was nothing exceptional in
 his actions beyond what appertained to his time of
 performing them.
---
; he turned aside;
---
when praised he
 was silent; he murmured
 his thanks.
---
the necessity of being jealous,, did not lead Oak.

---
Boldwood thereupon closing the sash and the
 shutters, and
---
Oak wandered
 away under the quiet and scented trees.
---
, Coggan turning to
 Pennyways: --

---
as he pushed back the bench
---
" I like, and
---
the
 man deserves it
---
" he remarked,.

---
as if he were the masterpiece of some
 world- renowned artist
---
" I'm sure I should never have believed it if we had n't
 proved it, so to allude,
---
" hiccupped Joseph Poorgrass,".

---
" I'm sure I do n't deserve half the praise you give
 me."
---
whenever he do really make up his mind, as I could
 see by his face he
---
, he's
 generally able to carry it out.
---
he's
---
" Well, I'll say this for Pennyways." added Coggan,
" Yes, I'm proud to say.
 we thank ye for it,
 Pennyways."
---
" Well."--' tis an honest deed, and said Joseph; to which opinion the remainder
 of the company subscribed unanimously.
  
---
His body moved restlessly, and
---
But, Mr.
 Boldwood, hesitation on so high a matter is honourable
 in any woman, and
---
Boldwood withdrew with a serene smile.

---
; he had entirely
 bared his heart before her,.
---
even until he had almost
 worn in her eyes the sorry look of a grand bird without
 the feathers that make it grand
---
Gabriel had almost
 constantly preceded her in this tour every evening,
; but
---
this tender
 devotion was to a great extent unknown to his mistress,
 and.
---
said
 the man.

---
I'll open it, and
---
The man to whom she was hooked was brilliant in
 brass and scarlet.
---
He was a soldier.
---
His sudden
 appearance was to darkness.
---
that the military man's
 spur had become entangled in the gimp which decorated
 the skirt of her dress
---
He caught a view of her face.

---
" I'll unfasten you in one moment,."
---
he said,
 with new- born gallantry.

---
-- I can do it
---
He too stooped, and
---
He looked hard into her eyes
---
for his
 gaze was too strong to be received point- blank with her
 own
---
that he was young
 and slim, and
---
that he wore three chevrons upon his
 sleeve
---
" I am a man."
 I fancy so."", miss; it is no use blinking the
 matter."
---
he unwound a cord from the little
 wheel.
---
whether by
 accident or design, he touched it
---
His unravelling went on, but
---
he
 said.

---
I should have liked
---
"-- I wish--!"
---
" I deserve the chastisement your words give me.

---
Do but
 look; I never saw such a tangle!"

---
" Indeed, I do n't think so.
---
He added a
 sigh which had as much archness in it as a sigh could
 possess without losing its nature altogether.
---
he said,.

---
" I've seen a good many women in my time,
;" but

I am staying in
 this place.

so
 did he.

he said.

---
No, I say; but

though I have not

He was here once in that way when the
 regiment was at Casterbridge."

" He had."

" What kind of a person is he?"

I blush!

But
 I know.

him to be very quick and trim,

as he is

He's a doctor's son by name,
; and

he's an earl's son by

And, he was brought up so well, and.

while he was there

he got on so far that he could take down Chinese

However, he wasted his gifted lot,

It was a fatal omission of Boldwood's

CHAPTER XXV



 THE NEW ACQUAINTANCE DESCRIBED


 IDIOSYNCRASY and vicissitude had combined to
 stamp Sergeant Troy as an exceptional being.

---
He was a man to whom memories were an in-
 cumbrance, and anticipations a superfluity.
---
what was before his
 eyes
---
Simply
 feeling, considering, and caring for, he was vulnerable only in the present.
---
His out-
 look upon time was as a transient flash of the eye now
 and then: .
---
With him the past
 was yesterday; the future, to- morrow; never, the day
 after.

---
he might
---
Sergeant Troy, being entirely innocent of the
 practice of expectation, was never.
---
what Troy had

---
he did not miss
---
he enjoyed
---
He was moderately truthful towards men, but
---
He never passed the line which divides the spruce
 vices from the ugly; and
---
though his morals had

---
This treatment
 had led to his becoming a sort of regrater of other
 men's gallantries, to his own aggrandizement as a
 Corinthian, rather than to the moral profit of his
 hearers.

---
His reason and his propensities had seldom any
.
---
while his intentions were as honourable as could be

---
his virtuous phases of cool meditation, the latter
 had a modest tendency to be oftener heard of than
 seen.

---
Troy was full of activity, but
---
his activities were less of
 a locomotive than a vegetative nature; and,.
---
Hence, whilst he sometimes
 reached the brilliant in speech
---
, he fell below the commonplace in action,
 from inability to guide incipient effort.
---
He had a
 quick comprehension and considerable force of char-
 acter; but,
---
He was a fairly well- educated man for one of middle
 class-- exceptionally well educated for a common soldier.

---
He spoke fluently and unceasingly.
---
He could in this
 way be one thing and.

---
, he
 could speak of love and;
---
It is to the credit of
 men that few attempt to settle the question by experi-
 ment, and
---
Sergeant Troy was one.

---
He had been known.
---
you are a lost man.
---
that I do n't answer for," I believe so. what I did do to sulk away like that
 from a man who was only civil and kind" he would
 say.

---
This philosopher's public appearance in Weatherbury
 promptly followed his arrival there.
---
Coggan and Mark Clark were mowing
 in a less forward meadow
---
, Clark humming a tune to
 the strokes of his scythe, to which Jan made no attempt
 to keep time with his.
---
that he
 was doing the mistress of the farm real knight- service
 by this voluntary contribution of his labour at a busy
 time
---
As soon Troy saw her,
 and
---
sticking his pitchfork into the ground and picking
 up his crop or cane, he came forward.
---
" said the sergeant, touching his
 diminutive cap.
---
I heard), I say, I step across now to
. To be sure I am no stranger to the place--
 I am Sergeant Troy, as I told you, and I have assisted
 your uncle in these fields no end of times when I was a
 lad. I have been doing the same for you today." I suppose I must thank you for that, Sergeant
 Troy." said the Queen of the Corn- market, in an in-
 differently grateful tone.

---
" he said.
---
" I am glad it is not."

---
if I may ask without offence
---
" Because I do n't much want."

---
" I am afraid I have made a hole with my tongue
 that my heart will never mend.
---
that ill- luck should follow a man for honestly
 telling a woman she is beautiful
---
that I would rather have your room
 than your company
---
" And I would rather have curses from you than
 kisses from any other woman
---
; so I'll stay here.
---
he was
---
" Well." continued Troy," I suppose, and
---
Because a plain blunt man,, speaks out his
 mind without exactly intending it
---
, he's."

---
he said, carelessly."
---
But I have the sad satis-
 faction of knowing that my words, whether pleasing or
 offensive, are unmistakably true.
---
Not I. I could n't tell any such ridiculous lie about
 a beauty too excessive a modesty."

---
" Because I was n't going to.
---
I let out mine.
---
-- I should have exclaimed about it in the same
 way."

---
" Oh, ever since I was big enough to know loveliness
 from deformity."

---
" I wo n't speak of morals or religion-- my own or
 anybody else's.
---
Though perhaps I should have been a
 very good Christian."

---
Troy followed,.

---
The careless sergeant smiled
 within himself, and
---
he is content, and.
---
drown the bitterness of
 espised love in drink; twenty more will mope away
 their lives without a wish or attempt to make a mark in
 he world,.
---
Men are such constant
 fools!
---
But all these men will be
 saddened.
---
And not only those ninety- nine men, but
 the ninety- nine women are
 saddened with them.
---
The handsome sergeant's features were during this
 speech as rigid and stern as John Knox's in addressing
 his gay young queen.

---
Seeing, he said,"?"

---
" No; I began, but
---
when I got to the verbs
---
, father
 died."
---
--" He chastens."
---
said Troy,
 with much hearty conviction on the exterior of his face:
 and.
---
when a
 dozen men arfe ready to speak tenderly to you, and

---
as I may be
---
, I am not so

---
I think you-- are conceited, nevertheless
---
not because
 the nature of his cajolery was, but

---
You may think a man foolish to want a
 mere word--  just a good morning.
---
Perhaps he is--
---
But you have never been a man looking
 upon a woman, and that woman yourself."

---
The sergeant looked at his watch and.

---
he inquired.

---
what the young-- man was
 intending
---
" It is an unusually good one for a man like me to
 possess."
---
he quietly said.
---
till I came of age,
---
that ever I
 inherited
---
" But, Sergeant Troy, I can not take this
---
-- I can not!"

---
as he retired
---
" But indeed I ca n't have it!" You should
 not be so reckless, indeed, Sergeant Troy!"

---
which,
, he had praised in jest
---
Her beauty,,
 had in its animated phases moved him; and

---
though his seriousness was less than she imagined
---
, it
 was probably more than he imagined himself.

---
A factitious reply had been again upon his lips, but

---
he looked at her with an
 arrested eye.
---
that--  her alluring
 beauty bore out so fully the epithets he had bestowed
 upon it that he was quite startled at his temerity in
 advancing them as false
---
He said mechanically," Ah,
 why?" and.

---
" I did not quite mean.
---
" he broke out,
 bluntly;" but
---
, upon my soul, I wish.

---
I have reasons for reserve
 which I can not explain.
---
he said,;".
---
I must be leaving you now
---
" Indeed I will.
---
Yet, I do n't know!
---
if I will
---
" Perhaps in setting a gin, I have caught myself.

---
he coaxed.

---
" Yes, I suppose so; if it is any pleasure to you."

---
" Miss Everdene, I thank you.

---
The sergeant brought his hand to the cap on the
 slope of his head, saluted, and returned to the distant
 group of haymakers.

---
, what have I done!
---
I wish
---
I knew!





---
It was in the latter part of June, and the day after
 the interview with Troy in the hayfield, that Bathsheba
 was standing in her garden, watching a swarm in the
 air and guessing their probable settling place.
---
The men and women being all busily engaged in

---
Troy was just opening the garden gate.

---
the
 bottom Troy was there also, and
---
he stooped.

---
How fortunate I am
---
" Will I!" said Troy." Why, of course I will. How
 blooming you are to- day!"
---
Troy flung down his cane
 and.

---
He looked such an extraordinary object in this guise
.
---
It was the removal of yet another stake from
 the palisade of cold manners which had kept him off
.
---
whilst he was
 busy sweeping and shaking the bees from the tree
---
whilst his attention was absorbed in the operation to

---
He came down.

---
" Upon my life." said Troy, through the veil,".
---
" he approached her."
---
I am nearly stifled inside
 this silk cage.
---
" said Troy.

---
Men and boys peeped through chinks or over walls into the barrack-

---
Troy looked far away.
---
" to bring her" he said coldly.

---
than his coldness had

---
" Well, I wo n't bring Liddy-- and
---
I'll come.
---
said Troy.




 CHAPTER XXVIII




---
At eight o'clock this midsummer evening, whilst the
 bristling ball of gold in the west still swept the tips of

---
Troy stood
 in the bottom,.

---
" I heard."
---
before I saw
 you
---
he said,.

---
yielding half- buried within it.
" Now." said Troy,.
---
as he
 raised it into the sunlight
---
Troy's arm was still again."
---
He
 repeated them."
---
" he said.
---
"; though
 I do n't mind your twos and fours; but
---
I'll let you off the ones and threes.

---
Troy duly
 exhibited them."
---
He gave the movements as before.
---
Now I'll be more inter-
 esting, and.
---
that I shall miss you every time by one hair's breadth,
 or perhaps two
---
I'll be sure not to!"
---
He pointed to about a yard in front of him.

---
He flourished the sword by way of introduction
 number two, and
---
The third item
 of consciousness was that of seeing the same sword,
 perfectly clean and free from blood held vertically in
 Troy's hand( in the position technically called" recover
 swords").
---
said Troy, quietly.
---
I give my word that l will
 not only not hurt you, but
---
" I do n't think.
---
I am afraid
---
had there been more dexterity shown in its
 management than by the hands of Sergeant Troy, and

---
never had he been in such splendid temper for the
 performance as now in the evening sunshine among the
 ferns with Bathsheba.
---
It may safely be asserted with
 respect to the closeness of his cuts,.

---
spread in a
 scarlet haze over the space, like
 a twanged harpstring, and behind all Troy himself,
 mostly facing her sometimes, to show the rear cuts,
 half turned away and
---
his lips tightly
 closed in sustained effort.
---
Next, his movements lapsed
 slower, and
---
he stopped
 entirely.

---
" tidying, he
 said,."
---
I'll do
 it for you."

---
" Bravely borne!" said Troy.
---
because I did n't expect it
---
I am afraid of you
---
-- indeed I am!"
---
" I wo n't touch you at all-- not even your hair.
---
I
 am only going.

---
He touched the palm of his hand with the blade,
 and
---
And Troy returned the weapon to
 the scabbard.

---
said Troy, softly.
---
him stoop to the grass
---
which he had severed from her manifold tresses
---
He was altogether too
 much for her, and
---
" I must leave you now." He drew near and."

---
I must be leaving you
---
He drew nearer still.
---
his
 scarlet form disappear amid the ferny thicket, almost in
 a flash,
---
The circumstance had been the gentle dip of Troy's
 mouth downwards upon her own.
---
He had kissed her.




 CHAPTER XXIX




---
Troy's deformities lay deep down from a
 woman's vision,;
---
whilst his embellishments were upon
 the very surface
---
' reck'd not her own rede,"
 And thus contrasting with homely Oak,
 whose defects were patent to the blindest, and.

---
Gabriel saw, and
---
That he was not beloved had hitherto been his
 great that Bathsheba was getting into the toils
.
---
Oak determined.

---
He would base his appeal on what he considered her
 unfair treatment of Farmer Boldwood, now absent from
 home.

---
when Oak,, took the same path and
---
as he thought
---
Oak
 stood aside.

---
" Oh, is it Gabriel?"
---
to meet you," said Oak, turning and following at her heels.

---
I am not very fearful."

---
" I never meet them."

---
Now Oak, with marvellous ingenuity, had been going
."
---
But, it suddenly occurring to him.
---
He tried
 another preamble.
"
---
as the man to meet
 you is away from home
---
And, too-- I mean Farmer Boldwood
 
---
-- why, thinks I,.
---
I'll go
---
" he said.

---
" I do n't quite understand by saying
 that Mr. Boldwood would naturally come to meet me
---
I meant on account of the wedding which they say
 is likely to take place between you and him,.
---
Gabriel now put forth his unobscured opinion,."
---
" he
 said,"."

---
, I never in my life
 saw any courting
---
if his is not a courting of you
---
he has urged me.
---
as he returns
---
you were trifling with him,

---
Oak was unfortunately led on.
---
That I am, I suppose" Well, I hope."
 I do n't trifle with
 him; but then, I have nothing to do with him."
" I wish never met that young Sergeant Troy, miss." he sighed.


---
" He is not good enough for' ee."

---
" Then it appears to me that Sergeant Troy does not
 concern us here.
---
that Sergeant Troy is an educated man, and quite worthy
 of any woman
---
He is"

---
His being higher in learning and birth than the
 ruck
---
" o' soldiers is anything but a proof of his worth.
---
his course to be down'ard
---
Mr. Troy's course is not by any means downward;
 and
---
his superiority IS a proof of his worth!"

---
him to have no conscience at all
---
he's such a bad man
---
he is not
---
what he is
---
as if he MIGHT be bad
---
" he said,
 sturdily."
---
His cleverness in his calling may have

---
When he tries
---
him coming one way
---
When
 he says anything laughable." or" that
 Sergeant What's- his- name."
---
who will
 report your talk as" that fantastical man
---
I say--.
---
I say again--
---
that it does n't become you to
 talk about him
---
Why he should be mentioned passes
 me quite.
---
" I know this,
 th- th-!"

---
that he is a thoroughly conscientious man-- blunt
 sometimes even to rudeness-- but
---
" Oh."
" He is as good as anybody in this parish!
---
He is
 very particular, too, about going to church--
---
yes, he
 is!"

---
" I am afraid nobody saw him there.
---
I never
 did certainly."

---
that he goes
 in privately by the old tower door, just when the service
 commences, and sits at the back of the gallery
---
He
 told me so."

---
This supreme instance of Troy's goodness fell upon
 Gabriel ears like the thirteenth stroke of crazy clock.

---
Oak was.

---
He brimmed with deep feeling
---
as he replied in a steady
 voice
---
, the steadiness of which was spoilt by the palpable-
 ness of his great effort to keep it so: --
" You know, mistress, that I love you, and shall love
 you always.
---
I only mention this.
---
that at any rate I would wish
---
I put it aside
---
I have lost in the race for
 money and good things, and
---
I am not such a fool as to
 pretend to' ee now I am poor, and
---
"" he went on."
---
I am
 six years older than you, and
---
Mr. Boldwood is ten years
 older than I, and--
---
I do
---
beg of' ee to consider
-- how safe you would be in his
 hands!"

---
" I wish."
---
I do n't want you--
---
I beg you!"

---
said Oak, calmly.
---
I am mistress here."

---
that I ca n't go without putting things in such a strait as

---
I'll go at once if you'll
 promise that."

---
I shall have no bailiff
---
"; I shall continue.
---
a man say
---
what he would n't dream of
 at other times
---
that he might stay
---
if he wished
---
" said Gabriel, gently.

---
He wondered.
---
He stood still and.

---
till he could only see her
 form upon the sky
---
The shape beyond all doubt
 was Troy's.
---
Oak would not be even a possible listener,
 and
---
Gabriel went home by way of the churchyard.
---
he thought of what she had said about
 the sergeant's virtuous habit of entering the church un-

---
Believing to was quite disused, he
 ascended the external flight of steps at the top of which

---
It was a decisive proof that
 the door had not been opened at least since Troy came
 back to Weatherbury.





---
He had bidden her adieu for two
 days, which were so he stated, to be spent at Bath in
 visiting some friends.
---
He had also kissed her a second
 time.

---
that Troy's presentation of himself so aptly at
 the roadside this evening was not by any distinctly pre-
 concerted arrangement
---
He had hinted--
---
it was only on the chance of his still
 coming that she had dismissed Oak, fearing a meeting
 between them just then.

---
he had brought before her
 and
---
If he marry her
---
Well, I wish
---
I had half such a husband
---
" You admired him from your heart only this morning
 in the very world
---
He is a wild scamp
 now, and
---
you are right to hate him."

---
" He's NOT a wild scamp!
---
what he is
---
if
 any of you say a word against him
---
you cared for him
---
Of course a lady like Miss Everdene ca n't love him
---
that he's
 not a fast man
---
Solemnly swear to me; they say about him!"

---
he is not if-- 
---
But, Liddy, he CANNOT BE had,.
---
he is
---
him to be
---
" He is not had at all....
---
O, had never seen him!
---
" He is a sort of steady man in a wild way,.
 way.
---
because it will
 be dreadful for me, and no good to him,
---
you would be a match for any man
---
which this man of the woods had introduced
 into his wares
---
Boldwood
 was stepping on, not with that quiet tread of reserved
 strength which was his customary gait, in which he
 always seemed to be balancing two thoughts.
---
His
 manner was stunned and sluggish now.

---
Boldwood had.
---
had been the very lung of his hope;.
---
for he had
 held
---
though her fancy might not flood him with the iridescent
 hues of uncritical love
---
He came on looking upon the ground, and.
---
He looked up at the sound of her pit- pat, and
 his changed appearance sufficiently denoted to her the
 depth and strength of the feelings paralyzed by her
 letter.

---
Seeing, he said,"?"

---
"" said he."
---
" I wish."
---
I must not hear it now."

---
I have then
---
I am not, and
---
I want
---
Boldwood walked up to her heavily
 and dully.

---
Boldwood
 burst out.
---
-- I am come to that low,
 lowest stage--!
---
" It was only whispered, for something unutter-
 ably mournful no less than distressing in this spectacle
 of a man showing himself to be so entirely the vane of a
 passion.

---
" I am beyond myself about this, and."
---
he
 said.
---
" I am no stoic at all to he supplicating here; but

---
I do
---
I wish; but
---
" I do n't throw you off-- indeed, how can I?
---
I never
 had you."
---
before I thought of you
---
I do n't reproach you, for

---
even now I feel.
---
that I should have lived in
---
I say
---
couragement, I can not but contradict you."

---
I have bitterly repented of it
 -- ay, bitterly, and in tears.
---
" I do n't accuse you of it--
---
I deplore it.
---
I took for
 earnest
---
now this that I
 pray.
---
I wish my feeling more like yours!
---
could I but
---
how I should have cursed
 you
---
since, I can not
 do that,
---
for I love you too well
---
But I do n't
 speak now, and
---
I must bear it
---
" But I do pity you-- deeply-- O so deeply!"
---
to know that what is a pastime
 to all other men was death to you?
---
whilst his reproaches fell,
 but
---
Can a man fooled>
---
He immediately said with more resentment:"
---
I
 know where."

---
He was coming to
 Troy.
---
He did then know!
---
And
 the name fell from his lips the next moment.

---
" Why did Troy not leave my treasure alone?
---
" he
 asked, fiercely."
---
When I had no thought of injuring
 him
---
, why did he force himself upon your notice!

---
Before he worried you
---
when next I should have come to you your answer

---
I ask,?"

---
" I can not.
---
" I know.
---
But he stole in in my absence
 and.
---
he win you away before
---
I have lost my
 respect, my good name, my standing--.
---
I have no further claim upon you.

---
As for me, I had better go somewhere alone, and.
---
I loved a woman once.
---
I am now ashamed.

---
When I am dead
---
that he was
---
if I had got jilted
 secretly, and
---
His unreasonable anger terrified her, and
---
" You'll chatter with him doubtless about me.
---
Say to
 him," Boldwood would have died for me."
---
and
 you have given way to him,.
---
him to be not the
 man for you
---
He has kissed you--
---
-- he has kissed you.
---
although Boldwood was, in vehemence and glow
---
that he has kissed you
---
-- then he has!
---
" He has in spite of her fear,
 defiantly.."

---
said Boldwood,
.
---
Whilst I would have

---
Ah, a time of his life shall come
, and; and then may he
 ache, and wish, and curse, and yearn-- as I do now!"

---
when he will have
---
he has caused another man
---
for I love him true
---
Boldwood's ideas had reached that point of fusion at
 which outline and consistency entirely disappear.
---
He did not hear her at all now.

---
I'll punish him-- by my soul
---
I'll meet
 him, soldier or no, and
---
I'll horsewhip.
---
If he
 were a hundred men
---
I'd horsewhip him-- --
---
" He
 dropped his voice suddenly and unnaturally."
---
I've been
 blaming you,.
---
when he's the greatest sinner
---
He stole your dear
 heart away with his unfathomable lies!...
---
lt is a
 fortunate thing for him!

---
that he's gone back to his
 regiment-- and not here
---
that he's away up the country,
---
I hope.
---
he may not return here just yet
---
I pray God
.
---
he may not come into my sight,
---
for I may be tempted
 beyond myself
---
For a moment Boldwood stood so inertly after this
.
---
that his soul seemed
---
He turned his face
 away, and
---
his form was soon covered over
 by the twilight.

---
as his footsteps mixed in with the low
 hiss of the leafy trees
---
like Mr. Boldwood were incompre-
 hensible, dreadful
---
he was
---
Troy had not returned to his distant barracks but.
 
---
as
 Boldwood and others supposed,
---
; he would lose his self- mastery
---
as he had this
 evening
---
; Troy's blitheness might become aggressive
---
Boldwood's anger might
 then take the direction of revenge.
 
---
Her troubled spirit was far
 away with Troy.




 CHAPTER XXXII



 NIGHT--
---
the comer could be no less than a thief, who
 might probably have known the weakness of the house-
 hold on this particular night, and have chosen it on
 that account for his daring attempt.
---
Maryann,, having seen him depart had no fear.
---
jointed staircase with its hundred creaks, ran to Coggan's,
 the nearest house, and.
---
who now again lodged in his house as at first,
 and
---
" Hark!" said Gabriel.

---
said Gabriel, decisively.

---
" Faith, I do n't see how
---
." said Coggan.
---
till I come hither again
---
said Gabriel.

---
He ran down the hill towards Farmer Boldwood's.

---
" Farmer Boldwood is not at home."
---
said Coggan.
---
" I know."
 Less than five minutes brought up Oak again, running
 at the same pace, with two halters dangling from his hand.

---
what he's

---
said Coggan,.

---
I knew,"
."
---
said Gabriel,
---
Maryann, you go to he.
---
" Gabriel shouted to her
 from the top of the hedge.

---
Springing down into Boldwood's pastures, each
 pocketed his halter.
---
who,
 seeing the men empty- handed, docilely allowed them-
 selves to he seized by the mane,
---
Having neither bit nor
 bridle, Oak and Coggan extemporized the former by
 passing the rope in each case through the animal's
 mouth and looping it on the other side.
---
Oak vaulted
 astride, and
---
Coggan clambered up by aid of the hank,
.

---
" The villains!" said Gabriel.
---
Coggan
 suddenly pulled up Moll and.

---
" said Gabriel.

---
to track'em said Jan,.
---
He struck a light,
 and.
---
No wonder we do n't hear him.

---
I'd swear to his make among ten thousand."

---
" said Oak.
---
Coggan carried an old pinchbeck repeater which
 he had inherited from some genius in his family; and

---
He lighted another match, and ex-

---
" he said,.

---
Coggan's watch struck one.
---
, I know.
---
" said Gabriel.

---
" Only a trot now." said Coggan, cheerfully.
---
We
 shall overtake him in time."

---
A light was
 promptly struck upon his gaiters as before, and
---
" said Coggan.
---
Gabriel dismounted.
---
though I guess
---
said
 Gabriel,.
---
as he moved the match
 over the ground about the turning
---
Coggan, who, no
 less than the panting horses, had latterly shown signs
 of weariness
---
He screwed up his face and!"

---
" Lame." said Oak.

---
Coggan slowly staring still at the footprints
---
said Gabriel,.

---
Coggan recollected
 himself.

---
" We shall have him now!"
---
he exclaimed.

---
The keeper of that gate is the
 sleepiest man between here and London-- Dan Randall.

---
that's his name--.
---
when he was at
 Casterbridge gate
---
said Gabriel.

---
" Amble on upon the grass." said Coggan.

---
that there had been a previous call which
 they had not noticed, for on their close approach the
 door of the turnpike- house opened, and the keeper
 came out half- dressed, with a candle in his hand.
---
" Keep the gate close!" shouted Gabriel."
---
He has
 stolen the horse!"

---
Who?" said the turnpike- man.

---
Gabriel looked at the driver of the gig, and.

---
Coggan had, however, caught sight of
 her in the meanwhile.

---
he said,
 amazed.

---
" But how was,?" expostulated Coggan," and ladies do n't
 drive at these hours, miss, as a jineral rule of society."

---
", miss." said Coggan.
---
I got down and

---
I can manage
 very well
---
I shall be in Bath by daylight.

---
Coggan and Gabriel put about their horses, and,,.

---
said
 Coggan, curiously.

---
" Yes." said Gabriel, shortly.

---
" Coggan, suppose?"

---
" I am of one and the same mind."

---
The first was merely; the second
 to listen to Oak's entreaties, and Boldwood's denuncia-
 tions, and give up Troy altogether.

---
herself, nevertheless,
 had Troy been Boldwood
---
that he might soon cease
---
A letter to keep him away could
 not reach him in time,.

---
even if he should be disposed to

---
ticularly, till Boldwood was secure.
---
to drive to Bath during the night see Sergeant Troy in
 the morning before he set out to come to her.

---
all the men were a- field under a monochromatic Lammas
 sky, amid the trembling air and short shadows of noon.

---
Every drop of moisture not in the men's bottles
 and flagons in the form of cider was raining as perspira-
 tion from their foreheads and cheeks.
---
when Coggan
 saw a figure in a blue coat and brass buttons running
 to them across the field
---
" I wonder?
---
" he said.

---
I hope.
---
said Gabriel,.

---
Oak was not bound by his agreement to assist in the
 corn- field; but
---
, so he lent a
 hand.

---
He's dressed up in his best clothes
---
He hev been away from home for a few days,
;
---
since he's had that felon upon his finger
---
said Joseph
 Poorgrass,.
---
" He hev been away from home for a few days,
 since he's had that felon upon his finger; for' a said,
 since I ca n't work I'll have a hollerday." Twas a bad leg
 allowed, and
---
my father put his arm out of joint."
---
" Ay, and to have
 time to go courting said Jan Coggan, in an eclipsing
 tone,.

---
By this time Cainy was nearing the group of harvesters,
 and.

---
from which he took mouthfuls

---
as he ran
---
When he came close
---
, his mouth assumed the bell shape,
 and
---
he began.
   
---
" Now, Cainy!" said Gabriel, sternly. 
---
" How many
 more times must I tell you?
---
That's what
' tis, Mister Oak!
---
And I've been visiting to Bath
!"

---
because I had a felon on my thumb; yes, and l've
 seen-- ahok- hok
---
Directly Cain mentioned Bath
---
fortunately the erratic crumb did not improve his
 narrative powers, and
---
which dangled in front of the young man
 pendulum- wise
---
" Yes." he continued,," l've seed the world at last
 -- yes-- and I've seed our mis'ess-- ahok- hok- hok!"

---
his eyes follow
---
" Bother the boy!" said Gabriel.
---
Please, Mister Oak, a gnat have
 and!"

---
pore boy!" said Matthew Moon.

---
" I saw our mistress."
---
courting complete-- --" Losing the thread of his
 narrative at this point simultaneously with his loss of
 breath, their informant looked up and down the field
 apparently for some clue to it."
---
Well, I see our mis'ess
 and a soldier-- a- ha- a- wk!"

---
" Damn the boy!" said Gabriel.

---
"' Tis only my manner, Mister Oak,,"
 said Cain Ball,.
!
---
Here's some cider for him--
---
that'll cure his throat
---
,"
 said Jan Coggan,;

---
Joseph Poorgrass in the meantime beginning, and
---
that would
 follow Cainy Ball's strangulation in his cough
---
the
 history of his Bath adventures dying with him.

---
" For my poor self, I always say" please God" afore

---
I do anything."
---
said Joseph, in an unboastful voice;" and
 so should you, Cain Ball."
---
Mr. Coggan poured the liquor with unstinted liber-
 ality at the suffering Cain's circular mouth; half of it
 running down the side of the flagon, and half of what
.

---
Coggan, with-
 drawing the flagon
---
as he could speak
---
"' Tis my nater." mourned Cain."
---
I
 always was so excitable" True, true." said Joseph Poorgrass.
---
I knowed the
 boy's grandfather-- a truly nervous and modest man,
 even to genteel refinery.'
---
" Not at all, Master Poorgrass." said Coggan.
---
well, I wish to noise nothing abroad--
 nothing at all."
---
Yet I would rather
 my trifle were hid
---
he may have begrudged no gifts....

---
certain meek men may be named therein
---
" Cainy's grandfather was a very clever man."
---
which is called by his name to this day
---
he had no business to by rights
---
a were a clever man in the sense of the term
---
"' Tis trew' a used to bide about in a public- house wi' a
 woman in a way, but
 there--'."
" Now then." said Gabriel, impatiently,?
---
" I seed,
."
---
that his words were very effective as regarded
 Gabriel's emotions
---
And I think.
---
the sojer was
 Sergeant Troy
---
Gabriel's features seemed."
---
?" said
 Coggan.

---
The
 boy's meaning is.'
---
as such the boy's words should be suffered,
."

---
" I've
 heard."

---
said Cain," and.
---
I daresay."
---
" said Gabriel,.

---
when the sun shone upon the bright gown and his
 red coat-- my!
---
" And then I went into Griffin's and
---
then I went to Riggs's batty- cake shop,
 and.

---
whilst I was chawing'em down
---
And I walked on and
 seed a clock with a face as big as a baking trendle-- --"
"
---
" I'm coming to that,!"."
---
then I sha n't be
 able to tell ye nothing."

---
him tell it his own way
---
said Coggan.

---
Gabriel settled into a despairing attitude of patience,
 and
---
Cainy went on: --
" And.
---
And I went to grand
 churches and chapels.
---
Yes; he would kneel down and!--
---
that he'd earned
 by praying so excellent well
---
Ah yes, I wish."

---
I lived
 there
---
" And as good a man as ever walked.
---
as they'd be to him on
 a dull afternoon, when he's up in the pulpit lighted by
 the wax candles
---
I do n't believe
 poor Perhaps he's made of different stuff."
---
" than to wear
" em said Gabriel, grimly.
---
" A very right feeling-- very." said Joseph Poorgrass.

---
I,
 I'll play fair
---
And, thinks; so I went to High Church in the morning,
 and High Chapel in the afternoon.
---
" A right and proper boy." said Joseph Poorgrass.

---
And then- i did n't see no more of Miss Everdene at
 all."

---
" said Gabriel,
 indignantly.

---
said Coggan.
---
", he's not a coarse, ignorant man,."
---
for he
 was well brought up said Matthew, dubiously.
---
that made him a soldier
---
said Gabriel restlessly,?
---
said Joseph in the sepulchral tone the circumstances
 demanded,"
---
it will grind
 him to powder
---
said Cainy,.
---
" I do n't mind, but
---
I do n't like."

---
you
 swear like wicked Shimei, the son of Gera, who cursed
 as he came.
---
" No, I do n't!' to squander a pore
 boy's soul, Joseph Poorgrass-- that's what' tis!"
---
said
 Cain,.
---
I mane
---
" no getting at the rights of it" said Gabriel,
.

---
Gabriel, without making any
 pretence of being lively, did nothing to show that he
 was particularly dull.
---
However, Coggan knew pretty
, and
---
he said--
".
---
said Gabriel.





---
Gabriel was leaning over
 Coggan's garden- gate,
---
Oak instantly knew the
 voices to he those of Bathsheba and Liddy.

---
Oak could only luxuriate in the sense of it.
---
He lingered and.
---
Gabriel might have been
 there an additional half- hour when a dark form walked
 slowly by."
---
It was Boldwood."
---
" said Gabriel.

---
Boldwood likewise vanished up the road, and
---
Oak
 shortly afterwards turned indoors to bed.

---
Farmer Boldwood went on towards Miss Everdene's
 house.
---
He reached the front, and.
---
Her back was
 towards Boldwood.
---
He went to the door,.

---
Boldwood had not been outside his garden since
 his meeting with Bathsheba in the road to Yalbury.

---
Silent and alone, he had remained in moody medita-
 tion on woman's ways,.
---
he had
---
By degrees a
 more charitable temper had pervaded him, and
---
this
 was the reason of his sally to- night.
---
He had come to
 apologize and beg forgiveness of Bathsheba with some-
 thing like a sense of shame at his violence, having but
.

---
as he supposed
---
He inquired for Miss Everdene.
---
he did not notice it.
---
He had

---
who was to him simultaneously
---
he had shared with her

---
Boldwood did not hurry homeward.
---
, he heard the carrier's spring

---
driven by a Weatherbury man, at the door of whose
 house it now pulled up
---
" Ah!" said Boldwood to himself,."

---
Troy entered the carrier's house, which had been
 the place of his lodging on his last visit to his native
 place.
---
Boldwood was moved by a sudden determina-
 tion.
---
He hastened home.
---
In ten minutes he was
 back again, and.
---
as if he were going
---
as he approached
---
He heard
---
the voice
 was Troy's.
---
Boldwood, however, hastened up
 to him.
---
Troy had-- the same that he had brought with him.

---
as if he were going
---
Troy turned up the hill and.

---
Boldwood stepped forward.

---
" I am William Boldwood."

---
" I wish."
---
he said.

---
" I wonder at your impertinence."
---
said Troy,.

---
said Boldwood,,."

---
Troy heard the dull determination in Boldwood's
 voice,.
---
he carried in his hand
---
He remembered.
---
" Very well, I'll listen with pleasure.
---
" said Troy,
.
---
" Well then-- I know a good deal concerning your
 Fanny Robin's attachment to you.
---
I may say, too,.
---
that
 I believe,
---
I am the only person in the village
---
" I suppose.
---
I ought
---
I
 can not."

---
Troy was about to utter something hastily
---
; he then
 checked himself and."
---
I am too poor
---
His voice
 was changed.
---
Boldwood's present mood was not critical enough to
 notice tones.
---
He continued,".
---
I may as well speak
 plainly; and
---
I do n't wish
---
I intend a
 business transaction with you."

---
" I see.
---
" said Troy."
---
Troy heard the dull determination in Boldwood's
 voice,
---
I do n't wish,
---
the
" I was engaged
---
looked at his stalwart frame, then at the thick
 plainly; and understand, to enter into to be married to Miss Everdene"
 said Boldwood," but
---
" Not engaged" said Troy.

---
If I had not turned up
---
I should certainly
---
I ask

---
" I'll pay you well now
---
, I'll settle a sum of money
 upon her, and
---
I'll see.
---
I'll put it clearly.
---
this statement Boldwood's voice revealed
 only too clearly a consciousness of the weakness of his
 position, his aims, and his method
---
His manner had
 lapsed quite from that of the firm and; and
---
as he had

---
in he would have condemned as childishly
 imbecile only a few months ago
---
We discern a grand
 force in the lover which he lacks whilst a free man; but

---
there is a breadth of vision in the free man which in
 the lover we vainly seek.
---
Boldwood exemplified
 this to an abnormal degree:
---
he knew nothing of Fanny

---
, he knew nothing
 of Troy's possibilities, yet
---
what he said
---
" I like Fanny best."
---
said Troy;" and.
---
, why I have all to
 gain by accepting your money, and
---
" I do."

---
" Ah!" said Boldwood, in a more elastic voice.
---
" I love Fanny best now.
---
" said Troy."
---
said Boldwood,
---
He handed Troy a small packet.

---
said Boldwood.

---
whilst I at any rate have fifty pounds
---
if I ca n't appeal to your honour
---
that
 I can trust to your--

---
" Stop, listen!" said Troy in a whisper.

---
" he continued.
---
" I must go
 on and."

---
Troy whistled a
 double note in a soft, fluty tone.

---
said Troy.

---
" I promise again."

---
Troy stepped forward.

---
" Frank, dearest, is that you?"
---
" O God!" said Boldwood.

---
" Yes." said Troy to her.

---
I listened and, but
---
I had almost given you up, Frank.
---
" I was sure to come."
---
said Frank.
---
" Well, I thought.
---
I said to- morrow--."
" Capital." said Troy."
---
During the progress of this dialogue there was a
 nervous twitching of Boldwood's tightly closed lips, and

---
his face became.
---
He now
 started forward towards Troy.
---
Troy turned to him and
.

---
to say more to
 you-- more to you said Boldwood, in a hoarse whisper.

---
" Shall I tell her I have come?" I want!"" Now." said Troy,".
---
Perhaps
 I am a bad man-- the victim of my impulses--.
---
I ought
---
I ca n't
---
And I have two reasons for- choosing
 Fanny.
---
First, I like her best upon the whole, and
 second
---
Troy felt Boldwood's grasp slowly
 tightening.
---
he gasped.
---
Give me breath." said Troy.

---
Boldwood loosened his hand,!"

---
By Heaven,
 I've a mind to kill you
---
unless I marry her
---
Boldwood groaned.
---
He reluctantly released the
 soldier, and."
---
said he.

---
Troy rebounded like a ball, and; but
---
he checked himself,.
---
I shall shortly leave the army because of the same
 conviction.
---
" I'm glad you see it."

---
" Troy, make her your wife, and.
---
what
 I arranged just now
---
take Bathsheba; I give her up!
---
I shall
 be a mere slave to her.
---
I could do anything with poor
 Fanny Robin."

---
" Troy." said Boldwood, imploringly,
---
" I'll do anything
 for you,;
---
How shall I get
---
" I do n't wish."

---
Boldwood's arm moved spasmodically towards Troy's
 person again.
---
He repressed the instinct, and
---
his form
 drooped as with pain.

---
Troy went on--
"
---
I shall soon purchase my discharge, and then-- --"
"
---
But I wish!
---
I'll pay it down to
 you on the wedding- day."

---
Troy paused in secret amazement at Boldwood's
 wild infatuation.
---
He carelessly said,"?"

---
And am I to

---
But I have not much additional
 money with me.
---
I did not expect this; but
---
I have

---
Boldwood, more like a somnambulist than a wakeful
 man, pulled out the large canvas bag he carried by way
 of a purse, and.

---
" I have twenty- one pounds more with me."
---
he said.

---
before I leave you

---
But I must have a paper signed-- --"
" Pay me the money, and we'll go straight to her
 parlour, and make any arrangement you please to secure
 my compliance with your wishes.
---
" Nothing, nothing." said Boldwood, hastily.
---
, Troy said,"."
---
Opening the door, he glided inside,.

---
Boldwood waited.
---
Boldwood then saw.
---
Troy appeared
 inside,.

---
I should break in
---
" said
 Boldwood, contemptuously.

---
I'll hold the light."

---
Troy handed a folded newspaper through the slit
 between door and doorpost, and.

---
he said,.

---
Boldwood looked and.

---
" On the17th inst., at St. Ambrose's Church, Bath,
 by the Rev. G. Mincing, B.A., Francis Troy, only son
 of the late Edward Troy, Esq., H.D., of Weatherbury,
 and sergeant with Dragoon Guards, to Bathsheba, only
 surviving daughter of the late Mr, John Everdene, of
 Casterbridge."
" This may be called Fort meeting Feeble, hey,
 Boldwood?
---
" said Troy.
---
The paper fell from Boldwood's hands.
---
Troy
 continued--
" Fifty pounds to marry Fanny, Good.
---
Now, Boldwood,
 yours is the ridiculous fate which always attends inter-
 ference between a man and his wife.
---
as I am
---
Bad, I am not such a villain as to
.
---
I have searched everywhere.

---
that I've
 taught you a lesson
---
" I will not; I will not!
---
" said Boldwood, in a hiss.

---
" Anyhow I wo n't have it."
---
said Troy, contemptuously.

---
He wrapped the packet of gold in the notes, and.

---
Boldwood shook his clenched fist at him.
---
But I'll punish
 you yet
---
; mark me, I'll punish you yet!"

---
Troy then closed the
 door, and.

---
Just before the clock struck five Gabriel Oak and
 Coggan
---
when Oak fancied
---
he saw the opening
 of a casement in one of the upper windows
---
The two
 men were at this moment partially screened by an elder
 bush, now beginning to be enriched with black bunches
 of fruit, and
---
A handsome man leaned idly from the lattice.
---
He
 looked east and then west, in the manner of one who
 makes a first morning survey.
---
The man was Sergeant
 Troy.
---
His red jacket was loosely thrown on, but not
 buttoned, and he had altogether the relaxed bearing of
 a soldier taking his ease.

---
Coggan spoke first,.

---
he said.

---
Gabriel had previously beheld the sight, and
---
he now
 stood with his back turned,.

---
I fancied." con-
 tinued Coggan."
---
I heard
---
" Do I?" said Oak, with a faint smile.

---
" Lean on the gate: I'll wait a bit."

---
Gabriel listlessly
 staring at the ground
---
His mind sped into the future,
 and.
---
there enacted in years of leisure the scenes o
 repentance that would ensue from this work of haste
 That they were married he had instantly decided
---
The union
 was not only an unutterable grief to him:
---
that he had passed the preceding
 week in a suspicion that such might be the issue of
 Troy's meeting her away from home
---
he shouted, in a cheery voice,
.

---
Coggan replied to the greeting."
---
Bain't to
 answer the man" he then said to Gabriel.
---
I'd say
 good morning
---
Gabriel soon decided.

---
" he returned, in a
 ghastly voice.

---
" A rambling, gloomy house this." said Troy,.

---
suggested Coggan.

---
Gabriel shook his head.
---
the sun kindled his scarlet coat
 to an orange glow.

---
responded Gabriel.

---
" Yes-- I suppose so; but
---
I feel like new wine in an
 old bottle here.
---
the oak cleared quite away,
---
, I think.
---
" says he," and
---
The military man turned and.
---
Gabriel and Coggan began.

---
I am for making this place more modern,."
" Oh, Coggan." said Troy,?"

---
if insanity has ever appeared in Mr.
 Boldwood's family
---
Jan reflected for a moment.

---
" I once heard, but
---
that an uncle of his was queer in his
 head
---
I do n't know the rights o't."
---
he said.

---
said Troy,
---
Well,
 I shall be down in the fields with you some time this
 week; but
---
I have a few matters to attend to first.
---
I'm not a proud man:  nobody
.
---
Troy threw the coin dexterously across the front plot
 and over the fence towards Gabriel, who shunned it in
 its fall.
---
, his face turning to an angry red
---
Coggan
 twirled his eye,.

---
said Gabriel with
 disdain and almost fiercely.
---
" As for me, I'll do with-
 out gifts from him!"

---
said Coggan,
---
if he's married to her
---
For, mark my words, he'll buy
 his discharge and.
---
I ca n't
 go further than that.
---
only to be kept by smoothing him down.
---
" There's Mr. Boldwood."
---
said Oak.
---
" I wonder."

---
what
 Troy meant by his question
---
Coggan and Oak nodded respectfully to the farmer,
.

---
him pass on
---
Boldwood had

---
, were the want of colour in his well- defined face,
 the enlarged appearance of the veins in his forehead
 and temples, and the sharper lines about his mouth
---
The horse bore him away, and
---
Gabriel, for
 a minute, rose above his own grief in noticing Boldwood's.

---
He saw.
---
until the keen edges of Boldwood's
 shape sank by degrees over the hill
---
To one the man and his story there was something more striking
 in this immobility than in a collapse.
---
was there in the
 steadiness of this agonized man an expression deeper
 than a cry.





---
, a man stood

---
Oak gazed with misgiving at eight naked and un-
 protected ricks, massive and heavy with the rich
 produce of one- half the farm for that year.
---
He went
 on to the barn.

---
This was the night which had been selected by
 Sergeant Troy--.
---
As Oak
 approached the building the sound of violins and a
 tambourine, and the regular jigging of many feet,
---
He came close to the large doors,.

---
Tufts and garlands of green foliage decorated
 the walls, beams, and extemporized chandeliers, and
 immediately opposite to Oak a rostrum.
---
I hope
---
" Now, ma'am, and no offence, I ask what
 dance?
---
Troy was lolling beside her.

---
Gabriel delayed his entry no longer.
---
He avoided
 Bathsheba, and.
---
where Sergeant Troy was now seated
---
Gabriel could not easily thrust himself
 within speaking distance of the sergeant, and
---
he sent
 a message,.

---
he could not attend
---
" Will you tell him, then."
---
said Gabriel,"?
---
that I only
 stepped ath'art
---
" M. Troy says."" and
---
he can not stop."

---
In Juxtaposition with Troy, Oak had a melancholy
 tendency to look like a candle beside gas, and ill at
 ease
---
, he went out again,.
---
he would go home
---
for, under the circumstances, he had no heart for the
 scene in the barn
---
At the door he paused for a
 moment: 
---
Troy was speaking.

---
A short time ago I had the happiness to lead
 to the altar this lady, your mistress, and
---
that every man may go happy to bed
---
thoroughly
 well done, and,
 I have ordered.
---
A treble- strong
 goblet will he handed round to each guest."

---
he said,"!
'
---
If any of the men
 show the white feather
---
Thus Troy and the men on the farm were left sole
 occupants of the place.
---
Oak, not to appear unneces-
 sarily disagreeable, stayed a little while
---
; then he, too,
 arose and.

---
Gabriel proceeded towards his home.
---
In approach-
 ing the door, his toe kicked something which felt and
.
---
Oak took it up,; but
---
finding
 it uninjured, he placed it again among the grass.
---
He
 knew.
---
When he struck a light indoors there
---
Oak's eyes followed
 the serpentine sheen to the other side, where it led up
 to a huge brown garden- slug, which had come indoors
 to- night for reasons of its own.
---
It was Nature's second
 way of hinting to him.

---
that he was
---
Oak sat down.

---
This reminded him.

---
that he
 thoroughly understood
---
He left the room,.

---
that, on the sudden appearance of Oak's
 head over the fence, they did not stir or
---
They had now a terror of something greater than their
 terror of man.
---
He knew now.
---
that he was right, and
---
that
 Troy was wrong
---
Oak returned to the
 stack- yard.
---
that of necessary food for man
 and beast:  should the risk be run of deteriorating this
 bulk of corn to less than half its value, because of the
 instability of a woman?"Never,
---
if I can prevent it
---
said Gabriel.

---
Such was the argument that Oak set outwardly before
 him.
---
But man, even to himself, is a palimpsest,.

---
:" I will help to my last effort the
 woman I have loved so dearly."

---
He went back to the barn to endeavour.
---
he would have passed on in the
 belief that the party had broken up,.

---
Gabriel looked in.
---
An unusual picture met his eye.

---
Coggan was on his back, with his mouth
 open, huzzing forth snores,
---
Joseph
 Poorgrass was curled round in the fashion of a hedge-
 hog, apparently in attempts to present the least possible
 portion of his surface to the air; and
---
Gabriel glanced hopelessly at the group, which, with
 one or two exceptions, composed all the able- bodied
 men upon the farm.
---
He saw at once.

---
that to be saved that night,
 he must save them with his own hands
---
It was Coggan's watch striking the hour of
 two.

---
Oak went to the recumbent form of Matthew Moon,
 who usually undertook the rough thatching of the home-
 stead, and shook him.
---
Gabriel shouted in his ear,"?"

---
Gabriel let, and
---
He then went to Susan Tall's
 husband.

---
To be shouted to at night was evidently
 less of a novelty to Susan Tall's husband than to
 Matthew Moon.
---
Oak flung down Tall's head into the
 corner again and.

---
To be just, the men were not greatly.
---
Sergeant Troy had
---
Gabriel was greatly depressed.
---
This debauch boded
 ill for that wilful and fascinating mistress whom the
 faithful man even now felt within him as the embodi-
 ment of all that was sweet and bright and hopeless.

---
He put out the expiring lights,.
---
A hot breeze, as if breathed from the
 parted lips of some dragon about to swallow the globe,
 fanned him from the south,.
---
Going on to the village, Oak flung a small stone
 against the window of Laban Tall's bedroom,; but
---
He went round
 to the back door, which had been left unfastened for
 Laban's entry, and.

---
" Mrs. Tall, I've come for the key of the granary,
 to get at the rick- cloths." said Oak, in a stentorian
 voice.

---
" Yes." said Gabriel.

---
" It is n't Laban--' tis Gabriel Oak.
---
I want the key
 of the granary."

---
" I did n't.
---
I thought-- --"
!
---
disturbing women at this time of night ought--  Gabriel took the key, without waiting to hear the
 conclusion of the tirade.
---
Ten minutes later his lonely
 figure might have been seen, and
---
Oak looked under the staddles and.
---
He mounted the third pile of wealth and.

---
Gabriel saw a candle shining in Bath-
 sheba's bedroom, and
---
Gabriel from
 his elevated position could see over the landscape at
 least half- a- dozen miles in front.
---
that Gabriel worked entirely by feeling with his hands
---
He had stuck his ricking- rod, or poniard,-- a long iron lance, polished by
 handling-- into the stack, used to support the sheaves
 instead of the support called a groom used on houses,
 A blue light appeared in the zenith, and in some in-
 describable manner flickered down near the top of the
 rod.
---
Gabriel felt,
 and
---
his position to be anything but a safe one
---
he resolved.

---
He wiped his
 weary brow, and.
---
Was his life so valuable to
 him after all?
---
What were his prospects that he
 should be so chary of running risk, when important
 and
---
He resolved.
---
ever, he took a precaution.
---
This he carried up the ladder, and

---
he drove in.
---
he
 felt himself comparatively safe.

---
Before Oak had laid his hands upon his tools again
 out leapt the fifth flash, with the spring of a serpent
 and the shout of a fiend.
---
the light revealed to him?
---
as he looked over the ridge of
 the rick
---
then he could see no more.

---
" said Gabriel to the darkness.

---
I am on the rick, thatching."
 I have come about
 them. I thought of the
 corn. I am so distressed about it I can not find my husband. Is he with you?"

---
He is not here.
---
where he is
---
" He promised,
 and
---
said Gabriel.
---
" I'll do anything!"
---
Gabriel turned his
 head.
---
It had been the sixth flash which had come from
 the east behind him, and
---
the two dark forms on the
 slope had been the shadows of himself and Bathsheba.

---
Gabriel turned, and.
---
while he was still reversed in his attitude
---
he saw,, a copy of the tall
 poplar tree on the hill drawn in black on the wall of
 the barn.
---
as Gabriel hastily drove them in
---
He thought.

---
" Hold on!" said Gabriel,.

---
In the meantime one of
 the grisly forms had alighted upon the point of Gabriel's
 rod,.
---
Gabriel was, and
---
he could
 feel; but
---
Bathsheba's warm arm tremble in his hand-- a
 sensation novel and thrilling enough
---
Oak had hardly time to gather up these impressions
 into a thought, and to see how strangely the red feather
 of her hat shone in this light, when the tall tree on the
 hill before mentioned seemed on fire to a white heat,
 and a new one among these terrible voices mingled with
 the last crash of those preceding.
---
By the
 lustre reflected from every part of the earth and from the
 wide domical scoop above it, he saw.
---
" said Gabriel, hurriedly.

---
he could distinctly hear
 her rhythmical pants, and the recurrent rustle of the
 sheaf beside her in response to her frightened pulsations.

---
on second thoughts, he
 followed her.
---
to think
 only of the weather-- Oak thought only of her just then.

---
At last he said--
."

---
" I think so too."
---
" Nothing serious." said he.
---
said Oak,
 in a hesitating way.

---
O, I know it all-- all."
---
said Gabriel.
---
" I will go and.
---
He crossed to the barn,
---
He
 looked through the chinks of the door.
---
as he had left it
---
He felt, and.

---
He endeavoured,."

---
Then Oak went back again,,
.
---
Oak looked up at her.
---
he left the barn.
---
he said.

---
" I suppose?"

---
when I galloped away
 to Bath that night
---
I did at last-- not at first."
---
he answered, somewhat
 surprised at the abruptness with which this new subject
 was broached.
"
---
" I thought so.
---
Now, I care a little for your good
 opinion, and
---
I want
---
- i have
 longed, and
---
ever since I returned
---
if I were
---
For to die-- and I may die
 soon
---
Gabriel ceased his rustling.

---
" I went to Bath that night in the full intention of
 breaking off my engagement to Mr. Troy.
---
" I do-- somewhat."

---
I must
---
", I suppose,
---
that I have
 begun
---
I
 have mentioned.
---
Well, I was alone in a strange city,
 and
---
And at last I did n't know
.
---
I saw,.
---
, that scandal
 might seize hold of me for meeting him alone in that
 way
---
But I was coming away,....
---
when he suddenly said

---
he had that day
---
that his constancy could not be counted on
---
unless
 I at once became his
---
And I was
---
And then, between
 jealousy and distraction, I married him!
---
Gabriel made no reply.

---
" He was not,-- about his seeing somebody else."
---
" And now I do n't wish for a single remark from you
 upon the subject-- indeed
---
, I forbid it.
---
I only wanted
.--
---
Gabriel soon perceived a languor in the movements of
 his mistress up and down, and
---
he said to her, gently as
 a mother--
.
---
" I think
---
I can finish the rest alone.
---
If I am useless
---
" I will go." in a
 flagging cadence."
---
he
 heard.

---
He worked in a reverie now,.

---
He was disturbed in his meditation by a grating
 noise from the coach- house.
---
, Oak slaved
 away again at the barley.
---
A huge drop of rain smote
 his face, the wind snarled round every corner, the trees
 rocked to the bases of their trunks, and
---
Driving in spars at any point and on any
 system, inch by inch he covered more and more safely
 from ruin this distracting impersonation of seven hundred
 pounds."
---
Oak soon felt
 the water to be tracking cold and clammy routes down
 his back.
---
Ultimately he was reduced well- nigh to a
 homogeneous sop, and the dyes of his clothes trickled
 down and stood in a pool at the foot of the ladder.

---
The rain stretched obliquely through the dull atmo-
 sphere in liquid spines, unbroken in continuity between
 their beginnings in the clouds and their points in him.

---
Oak suddenly remembered.
---
that eight months before
 this time he had been fighting against fire in the same
 spot as desperately as he was fighting against water
 now-- and for a futile love of the same woman
---
As for
 her-- --  But Oak was generous and true, and dis-

---
when Gabriel came down from the last stack,
 and
---
He was
 yet not so sad as drenched
 and weary,.

---
for he was cheered by a sense of success in
 a good cause
---
he looked
 that way.
---
who wore a red jacket, and advanced
 with his hands in his pockets, whistling
---
Not a single one of them had turned his face to the
 ricks, or.

---
Soon Oak too went homeward, by a different route
 from theirs.
---
In front of him against the wet glazed
 surface of the lane he saw.
---
a person walking yet more
 slowly than himself under an umbrella
---
The man
 turned and
---
plainly started; he was Boldwood.

---
said Oak.

---
-- Oh, I am well, very well
---
, I
 thank you; quite well."

---
" I am glad to hear it, sir."

---
Boldwood seemed.

---
" he said then, desultorily
.

---
" I am tired.
---
Not a bit of it:  I am well enough.
---
" I thought."

---
said Boldwood,
 shortly.
---
" I've been working hard,
 and.
---
Boldwood added, after an interval of
 silence: "?"

---
I forgot."

---
I
 overlooked the
 ricks this year."

---
" repeated Gabriel slowly to him-
 self.
---
that announcement had upon Oak at such a
 moment
---
All the night he had been feeling-- the only instance of the kind within the circuit
 of the county.
---
he was labouring
---
A few months earlier Boldwood's
 forgetting ous an idea as a sailor forgetting he was in a ship.
---
his husbandry would have been as preposter-

---
Oak
 was just thinking
---
whatever he himself might have

---
when Boldwood spoke in a
 changed voice-- that of one who yearned to make a
 confidence and relieve his heart by an outpouring
---
I may as well own it.
---
I was
 going; but
---
" I thought,"
."
---
said Gabriel,
---
" he added, with the repose of
 a man whom misfortune had inured rather than sub-
 dued.

---
" I daresay."
---
I am a joke about the parish
---
as if the subject came irresistibly to his tongue,
 and
---
Boldwood stood still now and."
---
" he continued,
---
Yes,
 He prepared a gourd, and
---
But the next day He
 prepared a worm to smite the gourd and wither it; and

---
" I
 am weak and foolish, and I do n't know what, and I
 ca n't fend off my miserable grief!... I had some faint
 belief in the mercy of God till I lost that woman. like the prophet
 I thanked Him and. I feel!"
 Boldwood aroused himself from
 the momentary mood of confidence into which he had
 drifted, and walked on again, resuming his usual reserve,
" No, Gabriel.
---
he resumed, with a carelessness which
 was like the smile on the countenance of a skull
---
Though on foot, he held the reins and
 whip, and.
---
This
 man was her husband, formerly Sergeant Troy, who,
 having bought his discharge with Bathsheba's money,
 was gradually transforming himself into a farmer of a
 spirited and very modern school.
---
I do feel a little regret occasionally, but Well,
 good morning; I can trust you."




 CHAPTER XXXIX



 COMING HOME-- I returning from market.
 People of unalter-
 able ideas still insisted upon calling him" Sergeant"
 hen they met him, which was in some degree owing
 to his having still retained the well- shaped moustache
 of his military days, and the soldierly bearing insepar-
 able from his form and training.

---
I
 should have cleared two hundred as easy as looking,
 my love." he was saying.
---
Troy had
 turned towards the gig, and
---
Troy started visibly at the sound of the voice; yet

---
he seemed.
---
He said, slowly--
."

---
" I do n't know
---
him speak
---
said Troy,.
---
: I'll see to
 the woman."

---
I thought
!
---
" said Troy to the woman, in a strangely
 gentle, yet hurried voice,.

---
as he lifted her up
---
" I feared to."

---
" Good Heaven-- I wish!

---
I had more
---
I have left
---
I have none but what my wife
 gives me,, and
---
I ca n't ask her now."

---
" I have only another moment."
---
" Yes; I thought."

---
Yes, perhaps for
 to- night; I can do nothing better-- worse luck!
---
I'll bring all the money I can muster.
---
that, Fanny; then I'll get you
---
I am a brute
 -- but good- bye!"

---
Troy
 then came on towards his wife,.
---
He was
 rather agitated.

---
" said Bath-
 sheba, looking searchingly into his face.

---
he said,.

---
" I thought."
---
He suddenly seemed.

---
" he said.
---
" I know her
 by sight."

---
" How should I know her name?"

---
" I think."

---
" Meet him
 the day after to- morrow: God help me!
---
He was huge, heavy, and quiet creature, standing
 darkly against the low horizon, and at least two feet
 higher than the present position of her eyes.
---
He seemed.
---
Being thus assignable to no
 breed, he was the ideal embodiment of canine greatness
 -- a generalization from what was common to all.
---
, he
 licked her hand again.

---
he trotted on
---
Then,
 finding, he came back and.

---
The dog,,
 was frantic in his distress on these occasions
---
; he would
 tug at her dress and.
---
that he would give up a
 year's rental-- and
---
very probably the
 inmates would have given up the view for his year's
 rental
---
a man appeared inside.

---
He discerned the panting heap of clothes,.
---
He entered a second
 time, and.

---
The man then closed the door.

---
" Where is he gone?
---
He helped me."

---
said the man.

---
he was not
 disposed to say much to her.
---
He exhibited the un-
 pleasant combination of a restless condition with a
 silent tongue.
---
I stoned him away." In the
 evening Troy said, suddenly--
?"

---
The anxiety upon
 Troy's face was unusual and very marked.
---
lt was a
 culmination of the mood he had been in all the day.

---
Troy for the moment made no reply.
---
Her mistake
 had its advantages to a man who shrank from having
 his mind inspected as he did now."
---
he said, at last.

---
Few men could have

---
, Troy would have succumbed instantly
---
;, he thought.

---
he would not deceive her longer
---
that I was far sweeter than all your
 other pleasures put together, and I
 can think of","
 he said.

---
Troy hesitated.
---
He did not now love her enough
.
---
himself to be carried too far by her ways
---
, he said.
---
" I think."
---
that I have a right to grumble a little if I
 pay
---
as he
 spoke
---
Troy,, looked at his watch, and,,.

---
Troy had instantly closed his watch.
---
He carelessly
 replied, as one who cloaked some feelings that the sight
 had stirred."
---
I had quite forgotten."

---
that I had it
---
" I tell you!"
---
I had forgotten it
---
he said, loudly.

---
" I do n't mean."

---
I know.
---
I want."

---
" Very well I'll tell you, so.
---
" I can not do that."

---
" he inquired, quickly.

---
said Troy,.
---
If I cared for
 your love as much as I used to I
---
Troy had by this time driven her to bitterness
---
when
 I married you.

---
I would have died for you
---
-- how truly I can say!
---
that I
 would have died for you
---
now that I am in your power
---
" I ca n't help."
---
said Troy;"!"

---
Frank went on."
---
as if he had not heard her
---
I only repent it
---
" I do n't know.
---
; I ca n't help.
---
when I took it from a drawer
---
" Until to- day,, I have
 never looked upon that bit of hair for several months--
."

---
that I am ready to swear
---
as he did so
---
Directly he had gone
---
that her lips had been
 touched by no man's on earth
---
that her husband had risen,
---
self preceded in forethought by Gabriel Oak, for whom
 she began to entertain the genuine friendship of a sister.

---
what
 life with him as a husband would have been like
---
when
 Troy's neglect was more than ordinarily evident
---
It was Mr. Boldwood.
---
The two men then
 approached each other and.

---
Boldwood and
 Gabriel called to him,.

---
Joseph immediately coming
 up the hill with his barrow
---
when Boldwood turned
 back again
---
He set down his barrow, and,.

---
Mr. Boldwood is going."

---
Mr. Boldwood do any such
 thing
---
that Mrs. Troy will take upon herself the duty
 of fetching an old servant of the family
---
Joseph, have the
 new spring waggon with the blue body and red wheels,
 and.
---
that the
 Union, in the form of four labouring men, will meet me
, and
---
"
" Joseph, come hither a moment.
---
that he might no

---
Joseph, dressed in his best suit of clothes, was
 putting in the horse.
---
What Oak and Mr. Boldwood told me
---
Gabriel said,.

---
I was very sorry, and and
---
,' he said,` and perhaps' tisn't much matter
 about how she came to die
---
Mr. Boldwood turned round to me then, and
.
---
He
 told me about her having lived by seampstering in
 Melchester, as I mentioned to you, and.
---
he said.

---
" I wonder.
---
why Gabriel did n't bring the message to
 me himself
---
He mostly makes a point of seeing me
 upon the most trifling errand."
---
" Not a word, mistress, I assure' ee!"" Perhaps he was busy, ma'am."
---
Joseph suggested.

---
" And sometimes he seems.'
---
when he was better
 off than' a is now
---
" Did anything seem upon his mind?"

---
whilst he was

---
" I can not but say.
---
He was
 terrible down, and
---
so was Farmer Boldwood.

Her young man was a soldier

", was he not?"

---
He says
?
---
he knew him very well."What
---
, Mr. Troy says so
---
How came he that?"

---
if
 he knew Fanny's young man

He said,"."

---
O yes, he
 knew the young man as well as he knew himself, and

---
that there was n't a man in the regiment he liked
 better
---
that, did he

" Yes; and he said

there was a strong likeness be-
 tween himself and the other young man, so that some-

CHAPTER XLII



 JOSEPH AND HIS BURDEN


 A WALL bounded the site of Casterbridge Union-
 house, except along a portion of the end.
---
laid by two men in fustian along the middle of the
 vehicle
---
One of the men then stepped up beside it,.
---
He covered the
 whole with a black cloth, threadbare, but decent,.

---
the
 tailboard of the waggon was returned to its place, one
 of the men handed a certificate of registry to Poorgrass,
 and both entered the door, closing it behind them
---
Joseph then placed the flowers, and the
 evergreens around the flowers, till it was difficult to
 divine what the waggon contained
---
as enjoined; he smacked his
 whip, and.

---
as he walked beside the horse, Poor-
 grass
---
Joseph Poorgrass looked round upon his sad burden
,
 then at the unfathomable gloom amid the high trees on
 each hand, indistinct, shadowless, and spectrelike in
 their monochrome of grey.
---
He felt anything but cheer-
 ful, and.
---
he had the company even of a child or
 dog
---
Stopping the home, he listened.
---
The nearer boughs were beaded
 with the mist to the greyness of aged men, and
---
that the waggon was standing into which Gabriel Oak
 crept on his first journey to Weatherbury
---
It was a relief to Joseph's heart,
---
, he proceeded.
---
His spirits were

---
He turned the horse's head
 to the green bank, and.

---
, what should
 Joseph see.
---
said Joseph,
---
I assure ye,, and
---
I ha'n't seed
 the colour of victuals or drink since breakfast time
 this morning
---
said Coggan,.

---
" I'm sure your face do n't praise your mistress's table,
 Joseph."
" I've had a very pale companion for the last four
 miles."." Joseph drank for a moderately long time, then for
 a longer time,,"' Tis
 pretty drinking-- very pretty drinking, and is more
 than cheerful on my melancholy errand, so to speak it."

---
as he lowered the jug
---
who repeated a truism so familiar to his brain that he
 hardly noticed its passage over his tongue; and,

---
Jan, as one
 lifting the cup, Coggan tilted his head gradually
 backwards, with closed eyes,
---
that his expectant soul
 might not be diverted for one instant from its bliss
 by irrelevant surroundings
---
" Well, I must be on again."
---
said Poorgrass.
---
that I should like another nip with ye; but
---
if I was seed
 here
---
I've got poor little Fanny

---
I must be at the
 churchyard gates at a quarter to five with her."

---
However, I
 expect."

---
" A pretty maid as ever I see!
---
" I do n't mind.
---
leads us to
 that horned man in the smoky house" said Mark Clark.
---
said
 Joseph.

---
" Well, I hope."
---
said Joseph.

---
" I've been troubled with weak moments lately,' tis
 true.
---
I've been drinky once this month already,
---
and
 I did not go to church a- Sunday, and
---
I dropped a
 curse or two yesterday;.
---
so I do n't want
---
" I believe.
---
That
 I do."

---
I do n't go so far as that."

---
" Well, really, I must be onward again now."" For my part." said Coggan,"."

---
I'm staunch Church
 of England
---
Coggan continued, with that tendency to talk on
 principles which is characteristic of the barley- corn
---
a man can
 belong to the Church and bide in his cheerful old
 inn, and never trouble or worry his mind about
 doctrines at all
---
said Joseph, thoughtfully.

---
" Yes." said Coggan.
---
I bain't such a fool,.
---
But I hate a feller who'll
 change his old ancient doctrines for the sake of getting
 to heaven.
---
I'd as soon turn king's- evidence for the
 few pounds you get.
---
though
 he hardly had one for his own use, and
---
If it had n't been for him
---
No, I'll stick to my side; and
---
I'll fall with the fallen!"

---
--
" However, folks, I must be moving now: upon my life

---
I must.
---
" Joseph Poorgrass, do n't be so miserable!
---
He's a generous man
---
; he's found

---
I've consumed a good many
 in the course of a long and shady life; but
---
he's never

---
The longer Joseph Poorgrass remained,.
---
the less his
 spirit was troubled by the duties which devolved upon
 him this afternoon
---
Coggan's repeater struck
 six from his pocket in the usual still small tones.

---
He
 stared sternly at the one lengthy and two round faces
 of the sitters, which confronted him with the expressions
 of a fiddle and a couple of warming- pans.
---
" Upon my soul, I'm ashamed of you;' tis disgraceful,
 Joseph, disgraceful!
---
" said Gabriel, indignantly."
---
Coggan,
 you call yourself a man, and."

---
Coggan looked up indefinitely at Oak, one or other
 of his eyes,.

---
at length said
 Coggan, with the precision of a machine."
---
why should a man put himself in a tearing hurry for
 lifeless clay that can neither feel nor see, and?
---
, I would have been the first to help her.
---
, I'd pay for it, money
 down.
---
Jan meanwhile merging
 his additional thoughts of to- morrow in a song: --
 To- mor- row, to- mor- row
---
And,
 With a heart free from sick- ness and sor- row,
 With my friends will I share
---
said Oak; and
---
I look double to
 you
---
i mean
---
said Joseph Poorgrass, meekly.

---
" Yes; I see two of every sort,....
---
as if I were some holy
 man living in the times of King Noah and entering
 into the ark
---
he added,;
---
becoming much
 affected by the picture of himself, and
---
" I feel too good for England:

---
shedding tears I ought and
---
then I should n't have!"

---
" I wish!"

---
you'd show yourself a man of spirit, and
---
me be a
 man of contrite knees- iet
---
that I always
 do say" Please God" afore
---
I do anything, from my
 getting up to my going down of the same, and
---
I be
 willing to take as much disgrace as there is in that
 holy act.
---
Have I ever allowed?
---
that
 I question the right to do so
---
I inquire that query
 boldly?"

---
Never have I allowed
---
that I be not a man of spirit
---
Gabriel, seeing
---
He pulled the horse's head from the large patch
 of turf it had eaten bare,.

---
But, thanks to Boldwood's
 reticence and Oak's generosity, the lover had never been individualized as Troy.
---
Gabriel hoped
.

---
that Gabriel reached the old manor-
 house, her residence, which lay in his way to the church
---
A man came from the gate and
---
" Is that Poorgrass with the corpse?"

---
Gabriel recognized the voice as that of the parson.

---
"" said Gabriel.

---
" I have just been.
---
I am afraid it is too
 late now for the funeral to be performed with proper
 decency.
---
" No." said Gabriel.
---
" I expect;
 and
---
Poorgrass has that
---
he's at the Buck's Head.
---
I forgot."

---
Gabriel had his reasons for thinking the latter a
 most objectionable plan, notwithstanding that Fanny
.
---
which might arise from this delay
 flitted before him
---
But his will was not law, and
---
he
 went indoors.
---
He found her in an unusual
 mood: .
---
Troy
 had not yet returned.
---
Oak argued upon the convenience of leaving
 her in the waggon,
---
Perhaps Mrs. Troy is right in feeling that we
 can not treat a dead fellow- creature too thoughtfully

---
Gabriel shed an
 honest tear.
---
Mr.
 Thirdly then left them, and
---
Gabriel lighted a lantern.

---
Fetching three other men to assist him, they bore the
 unconscious truant indoors,.

---
Every one except Gabriel Oak then left the room.

---
He still indecisively lingered beside the body.
---
He was
 deeply troubled at the wretchedly ironical aspect that
 circumstances were putting on with regard to Troy's
 wife, and at his own powerlessness to counteract them,
( n
---
spite of his careful manoeuvring all this day, the very
 worst event had happened now.
---
Oak
 imagined a terrible discovery resulting from this after-

---
Suddenly, as in a last attempt to save Bathsheba
 from, at any rate, immediate anguish, he looked again,
.
---
as he had looked before, at the chalk writing upon the
 coffinlid
---
" Gabriel took his handkerchief and
.
---
He then left the
 room, and.





---
if he has not arrived by
 that time
---
" I'll sit up for master, ma'am. I am not
 at all afraid of Fanny, if I may sit in my own room and
. She was such a childlike, nesh young
 thing that her spirit could n't appear to anybody if it
 tried, I'm quite sure. I'll sit up for him
 myself till twelve o'clock, and if he has not arrived by
 that time, I shall give him up and."
" Oh! is it?"

---
And within the last day or two had come these
 disquieting thoughts about her husband's past.
---
it would be more accurately described as a
 determined rebellion against her prejudices, a revulsion
 from a lower instinct of uncharitableness, which would
 have withheld all sympathy from the dead woman, be-
 cause in life she had preceded Bathsheba in the atten-
 tions of a man whom Bathsheba had by no means
 ceased from loving, though her love was sick to death
 just now with the gravity of a further misgiving.

---
Oak
 may have had the best of intentions in withholding for
 as many days as possible the details of what had
 happened to Fanny; but
---
had he known.

---
,
 he would have done nothing to lengthen the minutes of
 suspense she was now undergoing, when the certainty
 which must terminate it would be the worst fact suspected
 after all
---
What a way Oak had
---
who seemed so much deeper and
 higher and stronger in feeling than Gabriel
---
Boldwood,, had not
 yet learnt, any more than she herself, the simple
 lesson which Oak showed a mastery of by every turn
 and look he gave-- that among the multitude of interests
 by which he was surrounded, those which affected his
 personal wellbeing were not the most absorbing and
 important in his eyes.
---
Oak meditatively looked upon
 the horizon of circumstances without any special regard
 to his own standpoint in the midst.
---
But then Oak was not racked
 by incertitude upon the inmost matter of his bosom,.
---
Oak knew all about Fanny
--
---
he wished
---
"
 he would feel.
---
He knew her so well that no
 eccentricity of behaviour in her would alarm him.

---
where he now lived alone
---
Yes,
 it was Gabriel himself who was sitting up: 
---
he was reading,

---
which stood beside him
---
At length he looked
 at the clock,,.
---
He was going to bed,

---
Gabriel appeared in
 an upper room,.
---
which Oak's example had raised in her
---
there was no longer much room for doubt as
 to the origin of the curl owned by Troy.
---
The vision of Oak kneeling
 down that night recurred to her, and with the imitative
 instinct which animates women she seized upon the idea,

---
Gabriel had
 prayed; so
---
her husband appeared
 at the entrance to the room,.

---
He beheld it all by degrees,.
---
as if he thought it an illusion raised by some
 fiendish
 incantation
---
as he stood with the
 door in his hand
---
that at this moment,, Troy never once thought of Fanny in
 connection with what he saw.
---
His first confused idea
 was.

---
" Well-- what?" said Troy, blankly.

---
" I must go!
---
I must go!
---
said Troy.

---
I can not say
---
I want air!"
---
" But no; stay, I insist!"
---
He seized her hand, and

---
He, still holding her, came up the
 room, and.

---
Troy and Bathsheba
 approached the coffin's side
---
Troy looked
 in
---
knowledge of it all came
 over him in a lurid sheen, and
---
he stood still.

---
So still he remained.
---
that he could be imagined to

---
" said Troy.

---
He had originally stood perfectly erect.
---
He was gradually sinking forwards.
---
The lines of his
 features softened, and
---
What Troy did
---
that was forgotten in the simple and still strong
 attachment of wife to husband
---
O, Frank, I can"t it
---
bear
- i ca n't!
---
I love you better than she did
---
There was something so abnormal and startling in
 the childlike pain and simplicity of this appeal from a
 woman of Bathsheba's calibre and independence, that
 Troy, loosening her tightly clasped arms from his neck,
 looked at her in bewilderment.
---
that Troy could hardly seem
---
When the momentary
" I will not kiss you!"
---
he said.

---
he answered.

---
, I should have

---
He turned to Fanny then."
---
It was the product*
 of her union with Troy.

---
"--  that,-- what-- am I?"
---
said Troy,
 heartlessly.
---
I am not morally yours.
---
A vehement impulse to flee from him, to run from
 this place, hide, and escape his words at any price, not
 stopping short of death itself, mastered Bathsheba now.

---
Presently he came opposite,
 and
---
that he was one of
 the boys on her own farm
---
He was followed by a
 shambling tramp of heavy feet, and looking through
.
---
He was a schoolboy, with a
 bag slung over his shoulder containing his dinner,
 and a hook in his hand.
---
He paused by the gate,
 and, without looking up, continued murmuring words
 in tones quite loud enough to reach her ears.

---
that I know out o' book.
---
that I know
---
that": -- that I know
---
The boy was of the
 dunce class apparently
---
this was his way of learning the collect.
---
till he too passed on
---
" Is he at home?"

---
" No; he left."

---
There is one position worse than that of being found
 dead in your husband's house from his ill usage, and

---
who murdered his
 wife Desdemona
---
; a precaution to be
 needless as against Troy, for he did not appear in the
 neighbourhood or trouble them at all.
---
the young men of the village gathered,
, for a game of Prisoners' base
---
because two men came just then from
 Casterbridge and
---
his first act was.

---
he ascended the stairs, and
---
as he was
---
throwing himself
 down upon the bed dressed, he waited miser-
 ably for the morning.

---
Fate had dealt grimly with him through the last four-
 and- twenty hours.
---
His day had been spent in a way
 which varied very materially from his intentions regard-

---
,
 he had managed.
---
he
 could muster on his own account, which had been seven
 pounds ten
---
With this money, twenty- seven pounds ten
 in all, he had hastily driven from the gate that morning
.

---
On reaching Casterbridge he left the horse and trap
 at an inn, and
---
A rush of recollection
 came upon Troy
---
as he waited
---
: this was the second
 time she had broken a serious engagement with him

---
In anger he vowed and
---
he had lingered and
---
till he knew every lichen upon their face
 and
---
till they
 oppressed him
---
at eleven
 o'clock, when watched the stone
 of the bridge heard the chink of the ripples underneath, he jumped from his seat,
---
He reached the race- course at two o'clock, and re-
 mained either there or in the town till nine,
---
as it had appeared to him in the sombre
 shadows of that Saturday evening
---
But
 Fanny's image,, returned to his mind,
.
---
He vowed, and
---
he
 would not bet
---
he kept his vow, for on leaving the
 town at nine o'clock in the evening.

---
he had diminish
 his cash only to the extent of a few shillings
---
He trotted slowly homeward, and
---
He regretted.
---
that he had not remained in Casterbridge
 and
---
Reaching home he quietly un-
,
 to the fearful shock that awaited him.

---
As soon to distinguish objects,
 Troy arose from the coverlet of the bed, and in a mood
 of absolute indifference to Bathsheba's whereabouts, a
 almost oblivious of her existence
---
, he stalked downstairs
 and.
---
His walk was
 towards the churchyard,.
---
which he searched
 around
---
till he found a newly dug unoccupied grave--
 the grave dug the day before for Fanny
---
The position
 of, he hastened on to Caster-
 bridge, only pausing
 whereon he had last seen Fanny alive.

---
Reaching the town, Troy descended into a side
 street and."

---
Troy was so unlike himself now in look, word, and
 deed,.
---
that the want of likeness was perceptible even to
 his own consciousness
---
His method of engaging himself
 in this business of purchasing a tomb was that of an
 absolutely unpractised man.
---
He could not bring him-
 self to consider, calculate, or economize.
---
He waywardly
 wished for something, and
---
he set about obtaining it like
 a child in a nursery.'
---
" he said to
 the man who stood in a little office within the yard.

---
" I want as good a one,"
.

---
It was all the money he possessed
---
And I want it now at once."

---
" Very well." said Troy, impatiently. 
---
I have in stock
---
Troy then
 settled the account and.
---
He waited in the yard way to Weatherbury,.

---
He carried rather a heavy basket upon his
 occasionally at bridges and gates
---
, whereon he deposited
,

---
the men and the waggon
 the work was done, and,
---
Troy entered Weatherbury churchyard about ten
.
---
as the men had stated
---
Troy deposited his basket beside the tomb, and
.
---
When he returned he
 the light of which he
 directed for a few moments upon the marble,
---
whilst he
 read the inscription
---
He hung his lantern on the lowest
 bough of the yew- tree, and.
---
Troy laid these out upon the grass, and with an im-
 passive face set to work to plant them.
---
Troy, in his prostration at this time, had no percep-
 tion that in the futility of these romantic doings, dictated
 by a remorseful reaction from previous indifference, there
.
---
Deriving his idiosyn-
 crasies from both sides of the Channel, he showed at
 such junctures as the present the inelasticity of the
 Englishman, together with that blindness to the line
 where sentiment verges on mawkishness, characteristic
 of the French.

---
the rays from Troy's lantern spread into the two old
 yews with a strange illuminating power, flickering, as it
 seemed, up to the black ceiling of cloud above.
---
He
 felt a large drop of rain upon the back of his hand, and

---
Troy was weary and
---
to increase, he resolved.
---
He groped along the wall and over the graves
 in the dark.

---
till he found himself round at the north side
---
Here he entered the porch, and,
---
that nothing on earth could be more hideous
 than those he saw on the north side
---
until he went
 round to the south
---
Troy slept on in the porch, and
---
his shoulders felt stiff his feet tender, and his head
 heavy
---
He remembered his position,.

---
He entered the gravel path which would take him
 behind the tower.
---
he saw

---
He picked it up--?
---
surely it could
 not be one of the primroses he had planted
---
He saw
 a bulb, another, and another as he advanced.
---
Troy turned the corner and.

---
The disturbed
 earth was washed over the grass and pathway in the
 guise of the brown mud he had already seen, and
---
Troy's brow became.
---
He set his
 teeth closely, and
---
his compressed lips moved as those of
 one in great pain.
---
This singular accident, by a strange
 confluence of emotions in him, was felt as the sharpest
 sting of all.
---
Troy's face was very expressive, and
---
who had seen him now
---
him to be a man who had laughed, and sung,
 and poured love- trifles into a woman's ear
---
To curse
 his miserable lot was at first his impulse, but
---
even that
 lowest stage of rebellion needed an activity whose
 absence was necessarily antecedent to the existence of the
 morbid misery which wrung him.
---
it was more than he could endure.

---
Sanguine by nature, Troy had a power of eluding
 grief by simply adjourning it.
---
He could put off the
 consideration of any particular spectre till the matter
.
---
as if his intention had been known and
---
as he stood

---
Almost for the first time in his life, Troy, by this dismantled grave, wished himself another man.

---
that the fact of his life being his own is the one
 qualification which singles it out as a more hopeful life
 than that of others who may actually resemble him in
 every particular
---
Troy had felt, in his transient way,
 hundreds of times,.
---
that he could not envy other people
 their condition,
---
when he
 desired no other than his own
---
He had not minded
 the peculiarities of his birth, the vicissitudes of his life,
 the meteorlike uncertainty of all that related to him,
; and
---
because these appertained to the hero of his story,

---
without whom there would have been no story at all for
 him
---
, all of a
 sudden, Troy hated himself.
---
He stood and a miserable man.
---
I can warrant them
" Well, I could add the name, and. should he go?"
---
He that is accursed, let..
---
him be accursed
 still
---
A man spent his primal strength in journeying in one direction
.
---
has not much spirit left for reversing his course
---
Troy
 had, since yesterday, faintly reversed his; but
---
the merest
 opposition had disheartened him.
---
that he might adopt one
---
that Providence, far from
 helping him into a new course, or showing any wish
, actually jeered his first trembling
 and critical attempt in that kind
---
He slowly withdrew from the grave.
---
He simply threw up his cards and
 forswore his game for that time and always.
---
Going out
 of the churchyard silently and unobserved---- he passed down some fields
 at the back, and.
---
Shortly afterwards he had gone from the village.

---
The light
 of Troy's lantern in the churchyard was noticed about
 ten o'clock by the maid- servant, who casually glanced
 from the window in that direction whilst taking her
 supper, and
---
He's now gone on."

---
" Oh! Gabriel has been here this morning!"

---
he had left off lately
---
Has Mr. Troy been in to- night?
---
he's gone to Budmouth
---
he has gone there
---
Laban Tall saw him on the Budmouth road this
 morning before breakfast."

---
the men having returned to work again from their
 first meal
---
just as Troy had seen it and
---
On the other side of the scene stood Gabriel.

---
His eyes, too, were fixed on the tomb, and
---
Then
 her eye followed Oak's, and
---
Oak saw her, and
---
his first act was.
---
Whilst
 Oak was doing
---
who
 lay in the churchyard, remorse, and a general averseness
 to his wife's society,
---
The sad accessories
 of Fanny's end confronted him as vivid pictures which
 threatened to be indelible, and made life in Bathsheba's
 house intolerable.
---
At three in the afternoon he found
 himself at the foot of a slope more than a mile in length,
 which ran to the ridge of a range of hills lying parallel
 with the shore, and forming a monotonous barrier between
 the basin of cultivated country inland and the wilder
 scenery of the coast.
---
Troy toiled up the road with a languor and depression
 greater than any he had experienced for many a day
 and year before.
---
as he approached
---
At last he reached the summit, and
---
a wide and
 novel prospect burst upon him with an effect almost like
 that of the Pacific upon Balboa's gaze.
---
The broad
 steely sea, stretched the
 whole width of his front and round to the right, where,
 near the town and port of Budmouth, the sun bristled
 down upon it, and banished all colour, to substitute in
 its place a clear oily polish.
---
He descended and.
---
Troy's nature freshened within
 him
---
; he thought.
---
he would rest and
---
He undressed and.
---
, Troy presently swam between the two projecting

---
Unfortunately for Troy
 a current unknown to him existed outside, which, un-
 important to craft of any burden,.
---
Troy
 found.

---
himself carried to the left and then round in a
 swoop out to sea
---
He now recollected the place and its sinister
 character.
---
Troy began.
---
that he might be added to their number
---
After wellnigh exhausting himself in attempts
 to get back to the mouth of the cove, in his weakness
 swimming several inches deeper than was his wo nt,
 keeping up his breathing entirely by his nostrils, turning
 upon his back a dozen times over, swimming EN PAPILLON
 and so on
---
, Troy resolved as a last resource to tread
 water at a slight incline, and
---
This, necessarily a slow process, he
 found, and though there
 was no choice of a landing- place-- the objects on shore
 passing by him in a sad and slow procession
---
-- he per-

---
While the swimmer's eye's were
 fixed upon the spit as his only means of salvation on
 this side of the Unknown
---
All Troy's vigour spasmodically revived.
---
Swimming with his
 right arm, he held up his left.
---
From
 the position of the setting sun his white form was
 distinctly visible upon the now deep- hued bosom of the
 sea to the east of the boat, and
---
the men saw him at
 once.
---
Backing their oars and putting the boat about,
 they pulled towards him with a will, and
---
in five or six
 minutes from the time of his first halloo, two of the
 sailors hauled him in over the stern.

---
Soon, or later--
 and that not very late-- her husband would be home
 again.
---
the peculiar nature of her uncle's will, his own
 frequent testimony before his death to her cleverness
 in such a pursuit, and her vigorous marshalling of the
 numerous flocks and herds, had won
 confidence in her powers, and
---
only one point was clear-- that
 in the event of her own or her husband's inability to
 meet the agent at the forthcoming January rent- day,
 very little consideration would be shown, and, for that
 matter, very little would be deserved
---
though her back
 was towards him

---
" I am looking for Mrs. Troy." Yes; that's the young lady
---
" Yes; that's the young lady, I believe." I have some awkward news to break to her. Her
 husband is drowned."

---
A gloomy man,, stepped quickly to her side at the moment of
 her exclamation, and.

---
said Boldwood,.

---
as he supported her
---
" Her husband was drowned this week.
---
A coastguardsman found his clothes,
 and."

---
Thereupon a strange fire lighted up Boldwood's eye,
 and
---
his face flushed with the suppressed excitement of
 an unutterable thought.
---
He
 lifted her bodily off the ground, and.

---
Here he passed with her under the archway into a
 private room; and
---
he had deposited
---
Remembering all,
," I want!"

---
Boldwood left the room.
---
He stood for a moment in
 the passage to recover his senses.
---
for his consciousness to keep up with,
 and
---
now that he had grasped it
---
; he had been close to hers.

---
He started onward again, and
---
what he had already
 heard
---
He then ordered her horse, and
---
He found that, though still pale and unwell, she had in
 the meantime sent for the Budmouth man who brought
 the tidings, and learnt from him all there was to know.

---
" Because he's still alive."

---
which,
 beyond making by a methodizing pen formidable pre-
 sumptive evidence of Troy's death by drowning, con-
 tained the important testimony of a young Mr. Barker,
 M.D., of Budmouth, who spoke to being an eyewitness
 of the accident, in a letter to the editor
---
In this he
 stated.
---
that he was passing over the cliff on the remoter
 side of the cove
---
At that
 time he saw a bather carried along in the current outside
 the mouth of the cove, and.
---
that
 there was but a poor chance for him
---
unless he should
 be possessed of unusual muscular powers
---
He drifted
 behind a projection of the coast, and
---
But by the time
 that he could reach an elevation sufficiently great to
 command a view of the sea beyond
---
The other circumstance was the arrival of his clothes,
.
---
though this had virtually been done long before
 by those who inspected the letters in his pockets
---
that
 Troy had undressed in the full conviction of dressing
 again almost immediately,
---
that anything
 but death could have prevented him
---
that Troy had followed Fanny
 into another world
---
Had he done this intentionally, yet
?

---
his death appear like an accident
---
he had shown that night
 
---
as he had opened it before her a week ago
---
He was hers and
---
that he was not hers
 still
---
However, one excellent result of her general apathy
 was the long- delayed installation of Oak as bailiff; but

---
he having virtually exercised that function for a long
 time already,.

---
Boldwood lived.
---
Much of
 his wheat and all his barley of that season had been
 spoilt by the rain.
---
it was elicited from one of
 Boldwood's men that forgetfulness had nothing to do
 with it, for he had been reminded of the danger to
 his corn as many times and as persistently as inferiors
 dared to do.
---
he one evening sent for Oak.
---
that Gabriel
 should undertake the superintendence of the Lower
 Farm as well as of Bathsheba's, because of the necessity

---
Boldwood felt for such aid, and the impossibility of
 discovering a more trustworthy man.
---
Gabriel's malig-
 nant star was assuredly setting fast.

---
that the two farms together
 were too extensive for the observation of one man
---
Boldwood,, suggested.
---
that Oak
 should be furnished with a horse for his sole use,

---
Oak mounted on a strong cob, and daily trotting
 the length breadth of about two thousand acres
 in a cheerful spirit of surveillance, as if the crops
 belonged to him--
---
Out of this there arose, during the spring succeeding,
 a talk in the parish that Gabriel Oak was feathering his
 nest fast.

---
He now wears.
---
that Gabriel, though paid
 a fixed wage by Bathsheba independent of the fluctua-
 tions of agricultural profits,, yet
---
by which Oak was
---
for though his condition had thus far improved
---
to consider Oak a" near" man,
, he
 lived in no better style than before,.
---
as Oak was not only provokingly
 indifferent to public opinion, but a man who clung
 persistently to old habits and usages
---
But,, there was room for doubt as to his
 motives.

---
A great hope had latterly germinated in Boldwood,
.
---
This fevered hope had grown up
 again like a grain of mustard- seed during the quiet
 which followed the hasty conjecture that Troy was
 drowned.
---
He nourished it fearfully, and
---
her
 appearance was in itself a weekly addition to his faith
---
when his waiting on events should have
 its reward
---
How long he might have
---
he had

---
what he would try
---
he trusted.
---
, that
 man would be himself
---
Such was Boldwood's hope.

---
Boldwood contrived to

---
he said
.

---
why he
" I hope
---
Mrs. Troy is quite well
---
" Mrs Troy puts much confidence in you, Lydia,
 and very wisely, perhaps."

---
Mr. Troy's
 going and all
---
said
 the strategic lover, throbbing throughout him at the
 presumption which Liddy's words appeared to warrant
 -- of re- marriage.

---
that his darling had thought
---
how very stupid Mr. Boldwood was getting
---
he returned hastily,.
---
his hope falling
 again
---
" Not I." said Boldwood,."
---
Mr,
 Oak says.
---
He went away vexed with himself, and ashamed of
 having for this one time in his life done anything which
 could be called underhand.
---
Poor Boldwood had no
 more skill in finesse than a battering- ram, and
---
he was
 uneasy with a sense of having made himself to appear
 stupid and.
---
But he had,.
---
This pleasant notion was now continually in his mind.

---
he had for
---
Jacob had served twice seven years for
 Rachel: what were six for such a woman as this?
---
He
 tried.
---
Boldwood felt his love
,.
---
He would annihilate
 the six years of his life-- so little

---
did he value his time on earth beside her love.
---
He
 would let all those six years of intangible ether-
 eal courtship
---
, how little care he had for anything but.

HIS WIFE'S HAND


 GREENHILL was the Nijni Novgorod of South
 Wessex; and
---
The shepherd of each flock marched behind,
 a bundle containing his kit for the week strapped upon
 his shoulders, and in his hand his crook, which he used
 as the staff of his pilgrimage.
---
Men were shouting,

---
I am now going on a little farther." The Royal Hippodrome Performance of Turpin's
 Ride to York and the Death of Black Bess." replied the
 man promptly, without turning his eyes or leaving off
 trying.

---
These were so convinced by such genuine appeals to
 heart and understanding both that they soon began to
 crowd in abundantly, among the foremost being visible
 Jan Coggan and Joseph Poorgrass, who were holiday
 keeping here to- day,
"' That's the great ruffen pushing me!"
---
pushing ye said Coggan, in a deprecating tone, turning
 without turning his body,.

---
in which Coggan
 and Poorgrass were again thrust by those behind upon
 the women in front
---
Now." said Coggan,.
---
if I
 could only get out of this cheesewring
---
implored Joseph
 Poorgrass, in a whisper.
---
They might get their men to
 murder us,."

---
for I think by the shine of their eyes
---
Jan held his tongue,, and
---
as if he had no objection to be

---
Poorgrass being flattened like a
 jumping- jack, and
---
which he
 had got ready half- an- hour earlier
---
who
 took the money of him
---
whom we
 instantly recognise as Sergeant Troy
---
Troy's appearance in this position may be briefly
 accounted for.
---
aboard which he was taken in

---
Troy read the articles and
, but
---
as he had half expected
---
was despatched
 across the bay to Lulwind cove;,
 his clothes were gone.
---
He ultimately worked his passage
 to the United States, where he made a precarious living
 in various towns as Professor of Gymnastics, Sword
 Exercise, Fencing, and Pugilism.
---
There was a certain animal form of refinement in his
 nature; and
---
that he could claim a
 home and
---
its comforts did he but
---
To England he did return at last; but
---
his intention to enter his old groove at
 the place became.
---
if he were
---
that to go home
 his reception would be of a kind very unpleasant to con-
 template;
---
what Troy had in the way of emotion
---
which sometimes caused
 him as much inconvenience as emotion of a strong and
 healthy kind
---
how
 could he endure existence with a spirited wife to whom
 at first entering he would be beholden for food and
 lodging?
---
he would then become liable for her
 maintenance:  and what a life
---
Thus, for reasons touching on distaste, regret,
 and shame commingled, he put off his return from day
 to day, and.

---
if he could have found anywhere else the ready- made
 establishment which existed for him there
---
At this time-- the July preceding the September in
-- he fell in with a
 travelling circus which was performing in the outskirts of
 a northern town.
---
Troy introduced himself to the
 manager by taming a restive horse of the troupe, hitting
 a suspended apple with pistol-- bullet fired from the
 animal's back when in full gallop, and other feats.
---
Troy was taken into
 the company, and the play of Turpin.
---
Troy
 was not greatly elated by the appreciative spirit in which
 he was undoubtedly treated, but
---
he thought.

---
that Troy found himself
 at Greenhill Fair with the rest of the company on this
 day
---
who was driven to the fair that day
 by her odd man Poorgrass
---
that Mr. Francis, the
 Great Cosmopolitan Equestrian and Roughrider, would
 enact the part of Turpin
---
I hope
---
"
 he said, nervously.

---
He was looking at this large tent and the announcement.

---
Turpin was a real man
---
, was he not?"

---
Jan Coggan say that a relation of his knew
 Tom King, Turpin's friend, quite well
---
" Coggan is rather given to strange stories connected
 with his relations
---
" Yes, yes; we know Coggan.
---
, he added,"
---
that Oak
 might appear,,
---
Oak was nowhere
; and
---
Troy, on peeping from his dressing- tent through a
 slit for a reconnoitre before entering, saw his unconscious
 wife on high before him as described,.
---
He started back in utter confusion,
.
---
although his disguise effectually concealed his person-
 ality
---
for, he instantly felt
---
He had several times during the day thought
 of the possibility of some Weatherbury person or other
 appearing and recognizing him; but
---
he had taken the
 risk carelessly.
---
, let them, he had said.

---
the
 reality of the scene was so much intenser than any of
 his prefigurings that he felt he had not half enough
.

---
He had not
 expected.
---
Should he go on, and?

---
He could not bring himself.
---
Beyond a politic
 wish to remain unknown, there suddenly arose in him
 now a sense of shame at the possibility that his
 attractive young wife, who already despised him, should
 despise him more by discovering him in so mean a
 condition after so long a time.
---
He actually blushed
 at the thought, and was vexed beyond measure that
 his sentiments of dislike towards Weatherbury should
 have led him to dally about the country in this way.

---
But Troy was never more clever than when absolutely
 at his wit's end.
---
He hastily thrust aside the curtain
 dividing his own little dressing space from that of the
 manager and proprietor, who now appeared as the
 individual called Tom King as far down as his waist, and
 as the aforesaid respectable manager thence to his toes.

---
" said Troy.

---
I do n't
 want.
---
if I open my mouth
---
, I think.
---
" I ca n't."

---
that he'll perform it just
 the same without speaking."

---
The proprietor shook his head.

---
" Anyhow, play or no play, I wo n't open my mouth,

---
said Troy, firmly.

---
I tell you."
---
said the other, who perhaps felt it would be
 extremely awkward to offend his leading man just at
 this time.
---
, hotly
 pursued at midnight by the officers, and half- awake
 gatekeeper in his tasselled nightcap
---
I wo n't tell'em anything about your
 keeping silence At the turnpike scene denies, Coggan uttered!", and
---
Poorgrass smiled delightedly
 with a nice sense of dramatic contrast between our
 hero, who coolly leaps the gate, and halting justice in
 the form of his enemies, who must needs pull up
 cumbersomely and wait to be let through.
---
At the
 death of Tom King, he could not refrain from seizing
 Coggan by the hand, and whispering, with tears in his
 eyes," Of course he's not really shot, Jan --  only
 seemingly!"
---
nothing could restrain Poorgrass
 from lending a hand, exclaiming, as he asked Jan to
 join him
---
For
 many a year in Weatherbury, Joseph told, with the air
 of a man who had had experiences in his time,.
---
that he
 touched with his own hand the hoof of Bess
---
Meanwhile Troy had added a few touches to his
 ordinary make- up for the character, the more effectually
, and.
---
though he had felt faint qualms
 on first entering
---
, the metamorphosis ously" lining" his face with a wire
---
Nevertheless, he
 was relieved.

---
Troy had taken his part very
 quietly this time,; and
---
venturing to introduce a few speeches
 on occasion was just concluding it when, whilst
 standing at the edge of the circle contiguous to the first
 row of spectators, he observed within a yard of him.
---
the
 eye of a man darted keenly into his side features
---
Troy
 hastily shifted his position, after having recognized in
 sworn enemy, who still hung about the outskirts of

---
That he had been recognized by

---
this man was highly probable
---
he had felt to

---
that knowledge of his present occupation would
 discredit him still further in his wife's eyes
---
Then the great objection allowing news of his proximity to precede him to
 Weatherbury in the event of his return, based on a
 feeling, returned
 in full force.
---
Moreover, should he resolve not to
 return at all, a tale of his being alive and being in
; and
---
he was
 anxious to acquire a knowledge of his wife's temporal
 affairs before deciding which to do.

---
In this dilemma Troy at once went out to recon-

---
It occurred to him.
---
He had put on a thick beard borrowed from the
 establishment, and this he wandered about the fair-
 field.
---
as he was
 jauntily called by the local newspaper
---
as if he had never lived anywhere but under canvas
 all his life
---
Troy stood at the entrance to the booth, where a
 gipsy- woman was frying pancakes over a little fire of
 sticks and selling them at a penny a- piece, and looked
 over the heads of the people within.
---
He could see
 nothing of Pennyways, but
---
he soon discerned Bathsheba
 through an opening into the reserved space at the
 further end.
---
Troy thereupon retreated
---
He could hear
 Bathsheba's voice immediately inside the canvas
---
He wondered.
---
To get at the root of
 the matter, Troy took a penknife from his pocket and
 which,
 by folding back the corners left a hole the size of a
 wafer.
---
Close to this he placed his face,
---
He made
 another hole a little to one side and lower down, in a
 shaded place beside her chair, from which it was easy
 and safe to survey her by looking horizontally'.

---
Troy took in the scene completely now.
---
the owner of the male voice was Boldwood,
; and
---
he was obliged.

---
as he gazed in
---
Troy found unexpected chords of feeling to be stirred
 again within him as they had been stirred earlier in the
 day.
---
before he could counteract his sudden

---
Then he thought
---
who had always looked down upon him

---
Were he
---
himself known
---
to make
, that chapter of his life must at all risks
 be kept for ever from her and from the Weatherbury
 people, or.
---
his name would be a byword throughout the
 parish
---
He would be nicknamed" Turpin" as long as
 he lived.
---
Assuredly before he could claim her these few
 past months of his existence.

---
" Shall I get you another cup,
 ma'am?
---
" said Farmer Boldwood.

---
I thank you
---
It was great neglect in that man.
---
if it had not been for him
---
Troy scrutinized her cheek,
 and, and the
 white shell- like sinuosities of her little ear.
---
Troy trembled: .
---
He was about
, and.

---
when
 he was arrested by the conversation
---
he was
 too late
---
" Excuse me, ma'am." said Pennyways;.
---
" I've some
 private information for your ear alone
---
I can not hear it now.
---
this man was evident
---
; in
 fact, he was continually coming to her with some tale
 or other, by which he might creep into favour at the
 expense of persons maligned.

---
said Pennyways, confidently.
---
He
 stooped over the table,.
---
" YOUR husband is here
---
I've seen him.
---
This he folded small, and.

---
though he had not been able to see what the ex- bailiff
 wrote
---
that the note referred
 to him
---
that he could think of
---
" he whispered,
 and.
---
Meanwhile Boldwood said,?
---
If not,
 I'll destroy it."

---
He wants, or
---
me to recommend him
---
He's always doing that."

---
The moment had come for saving his game,
 and
---
Troy impulsively felt, and
---
that he would play the card,
 For yet another time he looked at the fair hand, and

---
the blue veins of the
 wrist,: how familiar it all was to him!
---
in which he was such an adept
---
Then, with
 the lightning action, he
 noiselessly slipped his hand under the bottom of the
 tent- cloth, which was far from being pinned tightly down,

---
Troy then slid down on the outside of the rampart,
.
---
His object was now.

---
as he should choose
---
Troy reached the tent door, and.
---
One or two men were speaking of
 a daring attempt that had just been made to rob a
 young lady by lifting the canvas of the tent beside her.

---
that the rogue had imagined a slip of
 paper which she held in her hand to he a bank note,

---
for he had seized it, and
---
His chagrin and disappointment at dis-
 covering its worthlessness would be a good joke
---
the four bowed old men with grim countenances and
 walking- sticks in hand,
---
Troy glided up to him,
---
with a mutual glance of
 concurrence the two men went into the night together.





---
that Oak should take the place of Poor-
 grass in Bathsheba's conveyance and
---
that Joseph
 was suffering from his old complaint, a multiplying eye,
 and
---
But Oak had found himself, and.
---
many times done from Casterbridge Market, and trust
 to her good angel for performing the journey un-

---
Boldwood assured
 her.

---
since he
 was her own managing- man and servant
---
Boldwood mounted his horse, and.
---
who
 so persistently loved on to his own injury and per-
 manent gloom
---
Hence her pity for the man had betrayed Bathsheba into an injudi-
 cious considerateness of manner, which appeared
 almost like tenderness, and gave new vigour to the
 exquisite dream of a Jacob's seven years service in
 poor Boldwood's mind.

---
He soon found an excuse for advancing from his
 position in the rear, and.
---
when Boldwood said suddenly
 and simply--
" Mrs. Troy,
---
Yet your late husband
 has been dead nearly one year, and
---
that his death was never and
---
A man saw.
---
him drowning, too
---
No
 reasonable person has any doubt of his death; nor

---
the creaks of
 Boldwood's saddle and gig springs were all.
---
Boldwood ended the pause.

---
Every
 dog has his day
---
before HE was anything, and
---
Boldwood pleaded.
---
My husband
 may be living,.
---
His tone was so excited that she almost feared him
 at this moment, even whilst she sympathized.
---
as I said"
" Of course, I'll drop the subject. I am a
 middle- aged man, willing to protect you for the
 remainder of our lives. But I ca n't help Had n't
 I the first place beside you?-- you
 have taken me so by surprise--"
" But
---
if my husband should not come back
---
He said nothing further
---
till he
 added: "
---
Well, I'll say no more to you about it till that
 time."

---
He'll never forget you,
 ma'am,
---
what Boldwood had asked her, and
---
how he was ex-

---
that, he'll go out
 of his mind
---
" said Gabriel, gravely.

---
" I believe this.
---
I say it in a spirit
---
"- i believe.
---
I hold that man's future in my
 hand
---
His career depends entirely upon my treatment
 of him.
---
O Gabriel, I tremble at my responsibility,!"

---
" Well, I think this much, ma'am,."
---
as I told you years
 ago
---
said Oak,".

---
that his life is a total blank; but
---
whenever
 he is n't hoping for' ee
---
I ca n't suppose- that nothing so dreadful hangs on to it as you fancy
---
i hope

---
His natural manner has always been dark and strange,

---
I think."

---
I
 would
---
I do want and long
---
And
 six years-- why we may all be in our graves by that
 BATHSHEBA TALKS WITH OAK
 time,!
---
even if Mr. Troy does not come back again,
---
which
 he may not impossibly do
---
Now, is n't it preposterous,
 Gabriel?
---
However he came to dream of it
---
, I can not think.

---
" Perhaps it would be an uncommon agreement for a
 man and woman to make:  I do n't see anything really
 wrong about it."
---
said Oak, slowly.
---
In fact the very
 thing to marry en
 under any condition, that is, your not caring about him
 --
---
for I may suppose-- --"

---
Love is an utterly bygone, sorry, worn-
 out, miserable thing with me-- for him or any one else."

---
" Well, your want of love seems to me the one thing
 that takes away harm from such an agreement with him.

---
to do wi' it, making ye long to over-
 come the awkwardness about your husband's vanishing,
 it mid be wrong; but
---
a cold- hearted agreement to oblige
 a man seems different, somehow.
---
The real sin, ma'am
 in my mind, lies in thinking of ever wedding wi' a man
."

---
, he would never have wanted.

---
When a
 rake gambles away his expectations, the fact does n't make him the less liable.

---
that in the
 eye of the law my husband is
---
that my own scruples, and the fact only missing, will keep
 any man from marrying me
---
what I can-
 that I once seriously injured
 him in sheer idleness If I had never played a trick
 upon him O if I could only pay some heavy damages in money
 to him for the harm I did, and I believe I am
. I've been a rake, and I ask you sidering until seven years have
 passed-- am I free to entertain such an idea, even
 though' tis a sort of penance--?
---
that your husband is
 dead
---
" I shall get to, I suppose, because I can not help
 feeling what would have brought him back long before
 this time if he had lived." Well, then, in religious sense you will be as free
 to THINK o' marrying again as any real widow of one
 year's standing.
---
But why do n't ye ask Mr. Thirdly's
 advice on how to treat Mr. Boldwood?"

---
said
 Oak, with a grave smile.

---
Oak had not once
 wished her free that he might marry her himself--
---
I could wait for you as well as he
---
was n't Gabriel far too poor a man

---
Yet he might have just
 hinted about that old love of his, and.
---
if he might speak of it
---
Boldwood
 was
---
that
 Boldwood should be the giver.
---
The log
 to form the back- brand of the evening fire
 was the uncleft trunk of a tree, so unwieldy that it could
 be neither brought nor rolled to its place; and accord-
 ingly two men were to be observed dragging and heaving
 it in by chains and levers as the hour of assembly drew
 near.
                      
---
When I want a broad- minded opinion for
 general enlightenment, distinct from special advice, I
 never go to a man who deals in the subject pro-
 fessionally. So I like the parson's opinion on law, the
 lawyer's on doctoring, the doctor's on business, and my
 business- man's-- that is, yours-- on morals."
" I'm afraid there's a hitch in that argument."" That's wicked of you--."

---
to he rejoicing
---
Boldwood was dressing also at this hour.
---
A tailor
 from Casterbridge was with him,.

---
Never had Boldwood been so fastidious, unreasonable
 about the fit, and generally difficult to please.
---
Boldwood was not bored-

---
Times had been, but now no philosophic or
 hasty rebuke whatever was provoked by this man for
 attaching as much importance to a crease in the coat
 as to an earthquake in South America.
---
Boldwood at
 last expressed himself nearly satisfied, and.

---
just as Oak came in

---
" Oh, Oak." said Boldwood.
---
I shall of course see
 you here to- night.
---
I am deter-

---
" I'll try, sir,."
---
said Gabriel, quietly.
---
" I am glad indeed
."

---
" Yes- i must own it-
---
i am bright to- night:  cheerful
 and more than cheerful- so much so that I am almost
 sad again with the sense that all of it is passing away.

---
when I am excessively hopeful and
 blithe
---
so that I
 often get, and

---
- i feel
.
---
" I hope it' ill."

---
And yet I trust my hope.

---
I think this time I reckon with
 my host.
---
; I ca n't tie this neckerchief properly.
---
I have not been well
 lately,
---
" I am sorry to hear that, sir."

---
I want,
 please.
---
" I do n't know, sir."
---
said Oak.
---
His tone had sunk to
 sadness.

---
Boldwood approached Gabriel, and
---
as Oak tied the
 neckerchief the farmer went on feverishly--

---
" I wo n't answer for her implying."
---
said Oak, with
 faint bitterness.
---
to have shifted our
 positions: I have become the young and hopeful man,
 and you the old and unbelieving one.
---
" I am afeard.

---
I think it will soon--
.
---
yes, I know
---
" he said, in an impulsive whisper.

---
" I have pressed her upon the subject, and
---
How
 can I expect more?
---
he said, with im-
 patience.
---
since he vanished
---
Never!" said Boldwood, vehemently.

---
IV
 Troy was sitting in a corner of The White Hart
 tavern at Casterbridge, smoking and drinking a steaming
 mixture from a glass.
---
Pennyways entered.

---
" Well, have you seen him?"
---
Troy inquired,.
" Boldwood?"

---
I went there first, too."

---
"' Tis rather, I suppose.
---
" Yet I do n't see that,
---
because a man appears
---
to be
 drowned and was not, he should be liable for anything.

---
I sha n't ask any lawyer-- not I."

---
If a man changes his
 name and so forth, and
---
takes steps to deceive the world
 and his own wife, he's a cheat, and
---
Troy had laughed,
 but
---
it was with some anxiety that he said," Now, what
 I want to know is this
---
Upon
 my soul, I should never have believed it!
---
" I haen't been able to learn.
---
There's a deal of
 feeling on his side seemingly, but
---
I do n't answer for
 her.
---
I did n't know a word about any such thing till
 yesterday, and
---
I heard then
---
, I know.
---
" I'm not so sure of that....
---
when I set eyes upon her that day

---
I wondered.
---
what I could have been made of
---
And then I was
 hampered with that bothering show, which I'm free of
."
---
He smoked on awhile, and

---
far's I know
---
much as if
 I'd been no more than a leafless tree
---
I'll make some cider- wine."
---
" I must go and
---
O yes, I see
.
---
that- i must go
---
Oak is head man still
---
, is n't he?"

---
He manages everything."

---
" Twill puzzle him, or any other man
 of his compass!"

---
" I do n't know about that.
---
well he's pretty independent
---
And she've a few soft corners to her mind, though
 I've never been able to get into one, the devil's in't!"

---
looking into, I perceive.

---
What with one thing and another, I see."
                    
---
" How do I look to- night, Liddy?"
---
" Everybody will think captivate Mr. Boldwood
---
Mr. Boldwood should ask you
 --
---
it-- to run away with him,
---
VI
" Oak, said Boldwood,".
---
shall, why-- --"
 said Oak, hastily.
---
I
 would advise you-."

---
i know
---
I know
---
", I know.
---
I have
---
But the feeling about in-
 creasing your share is on account of what I know of you
 Oak,
---
I have learnt a little about your secret
---
But you have behaved like a man, and
---
I, as a
 sort of successful rival- successful partly through your
 goodness of heart-- should like definitely."

---
said Oak,
 hurriedly.
---
I must get used to such as that
---
"; other
 men have, and.
---
so shall I."
 Oak then left him
---
He was uneasy on Boldwood's
 account,.

---
for he saw anew
---
he once had

---
him not the man been
---
As Boldwood continued awhile in his room alone
---
--
 ready and dressed to receive his company-- the mood of
 anxiety about his appearance seemed, and
.
---
He looked out
 of the window, and and
---
Then he went to a locked closet, and.
---
But
 he lingered.
---
Boldwood's eyes dwelt upon its many sparkles a long
 time,.

---
though that its material aspect concerned him

---
little was plain from his manner and mien, which were
 those of a mind following out the presumed thread of
 that jewel's future history
---
Boldwood closed the box,.

---
who was his indoor factotum
---
The old man came at the
 same moment to the foot of the stairs.

---
" I was coming down this moment.
---
I
 heard
---
Those wheels-- is it Mrs. Troy?"
" No, sir--' tis not she yet."

---
A reserved and sombre expression had returned to
 Boldwood's face again, but
---
it poorly cloaked his feel-
 ings; and
---
when he pronounced Bathsheba's name
---
his
 feverish anxiety continued.
                   
---
as he went down the stairs
---
said Troy to Pennyways,

---
, I'm sure."

---
He was buttoning on a heavy grey overcoat of
 Noachian cut, with cape and high collar, the latter being
 erect and rigid, like a girdling wall, and.

---
which was pulled down
 over his ears
---
Pennyways snuffed the candle, and
---
he
 said.

---
Yes; of course I have."

---
if I was you
---
Faith, I'd even bide-- a single man of the name of Francis.
---
I've been called a
 long- headed feller here and there."

---
" All nonsense!" said Troy, angrily.
---
But what man on earth was!"

---
if he has her there
---
Pennyways now felt.
---
himself to be in something of a
 difficulty,
---
if he would secure the patronage of her husband
---
he said, as a saving sentence."
---
, I'll do."

---
I expect I shall not be a very welcome
 guest." when I go in
, I felt an
 awful shudder just then! A stick- i must have a walking- stick."
 I
 sometimes think, and."" Now, let." said Troy,.'
---
as he stood
---
I shall not hurry along the road, and

---
OUTSIDE the front of Boldwood's house a group of
 men stood in the dark, with their faces towards the door,
.

---
" He was seen in Casterbridge this afternoon--
---
so the
 boy said.
---
His body was never found,.
---
" Perhaps he do n't mean.
---
" said another
 man.

---
If he's alive and here in the neighbourhood
---
", he
 means mischief.
---
He'll drag her to the dogs."

---
I do" O no; he'll settle down quiet enough."
---
what
 the man was made of
---
He peered into their faces.

---
Sergeant Troy being seen, d'ye
 mean
---
" Yes, I have. I do n't think it. Laban
 comes himself,' a b'lieve."
---
every man busied with his
 own thoughts, during which interval sounds of merri-
 ment
---
the wellknown form of
 Boldwood was seen in the rectangular area of light, and
---
Boldwood walked slowly down the path.

---
one of the men whispered,.
---
as he neared
 them
---
"-- he'll go in again
 directly.
---
He would think it unseemly o' us to be
 loitering here.

---
Boldwood came on, and
---
passed by the men without
 seeing them
---
He paused, leant over the gate, and breathed a long
 breath.
---
low words come from him
---
He said this to himself, and
---
Boldwood remained silent after that, and
---
Boldwood hastened back to the door, and
---
Boldwood compressed his emotion to mere welcome:

---
the men marked her light laugh and apology
---
: he took her into the house; and
---
" Gracious heaven, I did n't know!"
---
it was like that with
 him
---
said one of the men.
---
that fancy of
 his was over long ago
---
Troy was in -- -- 
---
since he
 came here
---
when, pausing, he turned suddenly to his companions
 and
---
Troy's face was almost close to the
 pane, and
---
he was looking in.
---
Not only was he looking in,
 but
---
he appeared.

---
to have been arrested by a conversation
 which was in progress in the malt- house, the voices of
 the interlocutors being those of Oak and the maltster
---
I would n't he should know. I wish." I wish And now I've no heart to go in. hey?" said
 the old man."
---
Although he made?"

---
" I can not say."
---
I can not understand

---
Farmer Boldwood being such a fool at his time of life
,
 and
---
The men, after recognizing Troy's features, withdrew
 across the orchard as quietly as they had come.
---
" It gave me quite a turn-- his face." Tall,
 breathing.
"
---
William ought
---
He's
 oldest."

---
Why, he'll go on
 to her himself in a few minutes,."

---
that he will
---
" Very well, if I must I must, I suppose." What must I say?" O no; I sha n't speak to Mr. Boldwood. If I tell
 anybody,' twill be mistress."

---
When he opened it

---
as he closed it
 again
---
Each man waited intently, and.
---
as if he took
 interest in the scene
---
where
 he started from and
---
So the men entered the hall, which was the room
 selected and arranged for the gathering because of its
 size.
---
The younger men and maids were at last.
---
" he said.
---
", I should like."
---
what he was about to say
---
I can walk home, and
---
" I've been trying."
---
to get an opportunity of speaking
 to you said Boldwood.
---
he said, eagerly.

---
I do n't
 want or.
---
Boldwood
 knew;
 but
---
he had proved."
---
" I feel."
---
that I do
---
, said Boldwood.

---
There is considerable doubt of his death, and
---
he begged in
 a husky voice, unable to sustain the forms of mere
 friendship any longer."
---
If he does not return
---
Boldwood had come close to her side, and
---
now he
 clasped one of her hands in both his own, and.

---
what he held
---
Do n't insist, Mr. Boldwood-- do n't!"

---
he said more quietly, but still

---
And Boldwood slipped the ring on her finger.

---
" I can not wear it.
---
though Boldwood kept her hand
 yet
---
Boldwood pressed her hand, and.
---
"" he said.
---
He left the room, and
---
when he thought
---
Boldwood was standing by the fireplace,
 and
---
he, too, though so absorbed in visions arising from
 her promise that he scarcely saw anything, seemed at
 that moment to have observed their peculiar manner,
 and their looks askance.

---
"" he said.

---
" Mrs. Troy has come downstairs."
---
One of
 the men opened it instantly, and.

---
" Mrs. Troy is wanted."
---
he said, on returning.

---
said the man by the door.

---
" Ask him to come in." said Boldwood.

---
as we have seen him
---
Troy, wrapped up to
 his eyes, stood in the doorway.

---
that he
 was in the neighbourhood
---
Those recognized him instantly;
 those who did not were perplexed.
---
Boldwood was among those who did not notice that
 he was Troy."
---
he repeated,
 cheerfully," and!"

---
Troy next advanced into the middle of the room,
 took off his cap,.
---
Even then Boldwood did not
 recognize
---
who had once before broken in
 upon his bliss
---
that the impersonator of Heaven's persistent
 irony towards him,, scourged him, and
---
Troy began:
---
to laugh a mechanical laugh Boldwood
 recognized him now.

---
Troy turned to Bathsheba.
---
Then Troy spoke."
---
Troy went across to her.

---
Bathsheba, I come here for
 you!"
 what I say" he said,
 peremptorily.

---
Sudden dispaire had trans-
 formed him.

---
Troy stretched out his hand.
---
This visible dread of
 him seemed, and
---
he seized her arm and
.
---
Whether his grasp pinched her, or

---
whether his mere touch was the'cause
---
In bewilderment they turned their eyes to Boldwood.

---
Boldwood's face of gnashing despair had changed.

---
a frenzied look had gleamed
 in his eye.
---
He had turned quickly,.

---
Troy fell.
---
The distance apart of the two men was
 so small that the charge of shot did not spread in the
 least, but passed like a bullet into his body.
---
He uttered
 a long guttural sigh
---
then his muscles relaxed
---
he lay still.

---
Boldwood was seen through the smoke.
---
he had,
---
Samway his man was the first to see this, and
 in the midst of the general horror darted up to him.

---
Boldwood had already twitched the handkerchief, and

---
Boldwood gasped.

---
Then he broke from Samway,.
---
He put on his hat,
.





---
Here he walked at
 an even, steady pace over Yalbury Hill, along the dead
 level beyond
---
the waving
 lamp- flames only lighted up rows of grey shop- shutters,
 and strips of white paving upon which his step echoed
 as his passed along.
---
He turned to the right, and.
---
Boldwood stepped forward, and.
---
when, after a delay, another man
 came
---
Boldwood entered, and
---
he walked the world no more.

---
Long before this time Weatherbury had been
 thoroughly aroused, and the wild deed which had ter-
 minated Boldwood's merrymaking.
---
when he entered
 the room, which was about five minutes after Boldwood's
 exit
---
the men were bewildered as to what to do.
---
his head pillowed in her
 lap,
---
Troy recumbent in his wife's lap formed now the sole
 spectacle in the middle of the spacious room.

---
when he entered,

---
Mr.
 Boldwood has shot my husband."

---
almost before he had comprehended anything beyond
 the briefest abstract of the event,
---
Oak,
 hurried out of the
 room, saddled a horse and.
---
Not till he had

---
did it occur to him.
---
that he
 would have done better by sending some other man
 on this errand, remaining himself in the house
---
What
 had become of Boldwood?
---
He should have been

---
Was he mad
---
Then how had Troy got there?
---
Where had he come
 from?
---
when he was supposed by many
---
Oak had in some slight measure

---
before he had weighed that information
---
he rode on, in the excitement of these self- inquiries
 when about three miles from Caster-
 bridge, a square- figured pedestrian passing along
 under the dark hedge in the same direction as his
 own.

---
at which the shot was fired
 and that of his entering the house
---
Oak was addition-

---
he then found.

---
that Boldwood had also entered the
 town, and
---
In the meantime the surgeon, having hastened into
 the hall at Boldwood's, found it in darkness and quite
 deserted.
---
He went on to the back of the house,
 where he discovered in the kitchen an old man, of
 whom he made inquiries.

---
him took away to her own house, sir
---
","
 said his informant.

---
her dear husband's
 corpse bide neglected
---
he met
---
"" he said.

---
" I do n't know, sir."
---
When he was brought
 home and
---
Oak entered with the parson at this moment, and

---
anybody in the world may see him now.
---
then
 passed by him
---
where
 Oak and the parson still waited
---
which had been useless in Troy's
 case
---
Oak, finding
 from the bulletins that nothing really dreadful was.
---
The
 groups consisted of a throng of idlers, a party of
 javelin- men, and two trumpeters, and.
---
said Coggan,."
---
" I did."
---
said Poorgrass.
---
" I looked hard at en, as
; and
---
if I would read his very soul
---
there was mercy
 in his eyes-- or."

---
" Well, I hope for the best."
---
said Coggan, though
 bad that must be.
---
However, I sha n't go to the trial,
 and
---
I'd advise the rest of ye that bain't wanted to bide
 away.'

as if he were a show

" The very thing I said this morning." observed Joseph,
" Justice is come

" The very thing I said this morning." observed Joseph,
" Justice is come to weigh him in the balances," I said
 in my reflectious way," and wanting, so
 be it unto him," and."

---
Hear, hear,
 A man ought
---
though the speech
 of some men is rumoured abroad as though by nature
 formed for such
---
That he had been from the time of Greenhill Fair
; but
---
until the fatal Christmas Eve in excited and unusual
 moods was known to those who had been intimate
 with him
---
that there had shown
 in him unequivocal symptoms of the mental derange-
 ment which Bathsheba and Oak, alone of all others
 and
---
each package was labelled" Bathsheba Boldwood.
---
These somewhat pathetic evidences of a mind crazed
 with care and love were the subject of discourse in
 Warren's malt- house when Oak entered from Caster-
 bridge with tidings of the kiln glow shone upon
 it
---
he would do
---
Boldwood,, had pleaded guilty, and

---
that Boldwood had not been morally
 responsible for his later acts
---
for Boldwood had
 never made many friends over the counter
---
The shops
 thought it very natural that a man who, by importing
 direct from the producer, had daringly set aside the
 first great principle of provincial existence, namely
.
---
The prompters were a few merciful
 men who had perhaps too feelingly considered the
 facts latterly unearthed, and
---
At
 that time Gabriel came from Casterbridge Gaol, whither
.
---
he had been, and
---
When past the last
 house he heard a hammering, and
---
he looked back for a moment.
---
Over the chimneys
 he could see the upper part of the gaol entrance, rich
 and glowing in the afternoon sun, and
---
He with-
 drew his eyes quickly, and.

---
when he reached home
---
Gabriel said, wearily."
---
And I'm afraid
 there's no hope.
---
I've been with him more than two
 hours."

---
" Do ye think he REALLY?
---
when he
 did it
---
was out of his mind" said Smallbury.

---
" I ca n't honestly say that I do." Oak replied."
---
Shall I go and?"

---
" No." said Oak.
---
I
 could n't stay in town any longer-- after seeing him too,

---
So Laban--, is n't he?"

---
his life will be spared
---
" said Coggan.

---
at eleven o'clock
 that night  several of the villagers strolled along the
 road to Casterbridge and and nearly all the rest of Bathsheba's men.

---
Gabriel's anxiety was great that Boldwood might be
 saved, even though in his conscience he felt that he
 ought to die
---
; for there had been qualities in the farmer
 which Oak loved.
---
"" said
 Coggan, and
---
" said Gabriel.

---
He's.'
---
" Hurrah!" said Coggan, with a swelling heart.
---
First came the words of
 Troy himself:--
 ERECTED BY FRANCIS TROY
 IN BELOVED MEMORY OF
 FANNY ROBIN,
 WHO DIED OCTOBER9,18--,
 AGED20 YEARS.

---
" A few minutes, ma'am." said Oak, respectfully.

---
" said Gabriel.
---
I am one of the bass singers
---
I have sung bass for several months.

---
" Indeed: I was n't aware of that.
---
I'll leave you, then."
 which I have loved long since, and lost awhile,
.

---
I think."

---
I
 wo n't go in to- night
---
I've not seen you
---
i mean
---
, have I?
---
" But he feared, and?"

---
" said Oak.

---
Gabriel murmured.

---
when he saw the date
---
And to me, and
 I had been dead between.
---
And now I am going home,
 Mr. Oak."

---
Oak walked after her.
---
I wanted.
---
as I could
---
" to name a small
 matter to you as soon" he said, with hesitation.

---
" Merrily about business, and I think."

---
I may just mention it
 now,
---
that I may soon have
---
I am think-

---
Oak stammered out.

---
said Gabriel, in a
 distressed tone.
---
that I feel
---
Good afternoon,
 ma'am" he concluded,.

---
more evidence of his
 want of interest in her was forthcoming.
---
as he had hitherto done during
 her seclusion,
---
that instead of entering the small parlour or office
 and waiting, or
 leaving a memorandum Oak never came at all,
---
Whenever he wanted directions he sent a
 message, or note with neither heading nor signature, to
 which she was obliged to reply in the same off- hand
 style.
---
the event in the hall at Boldwood's-- was
 not agitating her at all; but instead, an agonizing con-
 viction that everybody abjured her-- for what she could
 not tell-- and that Oak was the ringleader of the
 recusants
---
There he was, as usual,.
---
But on seeing, he
 looked aside, and as soon as he got beyond the gate,
 and
---
, he
 made one, and
---
It was a formal notice
 by letter from him that he should not renew his engage-
 ment with her for the following Lady- day.

---
that the
 possession of hopeless love from Gabriel, AFTER ALL
 grown
---
Since Troy's death Oak
 had attended all sales and fairs for her,.
---
although
 he was her manager, and
---
Gabriel
 opened the door, and
---
the moon shone upon his fore-
 haad.
" Mr. Oak.
---
said Gabriel.
---
" I shall not be your mistress much longer, shall I
 Gabriel?"
---
Oak replied, with some awkwardness.

---
that I get a lady visitor
---
that I'm
 afraid I have n't proper accommodation
---
I am sorry that my chairs all have wood seats, and are
 rather hard, but
---
I was thinking of getting some new
 ones."
---
Oak placed two or three for her.

---
down sat he, the fire dancing
 in their faces, and upon the old furniture
 all a- sheenen

---
that formed Oak's array of household possessions, which
 sent back a dancing reflection in reply
---
now that
 Oak had become the entertainer their lives seemed to be
.

---
" But I thought--
---
Gabriel, I have been uneasy in the
 belief that I have offended you, and
---
I could n't help."

---
" Have n't I?"
---
he said, simply.
---
" I
 have arranged for Little Weatherbury Farm and.
---
I've

---
Gabriel looked her long in the face, but the firelight
 being faint there was not much to be seen.
---
" Bathsheba,"
 he said, tenderly and in surprise, and coming closer:
" if I only knew one thing-- whether you would allow me
 to love you and win you, and marry you after ali- if I
 only knew that!"

---
" Oh-- Oh!" said Gabriel, with a low laugh of joyous-
 ness.
---
I was the first sweetheart that you ever had, and

---
I shall not forget it!"

---
he said,
---
that I, as
 an unmarried man, carrying on a business for you as a
 very taking young woman, had a proper hard part to
 play-- more particular that people knew I had a sort
 of feeling for'ee
---
I fancied, from the way we were
.

---
" Oh, how glad I am!"
---
I came
---
" I have thought so
 much more of you since I fancied you did not want
 even to see me again.
---
But I must be going now, or
---
I
 shall be missed.
---
" And quite right too." said Oak.
---
" I've danced at
 your skittish heels, my beautiful Bathsheba, for many a
 long mile, and many a long day; and
---
He accompanied her up the hill,.

---
because men and
 women associate, not in their labours, but in their
 pleasures merely
---
he meditated a full hour by the clock upon
.

---
he said
 to himself at last."
---
On a dark night, a few days later, Oak came with
 mysterious steps from the surrogate's door, in Caster-
 bridge.
---
On the way home he heard a heavy tread in
 front of him, and,
---
him to be
 Coggan
---
when he heard his lone
 voice among certain hard words of the Psalms, whither
 no man ventured to follow him
---
said Oak,".
---
I'm going
 down this way
---
" Oh!" said Coggan, surprised;"
---
for Coggan had been true as
 steel all through the time of Gabriel's unhappiness about
 Bathsheba
---
Gabriel said,"?"

---
You can keep a secret,
 Coggan
---
" Yes, I have, and
---
I do know.
---
and I mean.
---
And yet I've thought of
 such a thing from time to time
---
; true, I have.
---
I wish' ee joy o' her."

---
But I assure' ee.
---
what I wished for at all
---
, in fact-- so I be doing
 this."

---
" Ay, I see:
---
quite right, too, I suppose.

---
I must say
---
I am afeard your labour in keeping it close
---
said Coggan,
---
said Oak,.
---
" Yet I must tell him to-
 night,."

---
I suppose,
---
for he's working so far off, and leaves
 early
---
" I'll tell' ee."
---
said Coggan.

---
" I'll knock and,
.
---
Then he'll come out,
 and
---
what I
 want en for
---
I'll make up a few words about the
 farm- work, as a blind."

---
Coggan
 advanced boldly, and.
---
" I wanted."

---
" He's not at home, and.
---
I shall do quite as well."

---
" I hardly think.
---
Coggan stepped round the corner of the porch.

---
Who's t'other man, then
---
" Only a friend." said Coggan.

---
he's wanted
---
" Say to meet mistress near church- hatch
 to- morrow morning at ten." said Oak, in a whisper.

---
" That he must come without fail, and."

---
said Coggan.

---
So Coggan delivered the message."
---
Mind, het or
 wet, blow or snow, he must come,' Tis
 very particular, indeed.
---
now I've told' ee,."

---
, in a way I should n't

---
if I had n't loved' ee so hopeless well
---
Coggan retired;
 and
---
Then Gabriel went home,
 and.

---
" Farmer Oak is coming
 here!"

---
Nevertheless,
 at twenty minutes to ten o'clock, Oak came out of his
 house, and

---
A man puts out,
 and.
---
that the forms under
 the umbrellas were those of Oak and Bathsheba, arm- in-
 arm for the first time in their lives, Oak in a greatcoat
 extending to his knees, and Bathsheba in a cloak that
 reached her clogs
---
that Farmer Oak should go there,
---
since
 he had as yet neither money, house, nor furniture worthy
 of the name,
---
though he was on a sure way towards them,

---
" There!" said Oak,,
---
Oak took up the light and,

---
" There!" said Oak, laughing," I knew, by the look on their face;"
. The
 rays fell upon a group of male figures gathered upon the
 gravel in front, who, when they saw the newly- married
 couple in the porch, set up a loud" Hurrah!" and
---
Those bright boys, Mark Clark and Jan, are at the
 bottom of all this.
---
"" said Oak.
---
Here's long life and happiness
 to neighbour Oak and his comely bride!"

---
said Gabriel.
---
I had
 a thought that we might very likely get a salute of some
 sort from our old friends, and
---
I was saying so to my
 wife but now."

---
" Faith." said Coggan, in a critical tone,
---
" the man hev learnt,
---
he is in wedlock as yet-- hey, neighbours all?"

---
said Jan,
.

---
Then Oak laughed, and
---
" Yes; I suppose.
---
" said Joseph
 Poorgrass with a cheerful sigh as they moved away;
" and
---
I wish him joy
---
though I were once or
 twice upon saying to- day with holy Hosea, in my
 scripture manner, which is my second nature
---
I feel my thanks
 accordingly."
