the nineteenth century had reached
 one- third of its span,
---
They were plainly but.


---
which had accumulated on their shoes and garments from
 an obviously long journey
---
the thick
 hoar of dust lent a disadvantageous shabbiness to their
 appearance just now
---
a straw hat overlaid
 with black glazed canvas.
---
there was, further
---
What was really peculiar, however, in this couple's progress, and.
---
they preserved
---
They walked
 side by side in such a way;
---
it
 could be discerned.
---
this apparent
 cause were the real cause, or
---
any word at all were uttered by the little group
---
The
 first phase was the work of Nature, the second probably of civilization.


---
No other than such
 relationship would have accounted for the atmosphere of stale
 familiarity which the trio carried along with them like a nimbus as they
 moved down the road.


---
that matter being one
---
that might have been
 matched at almost any spot in any county in England at this time of
 the year
---
fixed ahead bordered by hedges, trees, and other vegetation, which had entered the
 blackened- green stage of colour that the doomed leaves pass through on
 their way to dingy, and yellow, and red.
---
The grassy margin of the bank,
 and the nearest hedgerow boughs were powdered by the dust that had been
 stirred over them by hasty vehicles, the same dust as it lay on the road
 deadening their footfalls like a carpet; and
---
this allowed.


---
every extraneous sound to be
 heard
---
there was none, beyond the voice of a weak bird singing
 a trite old evening song that might doubtless have been heard on the
 hill at the same hour, and with the self- same trills, quavers, and
 breves, at any sunset of that season for centuries untold.
---
they
 approached the village sundry distant shouts and rattles
---
yet screened from
 view by foliage
---
When the outlying houses of Weydon- Priors could just be

---
The reader promptly
 glanced up.


---
Any trade doing here asked phlegmatically,.
---
the labourer did

---
The turnip- hoer had already begun.
---
Then is there any house to let-- a little small new cottage just a
 builded, or such like?".


---
The pessimist still maintained a negative."
---
Pulling down is more the
 nater of Weydon.
---
There were five houses
---
cleared away last year, and
 three this; and the volk nowhere to go-- no, not so much as a thatched
 hurdle that's the way o' Weydon- Priors."


---
which nodded with some
 superciliousness
---
There is
 something going on here
---
you hear now
---
what is little more than the
 clatter and
---
Though scurry of getting away the money o' children and fools, for
 the real business is done earlier than this.
---
I've been working within
 sound o't all day, but
---
I did n't go up--."


---
which showed standing- places and pens where many hundreds of
 horses and sheep had been exhibited and sold in the forenoon
---
their informant had
 observed, but
---
little real business remained on hand, and
---
the chief being the
 sale by auction of a few inferior animals, that could not otherwise
 be disposed of,
---
who came and
---
the crowd was denser now
 than during the morning hours,
---
the frivolous contingent of visitors,
 including journeymen out for a holiday, come on
 furlough, village shopkeepers, and the like,
---
having latterly flocked in
---
Yet a stray soldier or two persons found a congenial field among the peep- shows,
 toy- stands, waxworks, inspired monsters, disinterested medical men who
 travelled for the public good, thimble- riggers, nick- nack vendors, and
 readers of Fate.


---
Neither of our pedestrians had much heart for these things, and
---
they
 looked around for a refreshment tent among the many which dotted the
 down.
---
which stood nearest to them in the ochreous haze of expiring
 sunlight
---
Two,, seemed.
---
One was formed of new,
 milk- hued canvas, and
---
bore red flags on its summit it announced" Good
 Home- brewed Beer, Ale, and Cyder."
---
The other was less new
---
a little iron
 stove- pipe came out of it at the back and in front
---
Good Furmity Sold Hear."
---
I always like furmity; and
---
so
 does Elizabeth- Jane; and so will you.
---
It is nourishing after a long hard
 day."


---
I've never tasted it
---
they entered the furmity booth forthwith.


---
A rather numerous company appeared within,.
---
that ran down the tent on each side
---
stood a
 stove,.
---
it was made
 of bell- metal
---
Vessels
 holding the separate ingredients stood on a white- clothed table of
 boards and trestles close by.


---
This was very well so far,
 for furmity,;
---
the grains of wheat swollen as large as lemon- pips,
 which floated on its surface
---
there was more in that tent; and
---
The liquor poured in.

---
it had been in its natural state
---
hers laced also
---
the rum being
 signalled for in yet stronger proportion.
---
The child began, and
---
You know
---
we may have
 trouble in getting it if we do n't go soon."


---
The child's black eyes gazes
 at the candles when they were lighted,
---
, after slow, round, ruminating fell together then they opened,

---
At the end of the first basin at the
 second the
 qualities began
---
The conversation took a high turn,.

---
it often does on such occasions
---
I did for myself that way thoroughly
---
said the trusser with a
 contemplative bitterness that was well- night resentful.
---
I married at
 eighteen, like the fool that I was; and
---
this is the consequence o't."
---
who seemed accustomed to such remarks
---
I haven't more than fifteen shillings in the world, and
---
yet I am a good
 experienced hand in my line.
---
I'd challenge England; and
---
if again I'd be worth a thousand
 pound.
---
I'd done o't
---
a fellow never knows these little things
 till all chance of acting upon'em."


---
The auctioneer selling the old horses in the field outside could be

---
Now this is the last lot-- now who'll take the last
 lot for a song
---
Shall I say forty shillings?'."


---
I do n't see
---
who have got wives and
---
these gipsy fellows do their old horses
---
Why should n't they put'em up and?
---
who are in need of such articles
---
Why I'd
 sell mine this minute!"


---
There's them,"
---
that would do that
---
" some of the guests replied,.


---
who was by no means
---
True said a smoking gentleman
---
"," whose coat had the fine polish about
 the collar, elbows, seams, and shoulder- blades that long- continued
 friction with grimy surfaces will produce, and.
---
which is usually
---
I've had my breedings in as good circles
---
I know true cultivation, or
---
nobody do
---
I
 can declare--."
---
it may want a little bringing out
---
" Well, then, now is your chance I am open to an offer for this gem o'
 creation."


---
you have talked this
 nonsense in public places before
---
A joke is a joke, but
---
you may make it
 once too often, mind!"


---
I know
---
I've said it before
---
I meant it.
---
I want
---
All is a buyer."


---
which had by
 chance
---
a swallow, one among the last of the season, found its way through an opening into the upper part of the tent,
.
---
it made
---
its escape neglected, and
---
the
 subject dropped.


---
the instrument fetches up the
 original theme
---
Here I am waiting.

---
The company had by this time and
---
the renewed
 inquiry was received with a laugh of appreciation.
---
it is getting dark, and
.
---
this nonsense wo n't do
---
you do n't come along
---
If I shall go without you.

---
I
 asked this question, and
---
nobody answered to' t. any Jack Rag or Tom
 Straw among ye?"


---
Mike, Mike said
---
this is getting serious.
---
I wish
---
somebody would
---
So we are agreed about that.
---
you
 hear?
---
It's an agreement to part.
---
I'll take my tools, and.'
---
I be,"
---
Who'll make an offer
 for this lady?"


---
someone was a laugh
---
Who'll say a guinea?
---
Nobody answered; and.


---
the female dealer in staylaces interposed
---
a cruelty
 is the poor soul married to!
---
Bed and board is dear at some figures' pon
 my' vation' tis!"


---
Set it higher, auctioneer said the trusser.


---
Two guineas!" said the auctioneer;
---
no one replied.


---
If they'll have
---
" Four guineas!" cried the auctioneer.


---
I'll tell ye
---
the basins danced
---
you agree?"


---
Five guineas said the auctioneer," or.
---
Do anybody
 give it?
---
said a loud voice from the doorway.


---
All eyes were turned.
---
which formed
 the door of the tent
---
Standing in the triangular opening was a sailor, who, unobserved by the rest, had
 arrived there within the last two or three minutes.
---
You say?"
---
you do
---
I say so
---
replied the sailor.


---
Saying is one thing, and
---
paying is another.
---
Where's the money?"


---
The sailor hesitated a moment.
---
They were
---
Bank- of- England notes for five pounds.
---
The sight of real money in full amount then deemed slightly hypothetical.
---
Their eyes became, and
---
they lay,
---
then as weighted by the shillings,
 on the table.


---
it could not positively have been asserted.

---
The spectators had indeed taken the proceedings throughout as a piece of
 mirthful irony carried to extremes; and.
---
A lurid colour
 seemed, and.
---
The
 mirth- wrinkles left the listeners' faces, and
---
they waited with parting
 lips.


---
you go further
---
you touch that money
---
Mind it is a
 joke no longer."


---
Of course it is not a joke!"
---
I take the money
---
the sailor takes
 you.
---
That's plain enough.
---
It has been done elsewhere-- and why not here?"


---
Tis quite on the understanding that said
 the sailor blandly.
---
you swear
---
I do
---
", said
 the trusser.
---
Mike've lived with thee a couple of years, and!
---
Now I'm no more to' ee
---
I'll try my luck elsewhere.
'
---
Twill be better for me and Elizabeth- Jane, both.
---
the tent sobbing bitterly
---
some of the guests laughed.


---
said some rustics near the door.


---
Some others followed, and
---
they stood
.
---
The difference between the peacefulness of
 inferior nature and the wilful hostilities of mankind was very apparent
 at this place.
---
several horses crossing their necks and

---
they waited in patience
---
all was quiet.
---
The sun had recently set, and the west heaven was hung
 with rosy cloud, which seemed permanent
---
To watch
 it was like looking at some grand feat of stagery from a darkened
 auditorium.
---
it was remembered
---
all terrestrial conditions were
 intermittent, and
---
might some night be
---
mankind innocently sleeping

---
when these quiet objects were raging loud
---
Where do the sailor live
---
when they had vainly
 gazed around
---
God knows."
---
who had seen high life
---
Serves the husband well be- right said the staylace vendor.
---
I'd ha done it myself
---
I would n't
---
I'd go, and
---
I'd never come back-- no, not till the great
 trumpet
---
' a might call, and call, till
 would I!"


---
Well, said another of a more
 deliberative turn.
---
which is
---
not been used to lately, by all showings
---
said the trusser,.
---
it
 were
---
perhaps it was late
---
Perhaps because the customers thinned away
 from the tent shortly after this episode.
---
The furmity seller decided, and after
 seeing the rum- bottles, milk, corn, raisins, etc.
---
that remained on
 hand,
---
the tent was
---
who was obviously no tramp
---
the
 sleeper,, stay
---
The morning sun was streaming through the crevices of the canvas.
---
A warm glow pervaded the whole atmosphere of the marquee,
 and
---
a single big blue fly buzzed musically round and.
---
there was not a sound.
---
supported by trestles
---
A confused picture of the events of the previous evening seemed, and
---
A rustling
 revealed.


---
the sailor's bank- notes thrust carelessly in
---
now
 they were not dreams
---
I must get out of this as soon as I can
---
We walked here, and
---
I had the
 furmity, and rum in it-- and.
---
that's
---
what's happened and

---
here am I.
---
Now am I--"
 
---
am I sober enough to walk
---
I wonder?
---
The freshness of the
 September morning inspired and.
---
when they arrived the night before
---
they had observed
 but little of the place
---
It
 exhibited itself.
---
bounded on one extreme by
 a plantation, and
---
approached by a winding road
---
which lent its name to the upland and the annual fair
---
that was

---
the
 village held thereon.
---
The spot stretched downward into valleys, and
---
The whole scene lay under the rays of a newly risen
 sun, which had not as yet dried a single blade of the heavily dewed
 grass,
---
the shadows of the yellow and red vans were projected far
 away, those thrown by the felloe of each wheel being elongated in shape
 to the orbit of a comet.
---
who had remained
 on the ground
---
All the gipsies and showmen lay snug within their carts and tents or.
---
that revealed their presence
---
the Seven Sleepers had a dog; and
---
vagrants own
---
dogs of the mysterious breeds that
 are.
---
as much like cats as dogs and as much like foxes
 as cats also lay about here
---
A little one started up under one of the
 carts, and.

---
This seemed.
---
which flitted about the hedges with straws
 in their bills
---
the crowns of the mushrooms, and the tinkling of local
 sheep- bells had had the good fortune not to be included
 in the fair
---
Did I tell my name to anybody last night, or?"
 .
---
did n't I tell my name
---
there was some sort of binding force in the
 transaction
---
I am not in my senses
---
when I do
 that
---
I must walk about....
---
I was
---
meekness has done me more harm than the
 bitterest temper!"


---
The village was quite
 still,.
---
it being that motionless hour of rustic daily life which fills
 the interval between the departure of the field- labourers to their work,
 and the rising of their wives and daughters
---
the
 door being only latched
---
which lay on the
 Communion- table
---
I, Michael Henchard do
 take an oath before God here in this solemn place
---
I will avoid all
 strong liquors for the space of twenty- one years to come,
---
I have lived
---
I swear upon the book before
 me; and
---
I be
---
I break this my
 oath!
---
the hay- trusser arose,
 and.
---
the
 housewife agreed.
---
which was done
---
The perplexing nature of the undertaking became apparent soon enough.

---
it was equally in vain.
---
The truth was.


---
it was probably for this reason

---
Weeks counted up to months, and
---
The highroad into the village of Weydon- Priors was again carpeted with
 dust.
---
The trees had put on as of yore their aspect of dingy green, and

---
where the Henchard family of three had once walked along
---
two persons
 not unconnected with the family walked now.


---
The scene in its broad aspect had so much of its previous character,
 even to the voices and
---
Change was;
 but
---
here it was obvious.

---
a long procession of years had passed by
---
who walked the road
---
it was considerably thinner than heretofore.

---
which is
 itself
---
A glance was sufficient to inform the eye
---
, transferred so dexterously by Time to the second figure
---
They walked with joined hands, and
---
it could be perceived.
---
this was
 the act of simple affection
---
Reaching the outskirts of the village they pursued the same track as
 formerly, and.
---
Here too it was evident that the
 years had told.
---
Certain mechanical improvements might have been noticed
 in the roundabouts and high- fliers, machines for testing rustic strength
 and weight, and.
---
the
 real business of the fair had considerably dwindled.
---
The new periodical
 great markets of neighbouring towns were beginning.
---
The pens for
 sheep, the tie- ropes for horses, were about half as long as they had
 been.
---
The stalls of tailors, hosiers, coopers, linen- drapers, and other
 such trades had almost disappeared, and
---
the vehicles were far less
 numerous.
---
Why did we hinder our time by coming in here?
---
I thought?"
---
you wished
---
my dear Elizabeth- Jane explained the other.
---
I had a fancy
 for looking up here."


---
It was here"


---
you have told me so before.
---
It was edged with black, and
."


---
who was
---
it was here,"
---
I
 last saw the relation.
---
we are going Mr
---
I have never clearly had told
 me."


---
That's!"
---
you have said a score of times before
---
I suppose?"

"
---
I suppose?"
---
It is not much use inquiring here for anybody
---
I should think,"
---
the
 daughter observed,.
---
People at fairs change
 like the leaves of trees; and
---
I daresay."


---
you are the only one here to- day
 who was here all those years ago
---
I am not so sure of that
---
The daughter looked in the direction.
---
The object pointed
 out.
---
kept hot by a smouldering wood fire beneath
---
I will just say a word--."


---
you can stay here
---
When the soi- disant widow
 had taken the basin of thin poor slop that stood for the rich concoction
 of the former time
---
the hag opened a little basket behind the fire, and

---
you know
---
it slip down like cordial
---
You've seen better
 days
---
ye may say it!"
---
I've stood in this fair- ground, maid,
 wife, and widow, these nine- and- thirty years, and!
---
it was
---
you'd hardly believe.
---
I was once the owner of a great
 pavilion- tent that was the attraction of the fair
---
Nobody could come,

---
nobody could go, without having a dish of Mrs. Goodenough's furmity.

---
I knew the clergy's taste
---
the dandy gent's taste I knew the town's
 taste, the country's taste.
---
I even knowed the taste of the coarse
 shameless females.
---
straightforward dealings do n't bring profit--'tis the sly and the
 underhand that get on in these times!"


---
Can you call to mind
---
The hag reflected, and
---
it had been a big
 thing
---
If I should have minded it in a moment
---
I can mind every
 serious fight o' married parties, every murder, every manslaughter,
---
t has been my lot to
 witness.
---
Was it done quiet- like?"


---
I think so."


---
yet I do.

---
Lord bless ye,.
---
we do n't gi'e
 it head- room
---
we do n't, such as that
---
The only reason is
---
if I was
---
I should n't ha' thought of it again!"


---
it was by that
 unscrupulous person's liquor
---
's get on
---
you to buy
 refreshments there
---
I see none but the lowest do."


---
I have learned
---
I wanted, however
---
our relative visited this fair
---
It is a long, long way from here, and
---
it was many years
 ago, but
---
there I think."


---
we'll go
---
they descended out of the fair, and.





---
where they obtained a night's lodging
---
A hundred times the tragical crisis
 of which had been the transaction at Weydon Fair,.
---
It had seemed, indeed folly to think
 of making Elizabeth- Jane wise.


---
the exact bearings and legal limits of that right were
 vague
---
It may seem strange to sophisticated minds and.
---
a sane young
 matron could believe in the seriousness of such a transfer;
---
numerous other instances of the same belief might
 scarcely be credited
---
When Elizabeth- Jane was about twelve
 years old
---
the three returned to England, and.


---
it was during this period
.
---
the delusion so carefully sustained had vanished for ever
---
when the season came round
---
Henchard they heard nothing.
---
Elizabeth- Jane developed early into womanliness.
---
which was worn loose
---
the
 rays streamed into its depths as into a hazel copse
---
There was an under- handsomeness in it,.
---
that resulted from the straitened circumstances of
 their lives
---
They both were still in
---
yet now it still remained but little unfolded.
---
The
 desire-- was indeed.
---
The sailor, drowned or
---
they found
---
they proceeded on their journey,.
---
The
 strictest economy was indispensable.
---
Sometimes they might have been seen
 on foot, sometimes on farmers' waggons, sometimes in carriers' vans; and

---
thus they drew near to Casterbridge.
---
it once had been
---
there
 was ever and
---
which showed that
---
renunciatory tone,
 but would not be very sorry to quit a life
---
It was on a Friday evening, near the middle of September and
---
just they reached the summit of a hill within a mile of the place
 they sought.
---
There were high banked hedges to the coach- road here,
 and
---
they mounted upon the green turf within, and.
---
The spot
 commanded a full view of the town and its environs.


---
it seems!
---
" What an old- fashioned place to be said Elizabeth- Jane,.
---
It is huddled
 all together; and
---
it is shut in by a square wall of trees, like a plot
 of garden ground by a box- edging."


---
Its squareness was, indeed, the characteristic which most struck the eye
 in this antiquated borough, the borough of Casterbridge-- at that time,
 recent as it was, untouched by the faintest sprinkle of modernism.
---
It
 was compact as a box of dominoes.
---
It had no suburbs-- in the ordinary
 sense.
---
Country and town met at a mathematical line.


---
Casterbridge must have appeared on
 this fine evening as a mosaic- work of subdued reds, browns, greys, and
 crystals,.
---
held together by a rectangular frame of deep green
---
it stood as an indistinct mass behind a dense
 stockade of limes and chestnuts, set in the midst of miles of rotund
 down and concave field.
---
The mass became gradually dissected by the
 vision into towers, gables, chimneys, and casements, the highest
 glazings
---
they caught
 from the belt of sunlit cloud in the west
---
It was by one of these avenues that the
 pedestrians were about to enter.
---
they had risen,
---
they receded,
---
I thought so too
---
Shall I run after them, and
---
we know
---
Dear me-- why should you think that, mother?"


---
Twas just something to say that's all!
---
we must make private
 inquiries."


---
Having sufficiently rested they proceeded on their way at evenfall.
---
The
 dense trees of the avenue rendered the road dark as a tunnel,
---
the
 open land on each side was still under a faint daylight, in other words
---
though they passed down a midnight between two gloamings.
---
now the human side
 came to the fore
---
they had wandered about
---
As soon as they could see.
---
which framed in Casterbridge
---
the stockade of gnarled trees was itself
 an avenue, standing on a low green bank or escarpment, with a ditch
 yet visible without
---
bank was a wall more or
 less discontinuous, and
---
these external features were but

---
the ancient defences of the town planted as a promenade
---
The lamplights now glimmered through the engirdling trees,.
---
The difference between burgh
 and champaign was increased, too, by sounds which now reached them above
 others-- the notes of a brass band.
---
The travellers returned into the High
 Street, where there were timber houses with overhanging stories
---
whose small- paned lattices were screened by dimity curtains on a
 drawing- string, and.
---
There were houses of brick- nogging, which derived their chief
 support from those adjoining.
---
There were slate roofs patched with tiles,
 and tile roofs patched with slate, with occasionally a roof of thatch.


---
the town
 depended for its existence
---
The agricultural and pastoral character of the people upon whom was shown by the class of objects displayed
 in the shop windows.
---
Scythes, reap- hooks sheep- shears the iron- monger's milking stools and pails, hay- rakes,
 field- flagons, and seed- lips at the cooper's; cart- ropes and
 plough- harness at the saddler's; carts, wheel- barrows, and mill- gear at
 the wheelwright's and machinist's, horse- embrocations at the chemist's;
 at the glover's and leather- cutter's, hedging- gloves, thatchers'
 knee- caps, ploughmen's leggings, villagers' pattens and clogs.


---
They came to a grizzled church
---
whose massive square tower rose unbroken
 into the darkening sky,.
---
the lower parts being illuminated by the nearest
 lamps sufficiently
---
how completely the mortar from the joints
 of the stonework had been nibbled out by time and weather, which had
 planted in the crevices
---
the clock
 struck eight, and
---
thereupon a bell began.
---
The curfew was still rung in Casterbridge, and.
---
it was utilized by
 the inhabitants as a signal for shutting their shops
---
No sooner did the
 deep notes of the bell throb between the house- fronts than a clatter
 of shutters.
---
business at Casterbridge was ended for the day.


---
Other clocks struck eight from time to time-- one gloomily from the gaol,
 another from the gable of an almshouse, with a preparative creak of
 machinery, more audible than the note of the bell
---
a row of tall,
 varnished case- clocks from the interior of a clock- maker's shop joined
 in one after another
---
just the shutters were enclosing them, like a
 row of actors delivering their final speeches before the fall of the
 curtain
---
; as then chimes were heard;.


---
chronologists of the advanced school were appreciably on
 their way to the next hour before the whole business of the old one
---
they nibbled critically.

---
they had
 an appetite
---
Ye may as well look for manna- food as good bread in Casterbridge just
 now
---
They can blare their trumpets
 and.
---
where the brass band could be

---
we must be
 put- to for want of a wholesome crust
---
There's less good bread than good
 beer in Casterbridge now."


---
How does it happen
---
there's no good bread
---
they did n't know

---
they SAY,
---
the dough ran all over the ovens like
 quicksilver
---
" Oh,' tis the corn- factor-- which was growed so till the loaves be as flat as toads, and like suet
 pudden inside.
---
I never see
 such unprincipled bread in Casterbridge as this before.--But?"


---
you must be
 a real stranger here not to know what's made all the poor volks' insides
 plim like blowed bladders this week
---
I am
---
a couple of biscuits at the shop indicated as a temporary
 substitute for a meal
---
Getting they next bent their steps instinctively to where
 the music was playing.





---
A few score yards brought them to the spot where the town band was now
."


---
The building before whose doors had pitched their music- stands.
---
A spacious
 bow- window projected into the street over the main portico, and from the
 open sashes came the babble of voices, the jingle of glasses, and the
 drawing of corks.
---
The blinds moreover being left unclosed
---
,, the whole
 interior of this room could be surveyed from the top of a flight of
 stone steps to the road- waggon office opposite
---
a knot
 of idlers had gathered there.


---
We might
---
who had seemed strangely weak and agitated
---
I
 think,--.
---
you know,

---
I think
---
You had better be the one to do it.
---
I'm too worn out to do
 anything pull down your fall first."


---
What's going on to- night
---
ye must be a stranger sure
---
we plainer fellows bain't invited
---
As
 they leave the winder- shutters open
.
---
we may get jist a sense o't out here
---
you mount the steps you
 can see em.
---
when they begun life
---
lots of them
 were no more!"


---
I be now
---
That laugh was
---
hence it may have been
.
---
well it was rarely heard
---
Many theories might have been built upon
 it.
---
It fell in well with conjectures of a temperament which would have
 no pity for weakness, but.
---
Its producer's personal goodness if would be of a very fitful cast-- an occasional almost oppressive
 generosity rather than a mild and constant kindness.


---
the discovery of such unexpected
 social standing in the long- sought relative naturally begot
---
the
 two for wine were empty,.


---
the third, a tumbler was half full of
 water
---
Time, the magician, had wrought much here.
---
it is
 enough for me!
---
Now I only want."


---
I thought.
---
How strange you should have said!
---
Did ever anything go more by contraries!
---
I am not at all
---
I do n't know at all
---
I ca n't tell.
---
I feel so down."


---
now we have got here and all
---
where
 you be
---
I do n't think.
---
how I thought
---
I do n't wish."


---
The younger guests were talking and
---
eating with animation their
 elders were searching for titbits, and.
---
Three drinks seemed.


---
no palates ranged
---
each
 primed with a spoon
---
A row of ancient rummers with ground figures on their sides, and was now placed down the table, and
---
these were

---
Elizabeth- Jane noticed.


---
this filling went on with great
 promptness up and down the table
---
though nobody filled the Mayor's glass, who
 still drank large quantities of water from the tumbler behind the clump
 of crystal vessels intended for wine and spirits
---
do n't ye know?
---
I have heard, and.
---
has bode by it ever since
---
it would be unbecoming in the face of that: for
 yer gospel oath
---
knowing is a serious thing."


---
they say.
---
I do n't know the.
---
tis exactly
 two calendar years longer they say.
---
there's great strength in hope.
---
Knowing that in
 four- and- twenty months' time ye'll be out of your bondage, and able to
 make up for all you've suffered, by partaking without stint--."


---
a must need such
 reflections-- a lonely widow man
---
I know."


---
that's.
---
when' came here; and
---
I've seen, and
---
the sun rise over Durnover Moor these
 nine- and- sixty year
---
unfairly ever I've worked for'n
---
I be
---
though since seeing I must say.'
---
I have never before tasted such rough bread
---
that growed out
---
ye
 could a'most call it malt
---
there's a list at bottom o' the loaf as
 thick as the sole of one's shoe."


---
The band now struck up another melody, and
---
it was ended
---
the
 dinner was over, and
---
speeches began.
---
The evening being calm,
 and the windows still open could be distinctly heard.

---
hilarity was general but how about the bad bread?"


---
a new voice arose with,"
---
This is all very
 well;
---
It came from the lower end of the table,.


---
where there sat a group of
 minor tradesmen who, although part of the company, appeared to be a
 little below the social level of the others; and who seemed to nourish
 a certain independence of opinion and carry on discussions not quite
 in harmony with those at the head; just as the west end of a church
 is sometimes persistently found to sing out of time and tune with the
 leading spirits in the chancel
---
This interruption about the bad bread afforded infinite satisfaction to
 the loungers outside,
---
several of whom were in the mood which finds its
 pleasure in others' discomfiture; and
---
hence they echoed pretty freely,
" Hey!
---
who shared the feast
---
Moreover feeling none of the
 restraints of those they could afford,"!"


---
You
 rather ought
---
The interruption was sufficient to compel the Mayor to notice it.


---
I admit
---
the wheat turned out badly
---
I was

---
who bought it o' me
---
who had
---
You must make allowances for the accidents of a large business
---
You must bear in mind.
---
the weather just at the harvest of
 that corn was worse
---
we have known it for years
---
However I have

---
I have found my business
 too large
---
you will find
---
these mistakes will no longer occur--
---
matters will be
."


---
are you going
---
who seemed
---
Will
 you replace the grown flour we've still got by sound grain?"


---
I'll take it back with pleasure
---
it ca n't be done."


---
the group outside the window had within the last few minutes
---
Now been
 reinforced by new arrivals, some of them respectable shopkeepers and
 their assistants, who had come out for a whiff of air after putting up
 the shutters for the night; some of them of a lower class.
---
the subject seemed and
---
It was quaint and northerly.


---
The waiter took the note,?"


---
the young stranger continued--

 can tell me of a respectable hotel
---
that's a little more moderate
 than this
---
The waiter glanced indifferently up and down the street.


---
They say the Three Mariners, just below here,
---
I have never stayed there myself
---
While the waiter left the door, and
---
Elizabeth- Jane saw
 with some interest the note brought into the dining- room and handed to
 the Mayor.


---
Thereupon it was curious to note an unexpected effect.
---
nettled, clouded aspect had been broached,
---
The
 changed itself into one
 of arrested attention.
---
who has been captured
 by an idea
---
this time toasts and
---
speeches had given place to songs,
---
the wheat
 subject being quite forgotten.
---
which
 reached convulsive grimace
---
Some were beginning.
---
they did

---
how they had come there
---
they had come for
---
how they
 were going
---
their features grew disarranged and one- sided,, the corners of their mouth and eyes being bent upwards by the
 subsidence.
---
who had dined with extreme thoroughness
---
the heads of were somehow sinking into their
 shoulders
---
The clock struck nine.
---
do you propose?"


---
We must
 get a place to lie down in
---
I have seen-- Mr.
---
that's all I wanted to do."


---
That's enough for to- night, at any rate
---
" Elizabeth- Jane replied
 soothingly.
---
The
 question now is--?"


---
is it
---
shall we find a lodging
---
the Three Mariners was an inn of moderate charges
---
A
 recommendation good for one person was probably good for another.
---
's
 go
---
do you say?"


---
they went.


---
engendered by the note
---
the Mayor's thoughtfulness, as
 stated continued
---
who had brought the note which had been handed in a quarter
 of an hour before
---
I believe."


---
the songs, toasts, and conversation were

---
The Corporation,
 private residents, and major and minor tradesmen had
---
they had quite
 forgotten, not only the Mayor
---
they felt
---
which separated them like iron grills
---
It was the house to which the writer of the note had gone-- the
 Three Mariners--.
---
The bay window projecting into the
 street was so popular among the frequenters of the
 inn.
---
every passer knew,
---
A four- centred Tudor arch was over the entrance, and over the arch
 the signboard, now visible in the rays of an opposite lamp.
---
who had been represented by the artist as persons of two
 dimensions only-- in other words, flat as a shadow
---
Hereon
 the Mariners,-- were standing in a
 row in paralyzed attitudes.
---
Being on the sunny side of the street the
 three comrades had suffered largely from warping, splitting, fading, and
 shrinkage
---
so they were but a half- invisible film upon the reality
 of the grain, and knots, and nails, which composed the signboard.
---
A long, narrow, dimly- lit passage gave access to the inn, within which
 passage the horses going to their stalls at the back, and
---
latter
 running no slight risk of having their toes trodden upon by the animals
---
there being but
---
The good stabling and the good ale of the Mariners, though somewhat
 difficult to reach on account of this narrow way to
, were nevertheless perseveringly sought out by the sagacious old
 heads who knew what was what in Casterbridge.


---
Elizabeth- Jane and had arrived some twenty minutes earlier.

---
they had stood and
---
even this homely
 place recommended as moderate
---
Finally however they had found courage
 to enter, and
---
who drew
 and
---
It would have been altogether optional
 but for the orders of the landlady, a person who sat in the bar,
 corporeally motionless, but
---
where they sat
 down
---
The principle of the inn seemed, and
 windows, by quantities of clean linen spread about everywhere, and
---
this
 had a dazzling effect upon the travellers.


---
' Tis too good for us we ca n't meet it!"
---
they were left alone
---
I fear
---
it is, too
---
we must be respectable."


---
We must pay our way,"
---
even we must be respectable
---
us to make,
 I much fear
---
for we've only our own pockets to depend on."


---
I know
---
I'll do
---
" what said Elizabeth- Jane after an interval of waiting,
.
---
their needs seemed quite forgotten under the press of
 business below
---
you seem busy here to- night, and
---
who remained
---
The latter, as fixed in the arm- chair if melted into it when in a liquid state, and
---
Such arrangements as the one were
 not uncommon in country villages; but,
---
Casterbridge was

---
though old- fashioned the custom was well- nigh obsolete here.
---
A bell
 below tinkled a note that was feebler in sound than the twanging of
 wires and cranks that had produced it.


---
Now then can you go and?
---
it is
---
The front room over this."

 Elizabeth- Jane though hungry willingly postponed, and.
---
The accommodation of the Three Mariners was far
 from spacious, despite the fair area of ground it covered.
---
demanded by intrusive beams and rafters, partitions, passages,

---
The
 room staircases, disused ovens, settles, and four- posters, left comparatively
 small quarters for human beings.
---
Moreover this being at a time
---
home- brewing was abandoned by the smaller victuallers, and
---
a house in
 which was still
---
the quality of the liquor was the chief attraction
 of the premises,.
---
everything had
---
where the light caught it, and
---
the sort of velvet- pile or down, how was so truly curved as to be
 part of a globe, and
---
Mrs.
 Stannidge thereupon said with a considerate peremptoriness.


---
they meant
---
The meaning of this was soon apparent.
---
was evidenced by signs of a door of communication between
 them-- now screwed up and pasted over with the wall paper
---
is
 frequently the case with hotels of far higher pretensions than the Three
 Mariners, every word spoken in either of these rooms
---
Such sounds came through now.


---
Elizabeth- Jane
 was in the kitchen
---
who having entered the inn while waiting for the supper had been
---
the young
 Scotchman and Henchard,,, deferentially
 conducted upstairs by host Stannidge himself.
---
I merely strolled in on my way home
---
that has excited my curiosity
---
to ask you a question about
 something said the Mayor, with careless
 geniality.
---
I see."


---
you have not finished supper
---
I will be done in a little!
---
Ye need n't go, sir.
---
I've almost done, and
---
it makes no difference at all."


---
first I should ask
---
did you write this
---
A rustling of paper
 followed.


---
I did
---
" Yes, said the Scotchman.


---
I am under the impression that we have met by
 accident while waiting for the morning to keep an appointment with each
 other
---
you replied to an advertisement for a
 corn- factor's manager that I put into the paper-- ha'n't?"


---
you come here
---
to
 see me about it said the Scotchman, with some surprise.


---
who arranged
---
You're wrong!"
---
It is
 true.
---
I am in the corren trade-- but
---
I have replied to no advertisement,
 and
---
I am on my way to Bristol-- from there to the
 other side of the warrld,!
---
I have some inventions useful to the trade, and

---
there is no scope for developing them heere."


---
itself felt like a damp atmosphere
---
yet I could
 have sworn
---
The Scotchman murmured another negative, and."


---
there was a silence,
---
Then I am truly and
---
you wrote on that paper
---
It was nothing, sir."


---
it has a great importance for me just now.
---
I declare to Heaven
---
This row about my
 grown wheat, which did n't know
---
the
 people came
---
I've some hundreds
 of quarters of it on hand; and
---
your renovating process will make it
 wholesome,
---
if why you can see.
---
a quag' twould get me out of
---
I saw
 in a moment.
---
there might be truth in it
---
I should like and."


---
it
 proved;
---
you do n't care
---
me to do that, without my paying ye well for't first
---
I do n't know
---
I have any
 objection
---
I'm going to another country, and
---
I'll take up there
---
I'll tell ye the whole of
 it--.

---
you'll make more out of it heere than I will in a foreign country
---
I can show ye by a sample in my
 carpet- bag."


---
The click of a lock followed, and
---
there was a sifting and rustling
---
These few grains will be sufficient to show ye with
---
some operation seemed

---
It's complete!--quite restored, or-- well-- nearly."


---
Quite enough restored to make good seconds out of it said the
 Scotchman.
---
To fetch it back entirely is impossible
---
Nature wo n't stand
 so much as that, but.
---
heere you go a great way towards it
---
that's the process
---
Well, sir,
 I do n't value it, but of little use
 in countries where the weather is more settled than in ours; and
---
it can be
---
I'll be
 only too glad if it's of service to you."


---
you know
---
My business is in corn
 and in hay, but
---
I was brought up as a hay- trusser simply, and
---
hay is
.

---
I understand best
---
I now do more in corn than in the other
---
you'll accept the place
---
If you shall manage the corn branch entirely,
 and."


---
You're liberal-- very liberal, but
---
I cannet!"
---
So be it!"
---
one
 good turn deserves
---
Come to my house I can find something better for' ee than cold ham and
 ale."


---
I tell you,
.
---
this holds good for the bulk,
---
you have saved my credit, stranger though you be
---
shall I
 pay you for this knowledge?
---
It may not prove necessary, and
---
I do n't value it at all.
---
I thought, and
---
I might just as well
 let,
---
ye know
---
you were in a difficulty
---
they were harrd upon ye."


---
I sha n't soon forget this
---
I could n't believe!
---
I had
---
I am
---
yet it turns out, after all, a stranger!"


---
that's so
---
Your forehead, Farfrae is something like my poor
 brother's-- now dead and gone; and
---
You
 must be,
---
I reckon?
---
I am six foot one and a half
 out of my shoes.
---
judgment and knowledge are.
---
You are just the reverse
---
I can
 see that.
---
I have been looking for such as you these two year, and
---
yet
 you are not for me.
---
I go
---
me ask this:
---
Have you really made up your mind about this
 American notion?
---
I wo n't mince matters.
---
I feel--."


---
you would be invaluable
 to me
---
you will bide and
---
if be my manager I
 will make it worth your while
---
My plans are fixed
---
I have

---
so we need.
---
will you
 not drink with me, sir?
---
I find."


---
this Casterbridge ale warreming to the
 stomach
---
I fain, but
---
I ca n't
---
was well- nigh ruined by it!
---
I did a deed on account of it
.
---
I shall be ashamed of to my dying day
---
It made such an impression
 on me that I swore, there and then, that I'd drink nothing stronger than
 tea for as many years as I was old that day.
---
I have kept my oath; and

---
I am sometimes."


---
dry in the dog days I could
 drink a quarter- barrel to the pitching
---
that I think o' my oath, and
---
I'll no' press ye, sir--
---
I respect your vow."


---
I shall get a manager somewhere, no doubt
---
it will be long!"


---
I see one that
 would suit me so well
---
they reached the door
---
I wish
---
I could
 stay--
---
sincerely I would like"
---
it cannet be!
---
I want."





---
Thus they parted; and
---
The quivering of the
 partition to its core presently denoted
---
to be attracted by the lively bursts
 of conversation and melody from the general company below
---
which was large
---
each fitted with its genial occupant
---
The young Scotchman had just joined the guests.
---
These included an inferior set at the
 unlighted end.
---
whose seats were mere benches against the wall, and
---
who
 drank from cups instead of from glasses
---
was a small window, with a wheel ventilator in one
 of the panes, which would suddenly start off spinning with a jingling
 sound, as suddenly stop, and as suddenly start again.


---
There had been some singing; and

---
Elizabeth- Jane was fond of music
---
it was evident
---
the majority of the
 audience had not heard
---
such frequently they were attentive to a
 much greater degree than usual.
---
They whispered, nor.
---
The singer himself grew emotional,
---
the words went on:--

     
---
It's hame, and
---
it's hame,
---
would I be,
      O hame, hame, hame to my ain countree!
     
---
There's an eye that ever weeps, and
---
a fair face will be fain,
     
---
I pass through Annan Water with my bonnie bands again
---
As When the flower is in the bud, and
---
The lark shall sing me hame to my ain countree!"


---
There was a burst of applause, and a deep silence which was even more
 eloquent than the applause.
---
Then the ventilator in the window- pane spasmodically started off
 for a new spin, and
---
's have it again, stranger
---
Let said the glazier, a stout,
 bucket- headed man, with a white apron.
---
Folks
 do n't lift up their hearts like that in this part of the world."
---
Who is the young man?--Scotch
---
d'ye say
---
I believe
---
It was plain.

---
nothing so
 pathetic had been heard at the Three Mariners for a considerable time
---
who were only too prone to shut
 up their emotions with caustic words
---
our country down here is worth singing about like that
---
the Scotchman again melodized with a dying
 fall
---
When you take away from among us the fools
 and the rogues, and the lammigers, and the wanton hussies, and the
 slatterns, and such like
---
there's cust few left to ornament a song with
 in Casterbridge, or the country round."


---
True said Buzzford, the dealer,.

---
Casterbridge is a old, hoary place o' wickedness, by all account.'
---
Tis
 recorded in history, and."


---
we rebelled against the King one or two hundred
 years ago, in the time of the Romans
---
lots of us was hanged
 on Gallows Hill, and
---
our different jints sent about the
 country like butcher's meat; and
---
I can believe it
---
did ye come away from yer own country for, young maister,
---
ye be
 so wownded about it
---
it
 was n't worth your while on our account, for.
---
Maister Billy Wills says,

---
we be bruckle folk here-- the best o' us hardly honest sometimes, what
 with hard winters, and so many mouths to fill, and
---
We do n't
 think about flowers and fair faces, not we-- except in the shape o'
 cauliflowers and pigs' chaps."


---
None of
 ye has been stealing?"


---
ye know nothing of
---
that's travelled a'most from the
 North Pole
---
I loved my country

---
half as well as the young feller do
---
Be dazed if I'd live by claning my neighbour's
 pigsties afore
---
,, I'd go away
---
I've no more love for my country
 than I have for Botany Bay!"


---
we shall be here all night
---
That's all of it
---
" said the singer apologetically.


---
" Soul of my body then we'll have another!
---
, said the general dealer.


---
Can you turn a strain to the ladies, sir?"
---
hain't said the master glazier.


---
I have!
---
which awoke their sense of the ludicrous for the
 moment
---
Notwithstanding an
 occasional odd gravity they began.
---
Casterbridge had
 sentiment
---
Casterbridge had romance; but
---
this stranger's sentiment was
 of differing quality.
---
rather perhaps the difference was mainly
 superficial
---
; who is not really new, but.


---
The silent landlord came and without losing much of its
 perpendicular.

"
---
even Mrs. Stannidge managed
---
is trundled on the chine by a drayman
---
are you going?
---
I'm only passing thirrough
---
I am on my way to Bristol, and on frae
 there to foreign parts."


---
We be truly sorry to hear it
---
We can ill
 afford.

---
when they fall among us
---
we may say
---
ye mistake my country
---
There are not perpetual
 snow and wolves at all in it!--except snow in winter, and-- well-- a
 little in summer just sometimes, and a' gaberlunzie' or two stalking
 about here and there, if ye may call them dangerous.
---
you should
 take a summer jarreny to Edinboro', and Arthur's Seat, and all round
 there, and
---
you would never say'!"


---
Of course not it stands to reason
---
"-- said Buzzford.
---
that leads to such words
---
do ye carry your flock bed, and your quilt, and your crock, and
 your bit of chiney? or
---
do ye go in bare bones,?
---
I may say
---
I've sent on my luggage--
---
it is n't much
---
I said to
 myself,'!' and."


---
will I come by
---
I
 undertake it
---
I decided
---
Elizabeth- Jane shared not least
---
A general sense of regret, in which,
 made itself apparent in the company.
---
the
 Casterbridge toss- pots had done
---
rightly not there was none
---
they were a tragical rather than a
 comical thing
---
to feel as-- that that could be gay on occasion,
---
moments
 of gaiety were interludes, and no part of the actual drama.
---
It was
 extraordinary.


---
how similar their views were
---
it was still
---
which was the act of a few moments only
---
they met and
.


---
simple drapery accorded well
---
Thus it happened

---
I came in by my bower door
---
As day was waxin' wearie,
         
---
wha came
---
Elizabeth- Jane, rather disconcerted,; and
---
the Scotchman's
 voice died away,.


---
Here the scene and sentiment ended for the present.
---
We've made a mistake
---
ye to have helped.

---
you did
---
who would perhaps have been more alarmed at this
---
things stood
---
even they
 thought
---
When the Scotchman sang.


---
To be sure, to be sure how that fellow does draw me!"
---
I suppose' tis because I'm so lonely.
---
I'd have given him a
 third share in the business to have stayed!
---
Casterbridge was the complement of
 the rural life around, not its urban opposite.
---
who desired
---
Bees and butterflies in
 the cornfields at the top of the town, to get to the meads
 at the bottom took no circuitous course, but.
---
they were traversing
 strange latitudes
---
autumn airy spheres of thistledown floated
 into the same street,, innumerable tawny and yellow leaves skimmed along the pavement, and
.


---
Hearing voices, was close at hand
---
the Scotchman was
.
---
it appeared
---
you are off soon
---
" And I suppose?
---
said Henchard upwards.


---
Maybe I'll walk on."


---
the coach makes up on me
---
ye are going
---
Then shall we walk together to the top o' town?"


---
ye'll wait a minute
---
If said the Scotchman.


---
the latter emerged, bag in hand.
---
It showed.
---
my lad said,."


---
it might have been wiser
---
that were furthest off
---
It is
---
when I say
---
my plans are vague
---
They had by this time
---
Elizabeth- Jane heard no more.
---
they continued
 in conversation,, and

---
Thus they passed the King's Arms
 Hotel, the Market House, St. Peter's churchyard wall, ascending to the
 upper end of the long street;
 when they bent suddenly to the right into the Bristol Road, and were out
 of view.


---
they were small as two grains of corn
---
The simple thought, with its latent sense of slight, had moulded itself
 out of the following little fact:; and
---
You are still thinking, mother
---
they debated this question a procession of five large waggons.
---
They came in from the
 country, and.
---
the steaming horses had probably been travelling a great
 part of the night
---
The discussion was continued during breakfast, and.
---
the end of it was

---
There was
 promise in both.


---
Elizabeth- Jane stood, bonnet on, ready
 to depart
---
it does not become the good position
---
Then we would rather not intrude
---
If no," as if reached to in the town, to own-- to let, say,', sir, we will leave
 Casterbridge as quietly as we have come, and...
---
I almost feel, and
---
I would rather
---
Elizabeth- Jane went a few steps towards the landing."
---
I fully know
---
It was about ten o'clock, and
---
The front doors
 of the private houses were mostly left open at this warm autumn time,
 no thought of umbrella stealers disturbing the minds of the placid
 burgesses.
---
Hence thus
 unclosed could be seen, as through tunnels, the mossy gardens at the
 back, glowing with nasturtiums, fuchsias, scarlet geraniums," bloody
 warriors," snapdragons, and dahlias, this floral blaze being backed by
 crusted grey stone- work remaining from a yet remoter Casterbridge than
 the venerable one visible in the street.
---
which had older than old- fashioned backs
---
The old- fashioned fronts of
 these houses, rose sheer
 from the pavement,
---
the bow windows protruded like bastions,
.
---
which spoke so cheerfully of
 individual unrestraint as to boundaries
---
movables occupied the path and
 roadway to a perplexing extent.
---
who hailed from Mellstock, Weatherbury, The
 Hintocks, Sherton- Abbas, Kingsbere, Overcombe, and many other towns and
 villages round
---
Their owners were numerous enough to be regarded as a
 tribe, and.

---
Their vans had just arrived, and.
---
Moreover every shop pitched out half its
 contents upon trestles and boxes on the kerb, despite the
 expostulations of the two feeble old constables,.
---
which
 afforded fine opportunities for skill with the reins
---
hung shopblinds so constructed
---
Horses for sale were tied in rows
---
that had been modestly kept back from the
 general line
---
any inviting
 recess in front of a house was utilized by pig- dealers as a pen for their stock.


---
who came
---
The yeomen, farmers, dairymen, and townsfolk, to transact
 business in these ancient streets spoke in other ways than by
 articulation.
---
Not to hear the words of your interlocutor in metropolitan
 centres is.
---
Here the face, the arms, the
 hat, the stick throughout spoke equally with the tongue.
---
which was intelligible from the other end of the street
---
a sense of
 tediousness announced itself in a lowering of the person by spreading
 the knees to a lozenge- shaped aperture and contorting the arms.

---
Chicanery, subterfuge had hardly a place in the streets of this honest
 borough to all appearance; and
---
it was said.


---
the lawyers in the Court
 House hard by occasionally threw in strong arguments for the other side
 out of pure generosity( though apparently by mischance)
---
Thus Casterbridge was in most respects but
---
the pole, focus, or
 nerve- knot of the surrounding country life;.

---
which are as foreign bodies set down, like boulders
 on a plain, in a green world with which they have nothing in common
---
Casterbridge lived by agriculture at one.
---
The townsfolk
 understood every fluctuation in the rustic's condition,
---
it affected
 their receipts as much as
---
for they entered into the troubles
 and joys which moved the aristocratic families ten miles round-- for the
 same reason.
---
politics were viewed by them less
 from their own standpoint of burgesses with rights and privileges than
 from the standpoint of their country neighbours.


---
which delighted the eye
 by their quaintness, and
---
All the venerable contrivances and confusions in a measure reasonableness, in this rare old
 market- town were metropolitan novelties to the unpractised eyes of
 Elizabeth- Jane, fresh from netting fish- seines in a seaside cottage.

---
Very little inquiry was necessary.
---
The
 front door was open, and, as in other houses
---
which
 was studded with rusty nails speaking of generations of fruit- trees that
 had been trained there
---
The door opened upon the yard, and
---
It was.
---
flanked by hay- barns
---
were
 wooden granaries on stone staddles, to which access was given by Flemish
 ladders, and a store- house several floors high.
---
Wherever the doors of
 these places were open
---
a closely packed throng of bursting wheat- sacks
 could be seen.


---
that
 would not come
---
it is?"
---
will you wait a minute?
---
Elizabeth- Jane sits
---
When the two new acquaintances had passed out of sight that morning
 towards the Bath and Bristol road they went on silently, except for a
 few commonplaces,
---
they had gone down an avenue on the town walls
 called the Chalk Walk,.
---
where the North and West
 escarpments met
---
square earthworks
---
From this high corner of the could be seen.
---
A footpath ran steeply down the green
 slope,.
---
It was by this path.


---
the Scotchman had
---
which protected the descent
---
there was the inelegance of one
---
whose feelings are nipped and
.
---
wishes defeated
---
I shall often think of this time, and of how you came
 at the very moment to throw a light upon my difficulty."


---
ye are gone.
---
ever I'll speak
---
Once more will
 ye stay?
---
There it is, flat and plain.
---
You can see
---
it is n't all
 selfishness that makes me press' ee
---
Others
 would do for the place without doubt.
---
Some selfishness perhaps is, but
---
there is more
---
there
 it is n't.
---
me to repeat what
---
I'll agree to'em willingly and
---
ithout a
 word of gainsaying, hang it, I like thee well!"


---
I never expected this
---
I did not!
---
It's Providence!
---
I'll not go to America
---
; I'll stay and!"


---
Now you are my friend
---
's clinch it at once by clear terms,
---
Now I am
 sure you can eat another breakfast?
---
You could n't have eaten much so
 early,; though my word's my
 bond.
---
even they had anything at that place
---
they
 had n't so come to my house and
---
we will have a solid, staunch tuck- in,
 and
---
you like
---
I can always make a good meal in the morning.
---
I've got a splendid
 cold pigeon- pie going just now.
---
You can have."


---
some brewed
---
you
 want to
---
you know
---
It is too airly in the morning for that
---
I did n't know.
---
I do n't drink it because of my oath,
 but
---
I am obliged."


---
they returned, and
---
Here the matter was settled over the breakfast.
---
When
 it was done
---
some suitable
 lodgings could be found
---
The newcomer stepped forward like the quicker cripple
 at Bethesda, and.
---
I mentioned Thursday
---
you did not keep your
 appointment
---
as I have engaged another manager
---
I thought.
---
Do you think?"


---
I can wait
---
when business is in question
---
You said Thursday or Saturday, sir,
---
said the newcomer,.


---
you are too late
---
Well, said the corn- factor.
---
I can say no more."


---
You as good engaged me
---
I am sorry for you-- very
 sorry indeed.
---
it ca n't be helped."


---
There was no more to be said, and
---
Elizabeth- Jane now entered, and.

---
which always seemed,
---
Can I speak to you-- not on business, sir?"
---
I suppose."
---
I am sent
---
" to tell you, sir a distant
 relative of yours by marriage, Susan Newson, a sailor's widow is in the
 town, and."


---
you would wish
---
do you call yourself-- your Christian name?"


---
I am-- a good deal interested in your news
---
this is
 not a matter of business, but
---
we go indoors
---
It was with a gentle delicacy of manner,,.
---
It
 was furnished to profusion with heavy mahogany furniture of the deepest
 red- Spanish hues.
---
leaves hanging so low
---
they
 well- nigh touched the floor, and
---
the chairs were of
 the kind which, since that day, has cast lustre upon the names of
 Chippendale and Sheraton
---
In the
 chimney corner was a fire- grate with a fluted semicircular back, having
 urns and festoons cast in relief thereon, and though their patterns may
 have been such as
---
those illustrious carpenters never saw or.


---
A sailor's widow-- when did die?"


---
Do you and she come
 from abroad-- America or Australia
---
We have been in England some years.
---
I was twelve."


---
when we came here
 from Canada
---
These things being
 clear
---
I think.
---
I should like....
---
I am glad
 to see you here, Elizabeth- Jane-- very glad.
---
We must have a long talk
 together-- but not just now."


---
who had
 known so little friendship
---
The instant that showed
 itself more distinctly
---
I did n't think of that.

---
Perhaps these are impostors-- and Susan and the child dead after all!"


---
It never rains but
---
it pours!
---
It
 ran thus:--


.
---
you can
---
The place is easy to find.
---
I can say no more now.
---
The
 news upsets me almost.
---
so
 I have seen you
---
The amount was
 significant
---
The Ring at Casterbridge was merely the local name of one of the finest
 Roman Amphitheatres,.


---
Casterbridge announced old Rome in every street, alley, and precinct.

---
It looked Roman,.
---
It
 was impossible to dig more than a foot or two deep about the town
 fields and gardens without coming upon some tall soldier or other of the
 Empire,.
---
who would have felt an unpleasantness at the
 discovery of a comparatively modern skeleton in their gardens
---
Imaginative inhabitants,, were
 quite unmoved by these hoary shapes.
---
They had lived so long ago,
---
their
 time was so unlike the present,.


---
their hopes and motives were
---
that the living there seemed
---
even a spirit to pass
---
The Amphitheatre was a huge circular enclosure, with a notch at opposite
 extremities of its diameter north and south.
---
it might have been called the spittoon of the Jotuns.
---
It was.
---
the ruined Coliseum is to modern Rome, and
---
The dusk of evening was the proper hour at which
 a true impression of this suggestive place could be received.
---
Standing
 in the middle of the arena at that time there by degrees became apparent
 its real vastness,.
---
a cursory view from the summit at noon- day
 was apt to obscure
---
Melancholy, impressive, lonely, yet accessible from
 every part of the town was the frequent spot for
 appointments of a furtive kind.
---
Intrigues were arranged there
---
tentative
 meetings were there
---
one kind
 of appointment-- in itself seldom had place in
 the Amphitheatre: that of happy lovers.


---
it was pre- eminently an airy, accessible
---
Why seeing that, and
 sequestered spot for interviews, never took kindly to the soil of the ruin.
---
Perhaps it was.
---
its associations had about them
 something sinister
---
Its history proved that.
---
Apart from the sanguinary
 nature of the games originally played therein
---
such incidents attached
 to its past
---
the town- gallows had
 stood at one corner
---
Tradition reports.
---
not one of those ten thousand people ever cared particularly for
 hot roast after that
---
In addition to these old tragedies, pugilistic
 encounters almost to the death had come off down to recent dates in that
 secluded arena, entirely invisible to the outside world.
---
which ever took the trouble to do
---
So though close to the
 turnpike- road crimes might be perpetrated there unseen at mid- day.


---
the game usually languished
 for the aforesaid reason-- the dismal privacy which the earthen circle
 enforced,.

---
shutting out every appreciative passer's vision, every
 commendatory remark from outsiders-- everything, except the sky; and to
 play at games in such circumstances was like acting to an empty house
---
persons sitting
 with a book or dozing in the arena had, on lifting their eyes, beheld
 the slopes lined with a gazing legion of Hadrian's soldiery as if
 watching the gladiatorial combat
---
the scene would remain but a moment, like a
 lightning flash, and
---
It was related.
---
there still remained under the south entrance

---
who
 took part in the games
---
The arena was still smooth and circular,.
---
The sloping pathways
 had ascended to their seats.
---
the whole was grown over with grass, which now, at the end of summer,
 was bearded with withered bents that formed waves under the brush of the
 wind, returning to the attentive ear aeolian modulations, and detaining
 for moments the flying globes of thistledown.


---
entered by
 the south path which descended over the debris of the former dens
---
They met in the middle of the arena.

---
Neither spoke just at first
---
I do n't drink
---
You hear
---
Susan?--I do n't drink now--.
---
I haven't since that night
---
I had known
---
you were living, Susan
---
there was every reason to
 suppose you and the child.
---
I took every possible step
 to find you-- travelled--.
---
My opinion at last was.
---
Why did you keep silent like this?"


---
could there be?
---
I thought

---
I owed him faithfulness to the end of one of our lives--
---
foolishly
 I believed
---
there was something solemn and binding in the bargain
---
I
 thought.
---
I dared
---
I consider
 myself.
---
I have no claim upon you
---
I should
 never have come-- never
---
you may be sure."


---
How could you be so simple?"


---
I do n't know.
---
it would have been very wicked--!
---
I had not thought
 like that
---
so it would.
---
It is only that.
---
which makes
---
our living together again
---
I could not bear it
---
That was.
---
I could not bear
 it either."


---
You have heard"


---
I am in a large
 way of business here--
---
I am Mayor of the town, and churchwarden, and

---
I do n't know what all?
---
These things, as well as the dread of makes it necessary to act with extreme caution.
---
I
 do n't see
---
So that two I once treated badly, and and."


---
there's the rub
 o't
---
We'll go away at once.
---
I only came to see--"

"
---
you are
---
you mistake me!
---
I have thought of this plan:
---
I
 meet you, court you, and marry you.
---
Elizabeth- Jane coming to my house as
 my step- daughter.
---
The thing is so natural and easy.
---
it is half done
 in thinking o't
---
the secret would be yours and mine
 only; and."


---
I should have the pleasure of seeing my own only child under
 my roof, as well as my wife
---
I am quite in your hands
---
you tell me,
---
I am content to go."


---
Now now we do n't want
---
Of course
 you wo n't leave again.
---
I have proposed for a few
 hours
---
you ca n't hit upon a better one
---
if we'll adopt it.
---
I have
; but
---
you can get lodgings--
---
the only ones in the town fit for you are
 those over the china- shop in High Street-- and
---
you can also look for a
 cottage."


---
the lodgings are in High Street
---
If they are dear
---
I suppose?"


---
", Never mind you MUST start genteel.

---
our plan is
---
I come back
---
are you comfortable at the inn?"


---
ours?--that's
---
what makes me most anxious of all
---
I like the idea of repeating our marriage
---
It seems the only right course, after all this.
---
Now I think
."


---
I must go back to Elizabeth- Jane, and
---
our kinsman kindly wishes us
---
I'll go some way with you."


---
I can find my
 way back
---
" it is not late.
---
me go alone
---
Do you forgive me, Susan?"


---
the Mayor
 walked on through the tunnel- shaped passage into the garden, and thence
 by the back door towards the stores and granaries.
---
there being no blind to screen the interior

---
A light shone from
 the office- window, and could see.
---
me interrupt
 you,
---
ye will stay so late
---
which had been allowed
---
The
 corn- factor's mien was half admiring, and
---
You shall do no more to- night
---
There's time enough to- morrow.
---
Now you shall!
---
I am determined on't."
---
They locked up the office, and
---
The garden was silent, dewy, and full of
 perfume.
---
It extended a long way back from the house, first.
---
where the long- tied espaliers, old
 had grown so stout, and cramped, and gnarled

---
then they had pulled their stakes out of the ground and
---
they passed through them into
 the house.


---
The hospitalities of the morning were repeated, and.
---
's make a blaze--
---
there's nothing I hate like a black grate, even
 in September
---
a cheerful
 radiance spread around.


---
It is odd
---
we have done on
 a purely business ground, and
---
I should
 wish
---
But,, I have nobody else to speak to; and
---
why should n't I tell
 it to' ee?"


---
I'll be glad to hear it,
---
I can be of any service
---
flanked by heads of Apollo and
 Diana in low relief
---
I've not been always
---
I am now
---
deep
 voice being
---
I began life as a working
 hay- trusser, and
---
when I was eighteen
---
I married on the strength o' my
 calling.
---
I heard in the town."


---
you were a widower
---
you would naturally have heard that.
---
This is.

---
how it came about
---
I was travelling for employment, and.
---
We came to a booth in a
 country fair.
---
which had
---
The tinge of indifference been visible in the
 Scotchman now.


---
I have

---
kept my oath for nineteen years I have risen to what you
 see me now."


---
could I hear of in all that time; and
---
being by nature
 something of a woman- hater I have found it no hardship to keep mostly
 at a distance from the sex.
---
could I hear of till this
 very day.
---
I say,
---
what's?"


---
That's.
---
I've planned and
---
Ye do n't say that?"


---
Farfrae it is almost impossible.
---
It has been my custom
 for many years,
 particularly in the potato and root season.
---
I do a large trade wi' them
 in that line.
---
when stopping there I fell quite ill, and

---
I sank into one of those gloomy fits."


---
I sometimes suffer
 from, on account o' the loneliness of my domestic life,, and, like Job
---
when the world
 seems
---
I could curse the
 day that gave me birth
---
now I never feel like it
---
you never may
---
This young creature was staying at the boarding- house where
 I happened to have my lodging; and
---
when I was pulled down
---
Heaven knows
---
why I was n't worth it.
---
I wo n't go into
 particulars of what our relations were.
---
It is enough.
---
we
 honestly meant
---
which did me no harm
---
Though I solemnly declare
---
philandering with womankind
 has
---
I was perhaps more, because o' my dreary state; and
---
it
 was through this.
---
the scandal arose
---
I was well, and.
---
When I was gone
---
did n't forget
 to tell me so in letters one after another I felt.
---
I
 owed her something, and
---
as I would make this other one the only return I could make, and
---
we should
 soon have been married-- but, behold
---
when I was young
---
if all might now be well.
---
it stands
---
it is the second.
---
there's no doubt about that."


---
They are both in a very melancholy position, and
---
that's true!"
---
They are!
---
I do n't care--'twill all end one way.
---
these
 two. paused in reverie.
---
I should like,
---
it be helped!
---
said the other, with philosophic
 woefulness.
---
You write to the young lady, and
---
you
 must put it plain and honest
---
it turns out
---
That wo n't do.'
---
Od seize it
---
I must do a little more than that!
---
I
 must--
---
I
 suppose--
---
Now will you help me
 in this, and?
---
I've told ye,
---
you can
---
I'm so bad at letters."


---
I will."


---
Now I told you quite all yet.
---
I am some sort of relation by marriage
---
you do?--I
---
I think.
---
I'd run the risk, and
---
I am not going.
---
it will help us, but
---
it will be more proper.
---
the interview ended
---
the Scotchman left
---
as
 I feel it a great relief, Farfrae,
---
You see now."


---
the Mayor of Casterbridge is not
---
it seems
---
I do.
---
I'm sorry for ye!"
---
Can it be!
---
it will go off so easily

God
 knows

The cottage which was in the upper or western
 part of the town, near the Roman wall, and the avenue which overshadowed
 it.
---
The evening sun seemed.
---
the hours grew later
---
the
 foliage screened from the upper parts
---
Beneath these sycamores on the
 town walls could be seen from the sitting- room the tumuli and earth
 forts of the distant uplands
---
a past- marked prospect lends

the daughter was not indoors
---
there was room for
 wonder
---
the flesh is weak; and
---
the true
 explanation came in due course.

" O Michael!"
---
I am afraid all this is taking up your time and
 giving trouble-- when I did not expect any such thing
---
This is only a
 cottage
---
it costs me next to nothing.
---
I've never been
 able to lay hands on before
---
I've had for these last
 twenty years
---
the
 masterful, coercive Mayor of the town was
---
enervated by the
 genteel widow Mrs. Newson
---
That was
 inexplicable, except on the ground that the engagement was a family
 affair in which sentimental passion had no place
---
it was known.
---
they were related in some way
---
when
 they passed together along the Walks
---
the avenues on the walls
 were named--
---
these restitutory acts brought in their train
---
It was a windless
 morning of warm November rain, which floated down like meal, and.
---
Few people had
 gathered round the church door.

---
they were
---
who assisted as groomsman
---
The Scotchman, was of course the only one
 present, beyond the chief actors, who knew the true situation of the
 contracting parties.
---
they knew nothing of the secret;
---
But though, as the
 time for coming out of church drew on they gathered on the pavement
, and.


---
I had my settlement in this here town,

I'd marry

I would n't say it for all the world-- but

a was a poor parish' prentice,

that began life wi' no more belonging to
' en than a carrion crow
---
who had asked for another song
 at the Three Mariners
---
Mother Cuxsom said," how's this?

---
I have not.
---
Cuxsom's gone, and

the blessing of God leather breeches shall go."


---
yet I'll lay my life."


---
I'm

that kept us so low upon ground-- that great hungry family
---
Where the pigs be

the wash runs thin."


---
And dostn't mind?" continued Mrs.
 Cuxsom,;" and

we used,

I do

I do!

There's a blue- beardy look about' en; and' twill out

Some folk want.

The plain little brougham drove off in the mist, and

the idlers
 dispersed.

 many miles from here' tis

Knowledge-- the result of great

To

I wo n't be too gay on any account
---
It would
 be and."


---
it plain edged, with a little ivory ring for
 keeping it closed
---
It was odd about the necessity for that sunshade.
---
I happened
---
to have the ribbon by me so I made it up
---
that arched like
 a white rainbow from ear to ear
---
All in front of this line was covered
 with a thick encampment of curls all behind was dressed smoothly, and
.


---
The three members of the family were sitting at breakfast one day, and

---
I thought
 Elizabeth- Jane's hair?"
---
-- didn't you tell me
---
Elizabeth- Jane's hair
 promised
---
Did I?
---
I nearly forgot myself just now!
---
I meant
---
What was,."


---
it would be darker
---
It did; but
---
they alter so
---
Their hair gets darker-- but
---
I know
---
I was n't aware"


---
it lightened ever?
---
the future held the key
---
It passed.
---
Now I want.
---
people do it already in
 carelessness
---
I do n't like t'other name at all for my own flesh and blood.
---
I'll
 advertise it in the Casterbridge paper
---
that's the way they do it.
---
Surely if you must wish it as much as I?"


---
us do it by all means
---
it might have been
 called falsely, but.
---
Can you
 agree--
---
I'll think of it, mother
---
Do you wish this change so very much,
 sir
---
Why my blessed fathers, make about
 a trifle!
---
I proposed it
---
that's all.
---
I care
---
you do
---
Now you understand, do n't' ee
 go agreeing to it to please me."


---
Here the subject dropped, and
---
nothing more was said, and
---
nothing was

---
it had never thriven before
---
It had formerly moved in jolts
---
now it went on oiled casters.
---
bargains were made by the tongue alone
---
Letters and ledgers took the place of" I'll do't," and" you shall
 hae't"; and, as in all such cases of advance
---
the rugged picturesqueness
 of the old method disappeared with its inconveniences.


---
so
 it commanded a view of the hay- stores and granaries across the
 garden--
---
it had won at the first hour of their meeting
---
The poor
 opinion, and but ill- concealed, that was.


---
they
 stood in the doorway between the garden and yard,
---
Od damn it
---
what's all the world!

---
I like a fellow to talk to.
---
Casterbridge as has been hinted was a place deposited in the
 block upon a corn- field.
---
There was no suburb in the modern sense, or
 transitional intermixture of town and down.
---
It stood, with regard to the
 wide fertile land adjoining, clean- cut and distinct, like a chess- board
 on a green tablecloth.
---
reapers
 at work among the sheaves nodded to acquaintances standing on the
 pavement- corner
---
that floated in at the window
 from the remainder of the flock browsing hard by
---
; the red- robed judge,,
 pronounced sentence to the tune of Baa,; and stood in a meadow immediately before the drop, out of
 which.


---
the cows had been temporarily driven
---
The corn grown on the upland side of the borough.
---
was garnered by farmers
 who lived in an eastern purlieu called Durnover
---
Here wheat- ricks
 overhung the old Roman street, and
---
Barns
 indeed were so numerous as to alternate with every half- dozen houses
 along the way.
---
who daily walked the fallow
---
ruled by a mayor and corporation
---
which had nothing urban in it whatever
---
A street of farmers' homesteads-- a
 street, yet echoing with the thump of
 the flail was the Durnover end of Casterbridge.


---
when arrangements were in progress for getting home corn from
 one of the aforesaid farms
---
Elizabeth- Jane received a note by hand,
.
---
this was the granary
---
The granary
 was just within the farm- yard, and.
---
persons to walk under
---
The gates were open, but
---
nobody was within.

---
some wish.
---
a few drops of rain beginning
---
This situation began, and
---
the
 more awkward it became
---
I did n't know.
---
you were there
---
I have kept the appointment, and
."


---
I did n't know
---
it was you

---
who wished
---
But to see me otherwise I-- wished?
---
O no-- at least, that is I am afraid there may be
 a mistake."


---
Did n't you ask me?
---
Did n't you write this?"
---
Indeed would I have thought of it!
---
didn't
 you ask me?
---
This is not your writing?"
---
is that really so!
---
Then it's somebody wanting to see us both.

---
Perhaps we would do well."


---
they lingered
---
Acting on this consideration Elizabeth- Jane's face being
 arranged to an expression of preternatural composure, and
---
They watched individual drops of rain creeping down the
 thatch of the opposite rick-- straw after straw--; but
---
they reached the
 bottom
---
nobody came, and
---
the granary roof began.

"
---
The person is not likely to be coming
---
It's a trick
 perhaps, and
---
if so it's a great pity."


---
It's true, Miss Newson.
---
We'll hear news of this some day.
---
it was
---
I would n't stand for it hindering myself;
 but you, Miss Newson----"


---
I do n't mind-- much."


---
They lapsed again into silence.
---
You are anxious to get back to
 Scotland
---
Why would I be?"


---
I only supposed
---
you might be from the song you sang at the Three
 Mariners-- about Scotland and home, I mean-- which you seemed to feel so
 deep down in your heart
---
so we all felt for you."


---
I did sing there--
---
I did----But
---
it always did
---
your eyes get quite tearful
---
you finish it, and for all you
 felt you do n't mind it or think of it again for a long while.
---
I do n't want!
---
I'll sing the song to you wi' pleasure
 whenever you like.
---
I could sing it now, and?"


---
I fear."


---
I must go-- rain or no
---
ye had
---
the person should say anything to you,."
---
you did not mind it
---
you'll take the
 clever person's laugh away
---
There's husks and dust on you.

---
Perhaps you do n't know it?
---
it's very bad.

---
rain come upon clothes
---
when there's chaff on them
---
It washes in and.
---
me help you
---
Let blowing is the best."


---
now I'll go and
---
it is true,

---
The truth is:" The virgin that loveth to go gay."


---
nothing is more insidious
 than the evolution of wishes from mere fancies, and of wants from mere
 wishes.
---
It was now absolutely necessary to finish
---
the
 whole structure was at last complete.


---
Everybody was attracted, and
---
some said;
.

---
it had been done on purpose
---
it had its result
---
It
 is the first time in my life that I have been so much admired
---
perhaps it is by those whose admiration is not worth
 having
---
altogether the time was an
 exciting one
---
" Good Heaven whispered,"?
---
can it be
---
Here am I setting up as the town beauty!"


---
There is something wrong in all this
---
they only knew!
---
I am--
---
I ca n't
 talk Italian, or
---
they
 learn at boarding schools,
---
how they would despise me
---
that was now so generally observable
 in their intercourse.
---
evinced by these two
---
that
 was
---
yet the seed to lift the foundation of this friendship was at that moment.


---
It was about six o'clock
---
whose mouth fell ajar on the slightest provocation,.
---
seemingly
 there was no chin
---
what was coming next
---
You see, and

---
what's
---
you hear, and"

" Yes, sir."
---
I say
---
you know.
---
I'm not going
---
who had
---
that had been purchased
---
As was one of those to accompany the waggons
 into the country to fetch away stacks this
 affliction of was productive of much inconvenience.
---
It now remained.


---
what would
 happen to- morrow
---
Six o'clock struck, and
---
six entered the yard
---
this was the last time
---
There is sommit wrong in my make, your worshipful!"
---
my poor dumb brain gets as dead as
 a clot afore
---
I've said my few scrags of prayers.
---
it came on as a
 stripling,
---
I never enjoy my bed
 at all,
---
do I lie down.
---
I be asleep, and
---
I be
 awake
---
I be up
---
I've fretted my gizzard green about it, maister, but
---
can I do?
---
Now afore I went to bed
---
last night, I only had a scantling o'
 cheese and--
---
I do n't want!"
---
the waggons must
 start at four, and
---
you're not here
---
I'll mortify thy
 flesh for thee!"


---
me clear up my points
---
But let your worshipful---- turned away.

"
---
then a would n't hear my
 points
---
The journey to be taken by the waggons next day.

---
after all I've said?
---
Now I'll carry out my word, by
 my blessed fathers--
---
nothing else will do him any good!
---
I'm going up that
 way."


---
the inmates had
 nothing to lose
---
you leave my employ to- day!
'
---
's this?"
---
so be I did n't get up sooner, and
---
Ye see
---
things do

---
I be
---
I shall kill myself afterwards
---
I ca n't
 outlive the disgrace,!
---
You know, Maister
 Farfrae, and
---
how I feel such things
---
how forlorn thoughts get.
---
I shall do
 myself harm
---
Yes-- I feel!"


---
it coming on
---
ye go not
---
If you'll ha'e your death!"


---
I'm afeard I must n't!
---
I am
---
I say."


---
this joke has been carried far enough
---
I say it hasn't!
---
Not I am manager
---
I march
 out of this yard for good."


---
their eyes met.
---
It is tyrannical and no worthy of you."


---
It is!"
---
Why did you speak to me before them like that, Farfrae
---
You might have
 stopped.
---
we were alone
---
I know why!
---
I've told ye the secret o'
 my life-- fool and
---
I was--
---
you take advantage of me!"


---
I had forgot it
---
some oats should be
 hoisted to an upper floor or not
---
there could be no doubt of it.
---
who had

---
the daughters of a deceased farmer in Durnover wanted
 an opinion of the value of their haystack, and.
---
who was a child
---
The messenger, met
 in the yard not Farfrae, but Henchard.


---
I'll come."


---
said the child.


---
I am going that way....
---
I suppose."


---
because that's
---
they say
---
I see?
---
that's hey
---
they say--
---
that's just it, sir-- some of it."


---
there's more?
---
Of course there's more!
---
And better tempered, and they say.

---
they said,'
---
And a- walking home-- says they.
---
they said,'.
---
them by long chalks
---
I wish
---
they
 said.
---
They'll talk any nonsense
---
you can go now.
---
I am coming"
---
do
 they?
---
They walked on
 together,.


---
You're no yoursel' the day?"
---
I am very well
---
" But ye are a bit down surely ye are down?
---
Why there's nothing to be
 angry about!'
---
we've got from Blackmoor Vale
---
the people in Durnover want."


---
their hay valued
---
I am going there."


---
I'll go with ye."


---
as I wo n't go on with such as that
---
How could
 I forget?"


---
Do you care so very much about hurting folks' feelings?"
---
You do
---
I know-- especially mine!"


---
I am sorry
---
I have hurt yours, sir
---
Why should you say it
---
I have been hearing things that vexed me
---
that made me
 short in my manner.
---
me overlook
---
you really are
---
Now I do n't
 want
---
, to go in here about this hay-- Farfrae you can do it better than I.

---
They sent for' ee, too.
---
I have at eleven, and' tis drawing on for't."


---
They parted thus in renewed friendship,.
---
there was now again; and yet,
---
there was
 little change.


---
Thus their lives rolled on till a day of public rejoicing.


---
that had

---
Casterbridge slow made no response.
---
they might
 charge admission at the rate of so much a head
---
you like
---
what should be done on
 this holiday
---
However it was not too late; and
---
they quite readily agreed,.


---
the majority being fine old crusted
 characters who had a decided taste for living without worry
---
a Scotchman!--who is going?"
---
the Mayor intended
---
The diversions which to provide were.


---
Everybody applauded the Mayor's proposed entertainment,
---
when
 it became
---
Close to the town was an elevated green spot surrounded by an ancient
 square earthwork--.
---
earthworks square and not square, were as common as
 blackberries hereabout--
---
a spot whereon
---
the Casterbridge people usually
 held any kind of merry- making, meeting, or sheep- fair that required more
 space than the streets
---
it sloped to the river
 Froom, and from any point
---
a view was obtained of the country round
 for many miles.
---
This pleasant upland was.


---
games of all sorts would take place here; and
---
They erected greasy- poles for
 climbing, with smoked hams and local cheeses at the top.
---
They placed
 hurdles in rows for jumping over
---
they laid a slippery
 pole, with a live pig of the neighbourhood tied at the other end,.
---
who could walk over and
---
There
 were donkeys for the same, a
 stage for boxing, wrestling, and drawing blood generally; sacks for
 jumping in.
---
The tables were laid parallel with the inner
 slope of the rampart, and
---
awnings were stretched overhead.


---
rick- cloths of different sizes
 and colours being hung up to the arching trees without any regard to
 appearance
---
The morning came.
---
which had been remarkably clear down to
 within a day or two
---
The sky, was overcast, and the weather threatening, the wind
 having an unmistakable hint of water in it.
---
it was
 too late to modify or postpone, and
---
the proceedings went on.
---
the rain began,.
---
it was difficult
---
exactly when dry
 weather ended or
---
wet established itself
---
the slight moisture
 resolved itself into a monotonous smiting of earth by heaven, in
 torrents to which no end could be prognosticated.


---
The hams at the top of the poles dripped watered smoke in the
 form of a brown liquor shivered in the wind
---
, the pig the grain of the
 deal tables showed through the sticking tablecloths, for the awning
.
---
the rain to drift under at its will, and
---
The landscape over the
 river disappeared
---
the wind played on the tent- cords in aeolian
 improvisations, and.


---
the whole
 erection slanted to the ground
---
who had taken shelter within it

---
the storm abated, and
---
a drier breeze shook the moisture
 from the grass bents.
---
It seemed possible.
---
The awning was set up again
---
the band was called out from its
 shelter, and
---
where the tables had stood
---
a place
 was cleared for dancing.

"
---
The shops are all shut.
---
Why do n't they come?"


---
who stood in the field with the Mayor
---
A few I suppose.
---
All out of doors are there."


---
Then they! walked away moodily.
---
One or two young fellows gallantly came; but
---
there
 were no spectators, and
---
as the food to be distributed
 among the poor people of the town.
---
nothing was left in
 the field but a few hurdles, the tents, and the poles.


---
It was now dusk.
---
the tendency of all
 promenaders was towards a particular spot in the Walks, and
---
when the Mayor reached it
---
a gigantic tent had been

---
The densest point of the
 avenue of sycamores had been selected,
---
where the boughs made a closely
 interlaced vault overhead
---
the canvas had been hung, and
.
---
a barrel roof was the result
---
The end towards the wind was enclosed
---
the
 other end was open.
---
it was like the nave of a cathedral with.
---
one removed, but

---
the scene within was anything but devotional
---
A reel or fling of some
 sort was in progress; and
---
All the town crowded to the Walk,.
---
such a delightful idea of a ballroom
 never having occurred to the inhabitants before
---
Nature had been advised by Correggio in their creation
---
The dancing
 progressed with unabated spirit, and
---
it was worse, for there
---
to keep in the
 light," said one.

---
folk would go up to that
 bleak place to- day
---
The other answered.
---
people said
---
it was not only in such things as
 those that the Mayor was wanting
---
it were not for this young fellow
---
that sometimes used
---
people could fairly tell the
 breed--
---
nobody would dream the
 smallest four- legged beast had walked over it once
---
the care Mr. Henchard has!"
 
---
concluded this gentleman.


---
It was soon over, and
---
Look here was elsewhere,".
---
I'll go to Port- Bredy Great
 Market to- morrow myself
---
You can stay and."
---
Some other townsmen came up, and
---
's this,
 Henchard
---
What said Alderman Tubber,.
---
where you made the mistake
---
the lawyer, another goodnatured friend,
" was in going so far afield
---
you did n't think of it; and
---
you see
---
that's."


---
my manager is drawing to a close-- isn't it, Farfrae?"


---
they were clear verbal inscriptions
---
when people deplored the fact, and
---
why it was
---
it was till a hint from a nodding acquaintance enlightened
 her
---
The latter moved on into the dark dense old avenues, or rather
 vaults of living woodwork, which ran along the town boundary, and.


---
it's you,."
---
I've been looking for ye everywhere!
---
imparted by the estrangement with the
 corn- merchant
---
May I walk on with you as far as your street- corner?"


---
there might be something wrong in this
---
So together they went on, first down the West Walk, and
 then into the Bowling Walk,."


---
It's
---
I'm going

---
we'll not concern
 ourselves about it
---
But it is for the best.
---
I hoped."


---
you do!
---
It's the feeling for it rather than the learning of
 steps that makes pleasant dancers....
---
I fear!
---
now perhaps I'll have'
 the warrld altogether!"


---
darkness makes people truthful, and
---
the Scotchman went on
 impulsively--
---
I wish
---
I was richer
---
your stepfather had not been

---
But offended I would ask you something in a short time-- yes
---
I would ask
 you to- night.
---
that's not for me!"


---
Thus they
 continued their promenade along the walls
---
they got near the bottom
 of the Bowling Walk
---
afraid one of another till twenty steps further the trees would end,
 and.
---
the street- corner and lamps appear
---
they
 stopped.


---
I never found out
---
it was
---
that sent us to Durnover granary on a
 fool's errand that day
---
Did ye
 ever know yourself, Miss Newson?"


---
I wonder!"


---
why they did it
---
Perhaps it was not for fun.
---
It might have been?
---
they thought
---
they
 would like us
---
I
 hope."


---
you Casterbridge folk will not forget me
---
I go
---
I'm sure we wo n't
---
I wish."


---
you would n't go
 at all
---
They had got into the lamplight."
---
Now I'll think over that
---
I'll not come up to your door; but part from you
 here
---
They parted,.
---
Elizabeth- Jane going up the street
---
am I at?
---
nobody was there
---
It was quickly known in Casterbridge.
---
the muslin, the spencer, the
 sandals, the para- sol-- and looked in the mirror
---
The picture glassed back

---
how plain and homely was
 the informing spirit of that pretty outside
---
such dreams are not for you
---
It was in
 the town- hall, after a council meeting,.
---
These tones showed.


---
we are not
---
are we?'
---
Od send,
---
I stuck out for no terms--
---
I said' Name
 your own price.'
---
I'd have shared my last crust with that young fellow
 at one time
---
I ca n't overbid such a stripling
---
We'll show!"


---
we know our business as
 well as one here and there
---
they had collectively profited by this quality of
---
While the
 corn- factor's they had been made.
---
Nothing to find fault with
---
Only I
 want, my dear.
---
I've
 seen.
---
I have promised him nothing."


---
All's.
---
that ends well
---
I particularly wish."


---
You promise?"


---
then you much wish it.
---
I do.
---
SIR,--I make request that henceforth you and my stepdaughter be as
 strangers to each other.
---
I trust
---
therefore you will not attempt.


---
One would almost have supposed.
---
such a scheme for buying
 over a rival had nothing to recommend it to the Mayor's headstrong
 faculties.
---
There was
---
The town was small, but
---
the corn and
 hay- trade was proportionately large, and
---
which should seem like
 trade- antagonism to the Mayor
---
it's not.
---
I am sorry to disappoint you, but
---
the Scotchman's trade increased.

---
it were
---
it was sheer luck
---
Whether that whether the
 fact remained.
---
ringstraked- and- spotted would multiply and
---
most probably had little to do with it.
---
Character is Fate
---
said
 Novalis, and
---
it would be as well

---
Thus the incipient attachment was stifled down.


---
A time came.
---
their war of prices began

---
As soon as everybody was interested, and
---
some guessed the end.
---
It was, in some
 degree,.


---
Northern insight matched against Southern doggedness-- was one which, if it did not
 deal ruin at the first or second stroke,
---
they encountered each other amid the crowd of
 farmers which thronged about the market- place in the weekly course of
 their business.
---
The large farmers, corn- merchants, millers, auctioneers,
 and others had each an official stall in the corn- market room, with
 their names and
---
are you, too, my
 enemy?"





---
the box foresees the approaching jerk from some channel
 across the highway
---
Bedtime came,
 and
---
they burnt a light all night.
---
who had been staying up
---
The writer said.
---
how impossible it would
 be
---
therefore I quite forgive you for
 landing me in such a dilemma,; and.
---
you concealed nothing
 before our ill- advised acquaintance
---
I thus look upon the whole as a misfortune
 of mine, and not a fault of yours.

"
---
So I must ask you.
---
I
 pestered you day after day in the heat of my feelings
---
They were
 written; but
---
I thought your conduct to me cruel
---
now I know more
 particulars of the position you were in.
---
I see.


---
how inconsiderate my
 reproaches were
---
I am sure
---
Now you will perceive
---
which will
 make any future happiness possible for me
---
the one condition is
---
the past connection
 between our lives be kept secret outside this isle
---
I know

---
you will not
---
I can trust you.
---
One safe- guard
 more remains--.
---
no writings of mine, or trifling
 articles belonging to me should be left in your possession through
 neglect or forgetfulness
---
may I request you
---
any such you may have, particularly the letters written in the first
 abandonment of feeling.


---
you forwarded to me as a plaster to the wound I
 heartily thank you.


---
I am now on my way to Bristol,.
---
I hope.
---
I shall return through Casterbridge
 and Budmouth,.
---
where I shall take the packet- boat
---
Can you meet me with
 the letters and other trifles?
---
I shall be in the coach which changes
 horses at the Antelope Hotel at half- past five Wednesday evening
---
I
 shall be wearing a Paisley shawl with a red centre, and
---
I should prefer this plan of receiving them to having them

---
sent.--I remain still, yours
---
you had not known me!

---
ever I should be left in a position to
 carry out that marriage with thee
---
if I OUGHT--
---
Upon my heart and soul,, to do it I ought!"


---
there could be no great harm in acquiescing thus far
---
The evening was chilly, and
---
the coach was late.
---
the horses were being changed
---
something had happened
---
To learn to take the universe seriously there is no quicker
 way than to watch--.

---
people call it
---
the last toss- pot went by and
---
it seemed
---
that should release them from terrestrial
 constraint
---
You remember the note sent to you and Mr. Farfrae-- asking you to
 meet some one in Durnover Barton-- and
---
you thought
---
it was a trick to
 make fools of you
---
It was
---
not to make fools of you it was done.
'
---
Twas I did it."


---
I wanted."


---
I had a reason.'
---
I wish!
---
it could have been in
 my time
---
there is!
---

Perhaps they'll be friends again

I do n't know
---
I do n't know."
---
the blinds were all down
---
there were
---
it was purer from that original fount
 than from their own wells
---
And said Mrs. Cuxsom.
---
that wanted
---
when I'm gone
---
my last
 breath blowed look in the top drawer o' the chest in the back room
 by the window, and
---
you'll find all my coffin clothes, a piece of
 flannel--
---
's, that's, and
---
the little piece is; and
---
they are folded alongside, and
 all my other things.
---
there's four ounce pennies, the heaviest I
 could find, a- tied up in bits of linen, for weights-- two for my right
 eye and two for my left
---
when you've used'em, and
---
my
 eyes do n't open no more,
---
do n't ye go

---
bury the pennies, good souls and spending'em, for I should n't like it.
---
I
 am carried out
---
you can

Martha did it, and.

---
ye'll believe words,.'
---
Faith said,'?
---
why
 should death rob life o' fourpence
---
Death's not of such good report that
 we should respect' en to that extent
---
I say it
 to- day, and
---
I would n't speak wrongfully for
 a zilver zixpence at such a time.
---
I do n't see noo harm in it.
---
To respect
 is sound doxology; and
---
I would n't sell skellintons--
---
I were
 out o' work
---
money is scarce, and
---
throats get dry.
---
Why SHOULD death
 rob life o' fourpence?
---
I say."


---
there was no treason in it
---
did n't wish seen anybody
 will see; and
---
It was and a
 restless, acrobatic flame, poised on a coal, called from the shady walls
 the smiles of all shapes that could respond-- the old pier- glass, with
 gilt columns and huge entablature, the picture- frames, sundry knobs and
 handles, and the brass rosette at the bottom of each riband bell- pull on
 either side of the chimney- piece.


---
the candles were not lighted,
---
do you think much of old times
---
Who do put in your pictures of' em?"


---
I ca n't think it
---
only one of them could possibly be recalled, and
---
you were related by marriage.
---
you knew me
---
Then my task would not
 have been such a hard one....
---
Shame alone prevented your wretched parents from
 owning this to you while both of'em were alive."


---
I'd rather
 have your scorn, your fear, anything than your ignorance;' tis that I
 hate!
---
when we were young
---
you
 saw
---
What was our second marriage.
---
We had thought
 each other dead-- and
---
which strangely corroborated
---
I ca n't
 bear it
---
I wo n't bear it
---
why should you cry?
---
Am I so
 dreadful, so hateful to' ee?
---
I'll do anything,!"


---
I do n't want
---
you to come to me all of a sudden
---
I do n't.

---
I'll go away and or
---
when you like, and
---
then
 I'll show' ee papers.
---
There I am gone, and
---
that chose your name
---
twas I gave you your name!"
 
---
You'll take my surname now-- hey?

---
it will be much more pleasant to me.
'
---
you know
---
nobody need.
---
You shall take
 it as if by choice.
---
I'll talk to my lawyer
---
I do n't know the law of it
 exactly; but
---
will you do this?"


---
me put a few lines into the newspaper

---
such is
---
it is my name
---
If I must have it
---
must n't I
---
usage is everything in these matters."


---
I wonder?"


---
I shall tell you
---
's have a light
---
I can see by the firelight
---
It was done, and.


---
tenderness softened it

---
this time--"I'll go upstairs and
---
that will
 prove it all to you
---
I wo n't trouble you with them till to- morrow.

---
it all
 meant
---
were it emotive or.
---
were
 it choleric--
---
which was folded
 and
---
The seal had cracked, and
---
the letter was open.

---
I have kept one thing
 a secret from you till now.
---
I hope
---
you will understand
---
why I think;
---
you
 will
---
perhaps you may not forgive me.
---
I have
 done it for the best.
---
I shall be in my grave, and

---
when you read this
---
Elizabeth- Jane will have a home.
---
Do n't curse me Mike think of how I was
 situated.
---
I can hardly write it, but
---
here it is.
---
Elizabeth- Jane is not
 your Elizabeth- Jane-- the child who was in my arms when you sold me.

---
I felt at the other's loss.
---
I
 am dying, and
---
I might have held my tongue; but
---
I could not.
---
you may judge
---
you can
---
you once deeply wronged
---
it were a window- pane
---
simply moody I am
---
to consider whether
 affliction being a" to suffer I perceive."
---
This
 much scourging then is for me."
---
the blasting disclosure was
---
I wonder
---
it is true
---
They were fair
---
this was an unimportant preliminary.

---
Misery taught him nothing more than defiant endurance of it.
---
the first impulse for revenge died with the thought.
---
the concatenation of events this evening had produced
---
they
 had developed naturally.
---
The mockery was,.


---
infernal harpies had snatched up the food.
---
These precincts embodied the mournful phases of Casterbridge life,.
---
the south avenues embodied its cheerful moods
---
The whole way along here
 was sunless, even in summer time
---
white frosts lingered here

---
when other places were steaming with warmth
---
; in spring, it was the
 seed- field of all the aches, rheumatisms, and.
---
The Casterbridge doctors must have pined away for want of
 sufficient nourishment but for the configuration of the landscape on the
 north- eastern side.


---
The river-- ran beneath a low cliff.
---
the two together forming a
 defence which had rendered walls and artificial earthworks on this side
 unnecessary
---
Here were ruins of a Franciscan priory, and
---
the water of which roared down a back- hatch like the voice
 of desolation.
---
It was like a pedestal lacking its statue.
---
This missing feature, without
 which remained incomplete
---
the extensive
 buildings at the back being the county gaol
---
whenever an execution
 took place, and
---
they stood and

---
Why did I come here
---
that calling was monopolized over all England by a
 single gentleman
---
long-- possibly for ever Elizabeth- Jane seeming
---
The morning came after this night of unrest, and with it the necessity
 for a plan.
---
especially it would involve humiliation
---
I have thought and
---
I
 see.
---
everything must be
---
you say
---
I am going.

---
you are,
---
It is so plain to me now.
---
Indeed it is.
---
you
 would not have done half the things you have done for me, and!
---
me
 have my own way so entirely
---
I had only been
 your step- daughter
---
married by such
 a strange mistake
---
Now breakfast is ready!"
---
The moment and the act prefigured for weeks with a thrill of pleasure; yet
---
the fruition of the
 whole scheme was such dust and ashes as this.





---
an agitation
 half; yet was constrained.


---
The coldness soon broke out into open chiding.
---
It was dinner- time."


---
they never met except at meals-- and
---
you'll bide
---
where you be a minute, father
---
If
 I'll get it
---
where you be
---
you only fit,
---
ye use such words as those
---
I meant' in a low, humble
 voice.
---
where you are,
---
I ought."


---
it came
---
they walked together," but
---
they were" engaged"
---
These improvements however are somewhat in advance of the story.

---
It was not.


---
Here Elizabeth- Jane said,.
---
I tell you
---
I am a poor tool with a pen."


---
so be I
---
Be jowned, and said the gentleman.


---
Now then--'An agreement entered into this sixteenth day of
 October'--write that first."


---
other ideas
 reigned then
---
bristling characters were as innate
 and
---
when a field of corn
      Bows all its ears before the roaring East
---
Elizabeth- Jane produced a line of chain- shot and sand- bags
---
I'll
 finish it
---
Phoebe come up twice
---
when the cat overturned the coal- scuttle
---
Do n't I pay her a dozen pound a year?"
---
These domestic exhibitions were the small protruding needlerocks which
 suggested rather than revealed what was underneath.
---
The more interesting that the more seemed.
---
the most terrible ordeal was.
---
who worked in the yard
---
there was
 no clear spot on which to deposit the provisions
---
Why do you lower yourself so confoundedly?
---
Haven't I told you o't fifty times?
---
Why ye'll
 disgrace me to the dust!"


---
I can let!"


---
' waited on worse
---
It is not true!"
---
whose complexion now lost nearly all of the former colour.
---
does this
 mean?
---
Anything or nothing? is true
---
""

" It said Elizabeth- Jane.
---
it was?
---
only-- Did you do it, or
---
did n't you
---
Where was it?"


---
when we were

---
that
 must have been caused by such a fact
---
I am not
---
it shall be by no
 fault of my own
---
it seemed
---
Winter had almost come, and
---
there were certain early winter
 days in Casterbridge-- days of firmamental exhaustion which followed
 angry south- westerly tempests-- when, if the sun shone, the air was like
 velvet.
---
whose curious feature was this, its continuity as a
 place of sepulture
---
who lay
---
who
 held in their mouths coins of Hadrian, Posthumus, and the Constantines
---
Business had long since passed down them into its daily cells, and

---
Leisure had not arrived there.
---
So Elizabeth- Jane walked and.


---
This figure too was reading; but not
 from a book: the words which engrossed.
---
Indeed comparatively indifferent as Elizabeth- Jane was,
.
---
the lady had come from
---
which mostly prevailed there
---
the simple and the mistaken, equally avouched.


---
Interesting things had been out of doors
---
as it turned out.
---
whose two years' mayoralty was ending,
.
---
This caused the unfortunate discovery.
---
Mrs. Stannidge seemed
---
the cheerful souls at the Three Mariners
 having exhausted its aspects long ago
---
Peerage of burghers-- as expected, and
---
where have you been
---
I've been strolling in the Walks and churchyard, father,."
---
I feel
 quite leery
---
This was just enough to incense Henchard after the other crosses of the
 day.
---
I WON'T have!
---
you talk like that
---
One would think!
---
you worked upon a farm
---
I learn.
---
you lend
 a hand in public- houses
---
Then I hear.
---
you talk like a clodhopper
---
I'm
 burned,
---
it goes on
---
if this house ca n't hold us two."


---
it means
 peace, and a marriage portion
---
not I do n't want
---
my house to be

---
I do n't wish,
---
I therefore withdraw my objection.


---
the business be not carried on in my house.--

 Yours,

 M. HENCHARD
---
The morrow, being fairly fine found Elizabeth- Jane again in the
 churchyard, but.
---
I wish!"


---
was a little promenade under the wall where people
 sometimes walked instead of on the gravel.
---
The bench seemed
---
to be
 touched by something
---
Elizabeth- Jane looked,."
---
I heard
 you
---
Yes, said the lady, in a vivacious voice,.
---
What can
 have happened?"


---
I don't
---
I ca n't tell you
---
that had come
---
There was no movement or word for a few seconds
---
I guess
---
how it is with you
---
said the latter.
---
The lady's
 manner was so desirous, so anxious,.
---
there should
 be confidence
---
Yes, said Elizabeth- Jane.


---
There has been a disagreement?"

" A little."


---
Perhaps you were
---
to blame suggested the stranger.


---
I swept up the coals
; and
---
when the servants ought
---
I said."


---
I was
---
Do you know the
 impression?
---
your words give me
---
it has been very
 much.
---
it has lasted
---
All is owing to my defects
---
I daresay;
 and."


---
my defects are owing to my history
---
is your history?"


---
My history is not gay or attractive
---
yet I can tell it,."


---
you really want
---
which was in general the
 true one,
---
the sale at the fair had no part therein
---
it was not.


---
I do n't know
---
I think of going away.
---
can I do?
---
Where can I go?"


---
Perhaps it will be better soon
---
So I would
 not go far.
---
Now do you think of this: I shall soon want somebody to
 live in my house, partly as housekeeper, partly as companion; would you
 mind coming to me?
---
I would indeed would do anything to be independent.
---
I am no accomplished person.
---
a companion to you must be that."


---
I ca n't help."


---
when I do n't mean
 to
---
Never mind I shall like."


---
I know
---
I sha n't
---
do!"--she cried with a distressful laugh.
---
I
 accidentally learned.
---
you want some one who can write that?"


---
where do you live?."


---
I shall be living here after twelve o'clock
 to- day
---
I have been staying at Budmouth for a few days.
---
my house
 was getting ready
---
I am going into
---
The house is that one they call
 High- Place Hall-- the old stone one looking down the lane to the market.

---
Two or three rooms are fit for occupation, though not all
---
I sleep there
 to- night for the first time.
---
Now will you think over my proposal, and
, and?"


---
you are still in
 the same mind
---
the two parted at the gate
 of the churchyard.





---
a maxim glibly repeated from childhood
---
As remains practically unmarked
 till some mature experience,
---
enforces it so did this High- Place Hall now
 really show itself to Elizabeth- Jane,.


---
that had become a common topic about the streets.
---
High- Place Hall
 was undergoing repair
---
a lady was coming there
---
; to live shortly people knew it, and.


---
The lady had arrived that day.


---
When the lamps were lighted, and
---
it was yet not so dark as to render
 chimneys, attics, and roofs invisible
---
The Hall, with its grey facade and parapet was the only residence of
 its sort so near the centre of the town.
---
It had, in the first place
---
the
 characteristics of a country mansion-- birds' nests in its chimneys,
 damp nooks where fungi grew and irregularities of surface direct from
 Nature's trowel.
---
the forms of passengers were patterned by the
 lamps in black shadows upon the pale walls.


---
motes of straw lay around, and
---
other signs of the premises
 having been in that lawless condition which accompanies the entry of a
 new tenant.
---
The house was entirely of stone, and.
---
It was not altogether aristocratic, still
 less consequential, yet
---
the old- fashioned stranger instinctively said
.


---
Blood built it, and
---
Yet as regards the enjoying it the stranger would have been wrong, for
 until this very evening, when the new lady had arrived
---
the house had
 been empty for a year or two.
---
its occupancy
 had been irregular
---
The reason of its unpopularity was soon made
 manifest.
---
Some of its rooms overlooked the market- place; and
---
such a
 prospect from such a house was not considered desirable or seemly by its
 would- be occupiers.


---
The lady
 had obviously arrived.
---
the architecture deserved admiration, or at least study, on its own
 account.
---
It was Palladian, and like most architecture erected since
 the Gothic age was a compilation rather than a design.
---
its
 reasonableness made it impressive.
---
It was not rich, but rich enough.
---
A
 timely consciousness of the ultimate vanity of human architecture, no
 less than of other human things, had prevented artistic superfluity.


---
packing- cases rendering the door and hall within like a public
 thoroughfare.
---
which had given her egress
---
it was arched and
 old--
---
The door was studded, and
---
the
 keystone of the arch was a mask.
---
Originally the mask had exhibited a
 comic leer.
---
as could still be discerned; but
---
the
 blows thereon had chipped off the lips and jaws
---
they had been
 eaten away by disease
---
The position of the queer old door and the odd presence of the leering
 suggested one thing above all others as appertaining to the
 mansion's past history-- intrigue.
---
it had been possible,
 the old bull- stake, the old cock- pit, the pool wherein nameless
 infants had been used to disappear.
---
High- Place Hall could boast of its
 conveniences undoubtedly.


---
which was
 down the alley,
---
the pedestrian on coming up made straight for the arched doorway
---
Much might have resulted
 from recognition--
---
it had changed
---
Absolute indifference had taken the place
 of irritability; and
---
my going away
---
Where are you going?"


---
I have heard of an opportunity of getting

---
where I can have
 advantages of study, and
---
you ca n't get
---
where you are
---
You do n't object?"


---
you wo n't
 have enough money for this lively scheme without help,
---
you know
---
I should be willing to make you an allowance,."


---
you not be

---
refined folk are likely to pay
' ee
---
It had
---
A small
 annuity is.
---
I should like
---
you to have---- and
---
I may be independent of you
---
Would that please ye?"


---
Then I'll see about it this very day."
---
they were concerned
---
as far as the
 matter was settled.
---
The day and came; but
---
a drizzling rain fell.
---
their mildewed leathers blacked, and.
---
the lady were not
 there
---
One side of the churchyard-- the side towards the weather-- was sheltered
 by an ancient thatched mud wall
---
whose eaves overhung as much as one or
 two feet.
---
The young lady had come.


---
Fancies find rooms in the strongest
 minds.
---
the rope of a
 flagstaff rattled in the wind
---
have you decided
---
you like
---
I had a good mind to send to you to come to
 my house,.
---
you might not venture up here in the wind
---
as I
 like getting out of doors I thought."


---
I would come and
---
It was my own thought."


---
That shows.
---
we shall agree
---
Then can you come to- day?
---
My house is so
 hollow and dismal that I want some living thing there."


---
I think
---
I might be able to
---
Voices were borne over to them at that instant on the wind and raindrops
 from the other side of the wall.
---
There came such words as" sacks,"
 " quarters,"" threshing,"" tailing,"" next Saturday's market," each
 sentence being disorganized by the gusts like a face in a cracked
 mirror.
---
said the lady.


---
The lady seemed.
---
where you were going to
---
how was that?"


---
I thought it safer to get away first--."


---
Perhaps you are right....
---
Besides I have never told you my name.
---
It is
 Miss Templeman....
---
Are they gone-- on the other side?"


---
They have only gone up into the granary."


---
it is getting damp here.
---
I shall expect you to- day at six."


---
shall I come, ma'am?"


---
There is no other that I have
 noticed."


---
Elizabeth- Jane had been thinking of the door in the alley.


---
you have not mentioned your destination
---
Perhaps, as you may as well
 keep silent upon it.
---
you are clear off
---
Who knows but?"


---
I do n't fear it
---
When they had emerged upon the open road and
---
parted they found enough
 to do in holding their bowed umbrellas to the wind.
---
Nevertheless the
 lady looked in at the corn- yard gates.
---
nothing was visible there and.


---
the humpbacked barn cushioned with moss,
---
the granary rising against
 the church- tower behind,
---
where the smacking of the rope against the
 flag- staff still went on
---
you said?
---
I might go, father
---
I thought.'
---
you meant next month, or next year
---
Od seize it
---
,
 you take time by the forelock!
---
This then is?"


---
how you be going

---
how can you speak like that?
---
It is unjust of you!"
---
It may be-- but
---
I've spoke roughly to
 you
---
I've been grieved beyond everything by you--
---
there's something
 that caused it."


---
have I done?"


---
I ca n't tell you now.
---
you'll stop, and
---
if go on living as my
 daughter I'll tell you all in time."


---
the proposal had come ten minutes too late.
---
as considerately as I
 think it best for us that I go on now
---
I need
---
not stay long I shall not
 be far away, and
---
you want me badly
---
if I can soon come back again."


---
You are not going
---
far you say.
---
What will be your address, in case
---
I
 wish?
---
am I not?"


---
It is only in the town-- High- Place Hall!"


---
It is.
---
I hope
---
your good and mine as I have come
---
,
, that to live at Casterbridge-- for how long
---
I
 can not tell
---
That depends upon another; and
---
Seriously I am not.
---
I may seem
---
you used
---
I knew
---
As soon as it was brought home to me very
 forcibly by my conscience.
---
I ought
---
my etourderie flung over my name
---
I hope, and.
---
you are of the same mind
---
you
 will take steps to this end
---
however I did not know, or
---
how you were
 situated
---
what had happened since our separation
---
I decided.


---
You probably feel as I do about this.
---
I shall be able to see you in a
 day or two.
---
P.S.--I was unable to keep my appointment to meet you for a moment or
 two in passing through Casterbridge the other day.
---
My plans were altered
 by a family event,.



---
it will surprise you
---
High- Place Hall was being prepared for
 a tenant
---
Who is coming
---
I believe,
---
I suppose,"
 
---
it was, indeed,
 with interest, if not warmth.
---
Miss Le
 Sueur was living there
---
Miss Templeman only had come
---
the same person could
 recall
---
the name of the rich
 relative whom had been given
 as Templeman
---
when material things increasingly possess the mind
---
had been shown by the torrent of letters after the
 fiasco in their marriage arrangements, and
---
when another note came to the Mayor's house from High- Place Hall
---
I am in residence" and comfortable
---
You probably know
---
I am going or
---
do you not?
---
My good Aunt Templeman, the banker's widow, whose
 very existence to doubt, has lately
 died, and.
---
I will not enter into
 details.


---
I am now my own mistress, and.
---
at least you may be put to no trouble

---
you wish
---
My first intention was; but
---
you should meet me in the street
---
I
 have thought better of this.


---
You probably are aware of my arrangement with your daughter, and.
---
Do you see, Michael,.
---
partly why I have done
 it?--why,
---
You may have done
 so in your haste, but
---
not deliberately I am sure.
---
they had grown dry
---
It was between eight and nine
 o'clock.
---
was; but.


---
Miss
 Templeman was engaged for that evening
---
That's rather like giving herself airs!
---
there's not an inch of straight grain in' em
---
it were a
 clue line, and
---
The room disclosed.
---
was a small table, with a pack of cards scattered upon it.


---
innate grace only prevented from being
 boisterous
---
you are late
---
There were so many little things to put up."


---
you seem dead- alive and tired.
---
me try
---
I have learnt
---
have you chosen?
---
I forgot."


---
I
 was thinking of-- you, and me-- and
---
how strange it is
---
I am here
---
Miss Templeman looked at Elizabeth- Jane with interest, and." Ah!
---
I'll lie here;
 and
---
you sit by me
---
we'll talk."


---
It could be seen
---
I must tell you something
---
I wonder.
---
you have suspected
 it
---
I have only been mistress of a large house and fortune a little
 while."


---
" Oh-- only a little while?" murmured.


---
I was quite flighty and unsettled
---
I
 should not have mentioned
---
this had
---
I not thought."


---
it best you should know
 the truth
---
whose large lustrous eyes had such
 an odd effect upside down
---
You
 speak French and Italian fluently, no doubt
---
I have not been
 able to get beyond a wretched bit of Latin yet."


---
speaking French does not go
 for much.
---
It is rather the other way."

" Where is your native isle?"


---
It was with rather more reluctance.

---
Miss Templeman said," Jersey
---
There they speak French on one side of the street and English on the
 other, and a mixed tongue in the middle of the road.
---
it is a long
 time since I was there.
---
Bath is.
---
where my people really belong to,
---
my ancestors in Jersey were as good as anybody in England
---
They were
 the Le Sueurs, an old family who have done great things in their time.

---
I went back and.
---
I do n't value
 such past matters, and."


---
a deliberately formed resolve had been broken.


---
It could not however have been broken in safer company.
---
Thy speech bewrayeth thee!"


---
which formed an
 animated scene
---
Here they surged on this one day of the week,
---
who conversing varied their attitudes much,

---
Their faces radiated tropical
 warmth; for though when at home their countenances varied with the
 seasons, their market- faces all the year round were glowing little
 fires.


---
they were an inconvenience, a
 hampering necessity
---
the majority were
 careless in that respect,.
---
which were historical
 records of their wearer's deeds, sun- scorchings, and daily struggles for
 many years past
---
which regulated at the bank hard by a balance of never less than four
 figures
---
these gibbous human shapes specially represented

---
It happened.

---
they grew on the spot
---
it was

---
who had often observed them
---
Elizabeth- Jane,, said,"?"


---
I wonder
---
the same
 trees come every week
---
whose
 face seemed?"


---
Do we speak to each other
---
Elizabeth- Jane sighed.


---
Are you particularly interested in anybody out there
---
said Elizabeth- Jane.


---
They are all farmers
---
I suppose
---
There's Mr. Bulge
---
-- there's Benjamin
 Brownlet-- a horse dealer; and Kitson, the pig breeder; and Yopper, the
 auctioneer; besides maltsters, and millers-- and so on."
---
The Saturday afternoon slipped on thus desultorily.
---
The market changed
 from the sample- showing hour to the idle hour before starting homewards,
.
---
when tales were told
---
The days came but
---
all that warm allegiance
, the then
 unfortunate issue of things had chilled pure love considerably.
---
now there was nothing to hinder it--
---
which
 was a happiness to sigh for
---
why their marriage should take place there
---
Tuesday was the great Candlemas fair.
---
I imagine
---
I suppose?"


---
You have quarreled more deeply than I know of."


---
where you are
---
I like your company much!"
---
that if now seemed
---
",
 as to
 be the case Elizabeth- Jane would have-- a disagreeable
 necessity.


---
A provisional resource suggested itself."
---
will you go on
 an errand for me as soon as breakfast is over?--Ah
---
that's very good of
 you.
---
Will you go and.

"
---
have you ever seen the Museum?"


---
Elizabeth- Jane had not.

"
---
Then you should do so at once.
---
You can finish the morning by going
 there.
---
It is an old house in a back street
---
I forget where-- but
---
you'll
 find out-- and.
---
there are crowds of interesting things-- skeletons, teeth,
 old pots and pans, ancient boots and shoes, birds' eggs-- all charmingly
 instructive
---
You'll be sure to stay till you get quite hungry."


---
I wonder!"
---
it was
---
The contents were.
---
briefly:--


 DEAR MICHAEL,--You will be standing in view of my house to- day for two
 or three hours in the course of your business,
---
I am sadly disappointed that you have not come before,
---
can I
 help
---
Your
 daughter's presence here may be the cause of your neglect; and.
---
I have

---
you come on business
---
Say I
 shall be quite alone.


---
When the messenger returned
---
it was necessary;
---
This was the best position after
 all, and
---
some other person had, indeed,

---
it was just too late to recede.


---
The visitor did not laugh half a wrinkle.


---
I'm very sorry!"
---
I came and
---
they showed me up here, and
---
would I have caught ye so unmannerly if I had known!"


---
I was the unmannerly one
---
is it madam?"
---
that I have come to the wrong house,
---
You must come and
---
you are here,"
 
---
Now this was not strictly true; but
---
there was no danger in it

---
there was
---
are men!--he hastened on to High- Place
 Hall
---
The fair to- day seems a large one
---
when their eyes sought the busy scene without
---
Your numerous
 fairs and markets keep me interested.
---
I think of
---
I
 watch from here
---
the babble without reached them
--."
---
they sat
---
voices as of wavelets on a looping sea, one ever and rising above the rest
---
Do you look out often?
---
Do you look for any one you know?"


---
I look as at a picture merely.
---
I may do so now
---
You are always there,
---
are
 you not?
---
I do n't mean it seriously!
---
it is amusing.
---
one knows in a crowd
---
It takes
 off the terrible oppressiveness of being surrounded by a throng, and
."


---
Maybe you'll be very lonely, ma'am?"


---
Nobody knows how lonely."


---
you are rich
---
But they say?"


---
If so I do n't know.
---
I came to.
---
Casterbridge
 thinking
---
I should like
---
I wonder."


---
I shall
---
did ye come from, ma'am?"


---
It's better,
 and
---
that's true; but.
---
It is a
 great pity, but
---
it's always so!
---
Yet I've done very well this year.
---
when wheat
 was down
---
then afterwards when it rose
---
I sold off all
 I had
---
It brought only a small profit to me;.
---
the farmers kept
 theirs,
---
the rats were gnawing
---
when I sold
---
Just the markets went lower, and
---
I bought up
 the corn of those who had been holding back at less price than my first
 purchases.
---
I
 sold it a few weeks after,
---
when it happened
---
so contenting mysel' with small profits frequently repeated
---
where made nothing at all
---
now I'm wearying you!
---
You are most interesting."


---
who showed the modest pink
---
I mean all you Scotchmen
---
We common people are all one way or the other-- warm
 or cold, passionate or frigid.
---
You have."


---
both temperatures going on in
 you at the same time
---
how do you mean that?
---
You are
---
animated then you are thinking of getting on.
---
You are sad the
 next moment
---
then you are thinking of Scotland and friends."

" Yes.
---
I think of home sometimes!
---
So do I-- as far as I can.
---
it was an old house where I was born, and

---
they pulled it down for improvements,
---
so I seem."


---
the house was in St.
 Helier, and not in Bath
---
the mountains, and the mists and the rocks they are there!
---
do n't they seem like home?"


---
They do to me
---
they do to me
---
its origin were national or personal
---
Whether it
 was quite true.
---
those contrasts
 could be seen not mingling.


---
You are wishing
---
you were back again
---
The fair without the windows was now raging thick and loud.
---
It was the
 chief hiring fair of the year, and.
---
it was a whitey- brown crowd.
---
white being the body of labourers
---
they too entered into
 the hiring.
---
now so bowed by hard work and years.
---
negotiations were proceeding
---
there seemed.


---
there was a difficulty.
---
The farmer would not take
 the crust without the crumb of the bargain, in other words
---
I'm sorry to leave ye, Nelly
---
you see
---
I shall never see' again!"
---
It was, indeed, a hopeless length
 of traction for Dan Cupid's magnet
---
I never shall
---
The farmer
 said.


---
It is very hard
---
Lovers ought!
---
I had my wish
---
if I'd let!"


---
people live and
---
Maybe I can manage
---
they'll not be parted
---
I want
 a young carter; and
---
you are so good!
---
me know
---
you have succeeded
---
The eyes of
 all brightened
---
the bargain was soon struck.
---
immediately it was concluded.


---
It is kind- hearted of you, indeed
---
I have
 resolved!
---
all my servants shall have lovers
---
they want them
---
I must be a
 little stricter than that
---
I am a struggling hay- and- corn
 merchant."


---
I cannet explain.
---
I do n't know; and
---
that's true
---
I try
!"


---
I see
---
you are
---
you say
---
Two farmers met and.


---
being quite near the window their
 remarks could be heard as others'
---
I've gone athwart and about
 the fair half- a- dozen times, and
---
I quite forgot the engagement
---
Now you must go
---
must you not?
---
You had
---
You will lose a customer.


---
Now you will make me angry
---
you do n't go
---
I like; but
---
I fear!
---
I must go
---
Business ought
---
" not to be neglected ought it?"


---
It's true.
---
I'll come another time--, ma'am?"


---
I may
---
What has happened to us to- day
---
is very curious."


---
Something to think over
---
when we are alone
---
it's?"


---
I do n't know that.
---
It is commonplace after all."


---
I'll not say that.
---
it has been
---
whatever it is now over; and
---
the market calls you."


---
I wish."


---
there were no business in the
 warrld
---
How you change
---
You should not change like this.


---
I have never wished such things before
---
It is only since
 coming here and seeing you!"


---
that's the case
---
If you had.
---
I feel!"


---
I have quite demoralized you
---
look or look not I will see you in my thoughts.
---
I'll
 go--."


---
Maybe I'll get into my market- mind,
---
when I've been out a few minutes
---
I do n't know
---
But I do n't know!"


---
You may hear
---
them speak of me in
 Casterbridge
---
time goes on
---
they tell you.
---
I'm a coquette, which
 some may, because of the incidents of my life, do n't believe it, for
---
I
 am not
---
If I swear!"
---
I will not
---
Why was
 this?
---
They could not have told.


---
it could fly and
---
it having
---
Three minutes later knocks, not
 of multitude but of strength sounded through the house, and
---
The Mayor said.


---
I have a headache
---
The message was taken down, and
---
a disturbing element changed
---
I'm so glad you've come.
---
You'll live with me a long time,
---
wo n't you?
---
it was not unpleasing.
---
The least would have been.


---
it afforded
---
The carrefour was like the regulation Open Place in spectacular
 dramas, where the incidents that occur always happen to bear on the
 lives of the adjoining residents.
---
Farmers, merchants, dairymen, quacks,
 hawkers appeared there from week to week, and.
---
the
 afternoon wasted away
---
It was the node of all orbits.


---
they did not live at all during the
 intervals.
---
Wherever they might go.
---
they were sure to be at home
---
they seldom saw
---
Thus things went on, till a certain market- morning.
---
when a parcel
 containing two dresses arrived for the latter from London
---
the gowns spread out on the bed,
---
I would n't think so hard about it
---
settling upon new clothes is so trying
---
You are
 that person"( pointing to one of the arrangements)," or," for the whole of the
 coming spring and one of the two
---
you are THAT
 totally different person"( pointing to the other)
---
you do n't know."


---
which may turn out
---
It was finally decided by Miss Templeman.
---
The dress was pronounced, and
---
The morning was exceptionally bright for the time of year.
---
there were
---
Suddenly after a rumbling
 of wheels, added to this steady light a fantastic series of
 circling irradiations upon the ceiling, and the companions turned to the
 window.
---
Immediately opposite a vehicle of strange description had come
 to a standstill,.


---
it had been placed there for exhibition
---
It was the new- fashioned agricultural implement called a horse- drill,
.
---
till then unknown where the venerable seed- lip was still used for sowing as in the days
 of the Heptarchy
---
Its arrival created about as much sensation in the
 corn- market as a flying machine.
---
The
 farmers crowded round it
---
children crept under and
 into it.
---
The machine was painted in bright hues of green, yellow, and
 red, and
---
it resembled as a whole a compound of hornet, grasshopper,
 and shrimp,.
---
it might have been likened to an
 upright musical instrument.
---
the front gone
---
That was.
---
Why it is a sort of agricultural piano
---
It has something to do with corn
---
I wonder?"


---
who thought of introducing it here
---
us go and
---
it is
---
Elizabeth- Jane's bonnet and shawl were pitchforked on in a moment, and

---
they went out.
---
They examined it curiously;
---
which tossed the seed into the upper ends of the tubes that conducted it
 to the ground
---
observing the rows of trumpet- shaped tubes
 one within the other, the little scoops, like revolving salt- spoons,
 somebody said," Good morning, Elizabeth- Jane."
---
Miss Templeman bowed.
---
I am
 happy to become acquainted with you, Mr. Henchard
---
This is a
 curious machine."


---
Who brought it here?
---
it should act
---
Twas brought here by one of our machinists on
 the recommendation of a jumped- up jackanapes of a fellow who thinks----"
 
---
The thing-- why' tis
 impossible.', and probably
 thinking.


---
the suit might be progressing
---
Then something seemed
---
You refused!"
---
indeed they might have been spoken to one of the yellow- gaitered
 farmers near them
---
then all thought of
 the incident was dissipated by the humming of a song, which sounded
 as though from the interior of the machine.
---
The hummed song went on--

     "' Tw-- s on a s-- m-- r aftern-- n,
      A wee be-- re the s-- n w-- nt d-- n,
      When Kitty wi' a braw n--
---
Elizabeth- Jane had apprehended the singer in a moment, and
---
We are looking at the wonderful new drill
---
Miss Templeman said.
---
practically it is a stupid thing--
---
is it not?
---
It will revolutionize!
---
Each grain will go straight to its intended place, and nowhere else
 whatever!"


---
Then the romance of the sower is gone for good
---
the wind shall not sow,'
---
that so the Preacher
 said; but
---
It must be so!"
---
the machines are already very common in the
 East and North of England
---
the Scriptures being somewhat limited
---
Is the machine yours?
---
I merely recommended."


---
it should be got
---
The latter felt.
---
Together they saw the
 market thicken, and.
---
The
 gigs and vans disappeared one by one.
---
there was not a vehicle in the
 street
---
The time of the riding world was over
---
the pedestrian world held
 sway.
---
Field labourers and their wives and children trooped in from the
 villages for their weekly shopping, and instead of a rattle of wheels
 and a tramp of horses
---
ruling the sound as earlier there was nothing but
 the shuffle of many feet.
---
All the implements were gone; all the farmers;
 all the moneyed class.
---
The character of the town's trading had changed
 from bulk to multiplicity and pence.


---
pounds had been
 handled earlier in the day
---
it was night and

---
the street lamps were lighted
---
though they had kept their shutters
---
they spoke more freely.


---
It is
---
I am
 respectable
---
I have tried, but in
 vain!
---
you can imagine
---
You
 do n't know."


---
it is
---
I do not-- of that kind precisely said,
" but."


---
you may feel a-- sense of disgrace-- shame-- in other ways
---
Have you ever had any such feeling?"
---
I was thinking of
---
" what happens sometimes
."


---
It must make them very unhappy afterwards."


---
It makes them anxious
---
Possibly they were destroyed; but
---
they had never been written
---
the latter was going out
---
Miss Templeman was

---
The fact was
.
---
Elizabeth- Jane was beginning
---
they could be held
---
their desire not to be
 observed
---
; beheld the indecision
 of both between their lothness to separate and; depicted their shaking of hands how they probably parted with
 frigidity in their general contour and movements, only in the smaller
 features showing the spark of passion, thus invisible to all but
 themselves.
---
This discerning silent witch had not done thinking of these
 things.


---
It was all true
---
How did you know?"


---
said Elizabeth- Jane.


---
They were intimate-- rather.
---
there was an unsuspected
 hitch in the proceedings;.
---
they were
 much apart,
---
" I should add.
---
which separated them
---
last the obstacle
 was; and
---
Now comes the point
---
that's bad!"


---
It is bad!
---
you must remember."


---
that discovered
---
some qualities in the first than thought
---
I can not answer
---
" said Elizabeth- Jane thoughtfully.
---
It is so
 difficult.
---
It wants!"


---
a Pope to settle that
---
You prefer not to perhaps?"
---
I would rather not say."


---
How do I appear to people?"
---
I wonder!"
---
I wear well,
---
times go
---
Where am I worst?"


---
I notice a little brownness there."


---
That is my worst place,.
---
I know
---
How many years more do you think?"


---
I
 shall last
---
I get hopelessly plain
---
There was something curious in the way
---
the younger had come.
---
It may be five years
---
you might calculate on ten."


---
who was very tender- hearted
---
it was.
---
it can be said.


---
it were written on the top of the church- tower hard by
---
it was no use
---
This caused.

---
does that
 mean?
---
You know
---
I could n't have helped myself
---
I had

---
if wished that is,.
---
I had any kindness at all
---
I've called
---
I am ready, as soon as custom will permit,
---
you lost by it in thinking too little of
 yourself and too much of me
---
you can fix the day or month,
 with my full consent,
---
to say that
 to give you my name in return
 for your devotion and what to say that it would be seemly:
---
you
 know more of these things than I."


---
It is full early yet
---
I suppose.
---
it is
---
you know
---
I felt directly
---
when I could not bear the idea of marrying
 again
---
it was my duty.
---
any unnecessary delay occur before putting things to rights
---
Still I
 would n't call in a hurry,."
---
you can guess
---
how this money
've come into
---
me feel
---
I did n't know such furniture
---
this could be bought in
 Casterbridge
---
can it be
---
will it
---
fifty years more of
 civilization have passed over the town.
---
It took a waggon and four horses
."


---
It looks."


---
you were living on capital
---
I am not."


---
the fact is,."


---
this makes rather awkward
---
An answer was
---
there's nobody in the world."
---
I would have wished and nobody, I am sure, who will
 become it more
---
I am greatly obliged to you for all that
---
The stint of reciprocal feeling was perceived, and

---
nobody was more quick.


---
You may be obliged or not for't.
---
I say
---
the things may not have
 the polish of what you've lately learnt to expect for the first time in
 your life
---
Though they are real, my lady Lucetta."


---
That's rather a rude way of speaking to me,
---
there there I do n't wish
.
---
I come with an honest proposal for silencing your
 Jersey enemies, and!"
---
you ought.
---
How can you speak so
---
my
 only crime was and
---
I was
---
I call innocent
 all the time they called me guilty
---
I
 suffered enough at that worrying time,!"


---
when you wrote and
---
I am a little
 independent now
---
if surely the privilege is due to me
---
it is
---
it is not by what is, in this life, but by
 what appears,; and
---
you are judged
---
I therefore think-- for your own good name's sake.
---
you ought
---
What is known in your native
 Jersey
---
may get known here."


---
How you keep on about Jersey!
---
I am English!"


---
do you say to my proposal?"


---
things be
---
I'll treat you as
 one.
---
there being no pressure of half acquaintance to drive them into
 speech
---
they were not minded for it
---
That's the way the wind blows
---
" is it
---
A yellow flood of reflected sunlight filled the room for a few instants.

---
I should n't have thought it
---
such is not for me
---
You came
---
now you are here!"


---
you wo n't have anything to say to my offer
---
it would be
 madness.
---
I wo n't be a slave to the
 past-- I'll love where I choose!"


---
it was the unforced passion of youth.
---
The pain was shown by the pair of them.
---
they were
---
as deeply concerned as if they uttered a conventional
 word of sympathy at the news, and.

---
it was
 quite natural
---
when the moon had risen in the skies
---
it had
---
Continually had happened, and.
---
what had not been

---
It chanced.
---
there was not another soul near.

---
They receded from each
 other several paces!"
---
Do you remember
---
I do
---
Do you remember?

" Yes."


---
how it all began and
---
how it ended
---
I have offered;
---
I can
---
I put it to you
---
It is true
---
They were not
 those of a conscious rival.


---
There
 was an antagonistic force in exercise
---
it was not
 innate caprice
---
they screened an ousting presence
---
that
 was
---
said kind Elizabeth- Jane,.


---
There was a knock at the door; literally, three full knocks and a little
 one at the end.


---
" That kind of knock means half- and- half-- somebody between gentle
 and simple
---
I should n't wonder
 therefore."
---
just any young fool of a lover might feel
---
They sat stiffly side by side at the darkening table, like some Tuscan
 painting of the two disciples supping at Emmaus.
---
who had
---
there were long spaces of
 taciturnity, when all exterior circumstances were subdued to the touch
 of spoons and china, the click of a heel on the pavement under the
 window, the passing of a wheelbarrow or cart, the whistling of the
 carter, the gush of water into householders' buckets at the town- pump
 opposite, the exchange of greetings among their neighbours, and the
 rattle of the yokes by which they carried off their evening supply
---
each feeling certain
---
the slice came in two.


---
I am so sorry!"
---
which were as the notes of an
 insect that lie above the compass of the human ear
---
the sense of occult rivalry in suitorship was
.
---
it added an inflaming soul.


---
I am again out of a foreman
---
said the corn- factor.
---
Are you in a
 place?"


---
do you ask?"


---
which was very moderate
---
When can you come?"


---
who pocketed
 at the street corner till
---
I
 know Jersey too, sir
---
when you used
---
Then the thing is settled.
---
you
 showed me
---
when you first tried
---
for't are sufficient
---
characters deteriorated in time of need
---
one
 thing is necessary to me, as the biggest corn- and- hay dealer in these
 parts
---
The Scotchman, must be cut out.
---
We ca n't live side by
 side
---
two that's clear and certain."


---
I've seen it all
---
I mean
---
I've capital, mind ye, and
---
I can do it."


---
I'm all that way of thinking
---
said the new foreman.
---
I sometimes think.
---
They then entered into specific details of the process by which this
 would be accomplished, and parted at a late hour.


---
Elizabeth- Jane heard by accident.
---
it was done to no purpose.

---
The season's weather seemed.
---
The time was in
 the years
---
foreign competition had revolutionized
 the trade in grain
---
A bad harvest, or the prospect of one would double the price of corn in
 a few weeks; and
---
the promise of a good yield would lower it as rapidly.

---
Prices were like the roads of the period, steep in gradient,.


---
The people too were
 not farmers, the rural multitude, saw in the god of the weather a
 more important personage than they do now.
---
Indeed the feeling of the
 peasantry in this matter was so intense as to be almost unrealizable in
 these equable days.
---
Their impulse was well- nigh.


---
which came
---
the
 Alastor of those households whose crime was
---
they watched the weather- cocks.
---
Sun elated them
---
quiet rain sobered them;

---
weeks of watery tempest stupefied them.
---
they now regard as disagreeable
---
they then beheld as maleficent.


---
It was June, and
---
the weather was very unfavourable.
---
it were the bell- board on which all the adjacent hamlets and villages
 sounded their notes
---
Casterbridge, being
 as was decidedly dull.
---
that had been rejected in the foregoing summer
---
badly- shaped rakes, shop- worn
 leggings, and time- stiffened water- tights reappeared,.


---
so many have wished
---
such
 head- strong natures often are
---
what are
 called lonely villages
---
were teeming by comparison
---
when it was raining
---
ivy and laurel resounded
 like distant musketry, and
---
such a shrouded figure on foot
 might have been perceived.
---
which dripped over the prophet's cot
---
The turnpike- road became a lane,
 the lane a cart- track, the cart- track a bridle- path, the bridle- path a
 foot- way, the foot- way overgrown.
---
The solitary walker slipped here and
 there, and.
---
formed by the brambles

which was

The cottage, comparatively a large
 one had been built of mud by the occupier's own hands, and.
---
here it was assumed.

There's nothing in' em,"
  with full assurance on the surface of their faces
---
very few of them were
 unbelievers in their secret hearts.
---
they
 did it" for a fancy.
---
they said,".


---
Just a trifle for
 Christmas," or" Candlemas," as the case might be
---
when they professed so much and

---
a door
 was inserted as in a wall.
---
the tall traveller stopped,
.
---
The window shutters were not and
---
came to the door, candle in hand.
---
The
 visitor stepped back a little from the light, and?" in significant tones.
---
Can I speak
 to' ee
---
The other's invitation to come in was

---
This will do
---
the householder had no alternative but
---
I've long heard?"
---
you can do things of a sort
---
why do you call me that?
---
it's your name.
---
Feeling you'd come;
 and."
---
I've waited for' ee
---
you might be leery from your walk
---
I laid two supper
 plates
---
Then I have not come in
 vain
---
I've done-- with consideration--.
---
they will wear the toad- bag by
 night as well as by day
---
When can I know?'


---
I've worked it out already, and
---
you can know at once."
---
The fact
 was.)
---
five farmers had already been there on the same errand from
 different parts of the country
---
the winds, the trees, and grass, the candle- flame and swallows the smell of the herbs likewise will be-- rain and tempest."


---
You are not certain, of course?"


---
one can be in a world
---
As where all's unsure.
---
Shall I sketch it out for
' ee in a scheme?"


---
I do n't altogether believe in forecasts.
---
you don't--'tis quite understood
---
You have given me a crown because you've one too many.

---
wo n't you join me at supper,?"


---
now tis waiting and all
---
hob- and- nob there would have seemed
---
The weather changed
---
which had been like tin for weeks
---
the
 sunlight, assumed the hues of
 topaz.
---
The temperament of the welkin passed from the phlegmatic to
 the sanguine
---
an excellent harvest was almost a certainty; and.


---
a
 consequence prices rushed down
---
All these transformations, lovely to the outsider, to the wrong- headed
 corn- dealer were terrible.
---
settlement could not long be postponed, and
---
Much of the corn never seen
---
it had not even been moved from the ricks in which it lay
 stacked miles away.
---
These
 things always happen
---
do n't they?
---
I know
---
it has been said
---
figures
 have touched me tight lately
---
The case is not
 so bad.
---
folk make out perhaps
---
You can wipe and!"
---
can ye
---
it had n't been for your blasted advice
---
If it might have been
 a fine day enough!
---
Why did ye let!
---
me go on,
---
hey?--when a word of doubt
 from you or anybody would have made
---
me think twice
---
you can never be
 sure of weather till' tis past."


---
My advice, was."


---
what thought best
---
the sooner you help somebody else in that way the
 better!"
---
It was the eve of harvest.
---
Prices being low
---
There were three days of excellent weather, and then--"What if that
 curst conjuror should be right after all!"
---
The fact was.
---
that no sooner had
---
, the sickles begun
---
the
 atmosphere suddenly felt
---
cress would grow in it without other
 nourishment
---
It rubbed people's cheeks.
---
when they
 walked abroad
---
There was a gusty, high, warm wind
---
isolated raindrops
 starred the window- panes at remote distances
---
; the sunlight would flap
 out like a quickly opened fan, and.


---
suddenly
 it had appeared
---
it was clear.
---
there was not
---
I wonder
---
I wonder!
---
it can
 be
---
somebody has been roasting a waxen image of me, or
---
I do n't believe in such power; and yet-- what
 if they should ha' been doing it!"
---
It was indeed hard.


---
the
 speaker should have
---
September- night shades had fallen upon Casterbridge
---
the clocks had

---
the moon had risen.
---
The streets of the town
 were curiously silent for such a comparatively early hour.
---
A sound of
 jangling horse- bells and heavy wheels passed up the street.
---
These were

---
Elizabeth- Jane to run to the windows, and
---
The neighbouring Market House and Town Hall abutted against its next
 neighbour the Church except in the lower storey, where an arched
 thoroughfare gave admittance to a large square called Bull Stake.
---
A
 stone post rose in the midst,.
---
the oxen had formerly been tied
 for baiting with dogs to make them tender before they were killed in the
 adjoining shambles
---
The thoroughfare leading to this spot was now blocked by two four- horse
 waggons and horses, one laden with hay- trusses,.
---
the leaders having
 already passed each other, and become entangled head to tail
---
The
 passage of the vehicles might have been practicable if empty; but
---
one was
---
it was impossible.


---
You must have done it a' purpose!
---
You can
 hear my horses' bells half- a- mile such a night as this!"


---
ye'd been minding your business instead of zwailing along in such
 a gawk- hammer way
---
If you would have zeed me!
---
However it appeared
---
the near hind- wheel rose against
 the churchyard wall and
---
the whole mountainous load went over, and the legs of the thill horse.


---
two of the
 four wheels rising in the air,
---
the first round was quite over
---
that was down
---
they watched the bright heap of new hay lying in the
 moon's rays
---
nobody else had seen
---
what the origin
 of the mishap; and spoke.


---
I saw it all
---
I did n't notice you,
 Miss Templeman
---
I beg your pardon notwithstanding.
---
The other's is the empty
 waggon, and
---
No I saw it, too
---
; said Elizabeth- Jane.
---
I can assure you."


---
You ca n't trust THEIR senses!"
---
you see
---
do you know?
---
that lady is
---
you talk about in such a fashion
---
Do
 you know?
---
I know nothing, sir, outside eight shillings a week."


---
you hint at
---
the door was shut.
---
While pausing the old constable came
 up.


---
nobody drives against that hay and waggon to- night,
 Stubberd
---
Just see that said the corn- merchant.
---
It must bide till the morning, for
 all hands
---
any coach or road- waggon wants

---
they must go round by the back street, and
---
's that?"


---
That's all, sir."


---
Very well then I'll be there.
---
the horses being removed
---
the moon was not bright
, and
---
there were no lamps lighted
---
it was
 obvious.
---
the nature
 of that might be at such an hour
---
The lights disappeared
---
the clock
 struck nine, and
---
That was
 certain,.
---
They went together
 by the way of a back lane westward,.


---
where they were going
---
The harvest had been so delayed by the capricious weather that whenever
 a fine day occurred all sinews were strained to save what could be saved
 of the damaged crops.
---
worked by moonlight
---
formed by Casterbridge town
---
Hence the wheat- fields abutting
 on the two sides of the square were animated
 by the gathering hands.
---
Nearly the whole town had gone into the fields.
---
The Casterbridge
 populace still retained the primitive habit of helping one another in
 time of need; and thus,--
---
the corn belonged to the farming section
 of the little community
---
inhabiting the Durnover quarter the
 remainder was no less interested in the labour of getting it home.


---
The
" stitches" or shocks rose like tents about the yellow expanse, those in
 the distance becoming lost in the moonlit hazes.


---
two others had entered at that place, and
---
them winding among the shocks
---
They were paying no regard to the
 direction of their walk
---
whose vague serpentining soon began.
---
You have my leave,."
---
you like
---
you are sure
---
will ye resist?"


---
the temptation to be one of
 those ladies with lots of admirers-- ay-- and
---
I'm afraid that what I feel will make me forget my manners!"


---
Then I hope,."
---
you'll never have any
---
you lack them only for that
 cause
---
Are you
 sure you wo n't be jealous?
---
You are
---
I love nobody else
---
I should wish."


---
did you mean?"


---
I wished
---
I should not be happy here
---
They went on towards
 the scene of activity, where the sheaves were being handed, a dozen a
 minute, upon the carts and waggons which carried them away.


---
the room was empty, and
---
rustling in the hall,
---
followed by a
 soft closing of the door
---
How can you frighten me so?
---
It
 is past ten o'clock, and
---
you have no right to surprise me here at such a
 time."


---
I do n't know.
---
I've not the right
---
I have the excuse.
---
Is
 it so necessary that I should stop to think of manners and customs?"


---
It is too late for propriety, and."


---
I called an hour ago, and.
---
you would not see me, and
---
I thought
---
you were
 in
---
when I called now
---
It is you, Lucetta, who are doing wrong.
---
It is
 not proper in' ee.
---
I have a little matter."


---
you seem
---
I do n't want
---
to hear it I do n't want!"
---
you ought
---
It came to nothing; and through you.
---
I gained with such sorrow
---
Had I found
---
you proposed
---
I might have felt.
---
I soon learnt, and.
---
you had planned it out of mere charity-- almost as an unpleasant
 duty--
---
I had nursed you, and
---
you thought

---
you must repay me
---
I did not care for you so deeply as
 before."


---
Why did you come here, then?"


---
I thought,."

"
---
I ought
---
you were
 free
---
even I did not like you so well
---
why then do n't you think so now?"


---
It was only too obvious that conscience had ruled well
 enough till new love had intervened and usurped that rule.
---
The only thing was," and
---
now my circumstances have altered,
---
so I am hardly the same
 person."


---
That's true.
---
it makes the case awkward for me.
---
I do n't want.
---
I am quite willing that every penny of your property
 shall remain to your personal use.
---
Besides that argument has nothing in
 it.
---
you are thinking of
---
you were as good
---
You can refuse me
---
you give me your promise this very night
---
I want
---
you to hear this
---
Will you, or
---
you wish it
---
If-- I must agree!"


---
You say yes?"


---
I do."


---
if wo n't it?
---
are you talking about?"
---
Then it is my mistake
---
the business is
 between me and Miss Templeman.
---
I do n't wish to
---
I have
---
I have
---
I will not
---
Elizabeth- Jane continued.
---
is this
---
is it

---
you promise
---
you have many many secrets from me!"


---
Perhaps you have some from me
---
I would not
---
I can not
 understand
---
it all be
---
To- day Dr. Chalkfield, the Mayor for
 the year, being absent the corn- merchant took the big chair,.


---
There was one case only, and
---
that seemed; and

---
where the clouds drop fatness
---
whispered Stubberd.


---
" said the other magistrate.


---
's hear
---
you've got
---
Stubberd was sworn in
---
the constable Hearing a' illegal noise I went down the street at twenty- five minutes
 past eleven P.M. on the night of the fifth instinct, Hannah Dominy
---
When
 I had--


---
" Do n't go so fast, Stubberd said the clerk.


---
the latter
 stopped and
---
Stubberd continued:"."
---
When I had

---
I saw defendant at another spot, namely, the
 gutter
---
Still careful not to outrun the clerk's penmanship Stubberd pulled up
 again
---
I object to that
---
' spot measuring twelve feet
 where is not sound testimony!"


---
The magistrates consulted, and
---
the second one said.


---
the bench was
 of opinion
---
when I approached
---
Dost hear, old turmit- head
---
I
 have floored fellows a dee sight
---
I haint
---
I object to that conversation!"
---
I was not
 capable enough to hear what I said, and."


---
what is said out of my hearing

---
There was another stoppage for consultation
---
a book was referred to, and
.
---
finally Stubberd was allowed
---
The truth was.
---
they were obliged
---
when Stubberd had rambled on
---
Come we do n't want
---
Twenty years ago or thereabout I was selling of furmity in a tent at
 Weydon Fair----"

"' Twenty years ago'--well
---
that's beginning at the beginning
---
you go back to the Creation
---
said the clerk, not without satire.


---
what was evidence and
---
what was
 not
---
They sat down and.
---
I
 was of a more respectable station in the world then; and
---
I am now,
---
I used.
---
who asked for't
---
A sailor came in and.
---
We do n't want
---
to hear your life
 and adventures said the second magistrate sharply,.
---
which followed
---
You've been asked."


---
you've anything to say bearing on
 the case
---
That bears on the case.
---
It proves, and."


---
Tis a concocted story said the clerk.
---
Tis as true as the
 light said slowly."
---
it does prove!
---
The sensation in the court was indescribably great.
---
This had brought them hither.


---
Why are there so many idlers?"
---
when the case was over
---
which seemed
---
which only served
---
anything should be called curious in
 concatenations of phenomena
---
wherein each is known
---
It was the day of the chief market-- Saturday-- and
---
Nevertheless it was known.


---
which bordered the highway in this and other directions out
 of the town
---
This end marked a mile; and
---
The spot was a vale between two gentle acclivities, and
---
the road still adhering to its Roman foundation stretched onward straight as a
 surveyor's line.
---
There was
 neither hedge nor tree in the prospect now, the road clinging to the
 stubby expanse of corn- land like a strip to an undulating garment.
---
nothing appeared
 thereon-- not so much as a speck.
---
Here the case was different.
---
I would come and
---
cattle were at once the mainstay and
 the terror of families about Casterbridge and its neighbourhood, where
 breeding was carried on with Abrahamic success.
---
The head of stock
 driven into and out of the town at this season
---
to be sold by the local
 auctioneer
---
the animals would have walked along quietly enough; but
---
the
 Casterbridge tradition was.
---
that to drive stock it was indispensable
---
hideous cries, coupled with Yahoo antics and gestures should be used,

---
large sticks flourished,
---
dogs called in, and
---
everything
 done
---
that was likely to infuriate the viciously disposed and terrify the
 mild
---
who apologized for their presence by
 saying," A bull passing down street from the sale
---
It was a large specimen of the breed, in colour
 rich dun,.
---
which flung about like a flail
---
It was not
---
they observed this dangling stick
---
till that it revealed to them.


---
They looked round for some shelter or hiding- place, and thought of the
 barn hard by.
---
they had kept their eyes on the bull
---
no sooner did they
 turn their backs.
---
This caused,.


---
whereupon the bull advanced in a deliberate charge
---
The barn stood behind a green slimy pond, and.
---
it was closed and for this opening they made
---
which had been propped open
 by a hurdle- stick,
---
The interior had been
 cleared by a recent bout of threshing except at one end, where there was
 a stack of dry clover.
---
Elizabeth- Jane took in the situation.
---
We must
 climb up there
---
they had even approached it
---
they heard, and
---
the bull scampering
 through the pond without
---
all three were imprisoned in the barn together.
---
The mistaken
 creature saw them, and.
---
they had fled
---
they had crossed over
---
By the time that follow them
 thither thus the pursuit went on,.
---
What
 might have happened.
---
had their situation continued
---
a rattling of the door distracted their adversary's
 attention, and
---
The wrench was in reality so violent that the thick neck seemed to have
 lost its stiffness and to become half- paralyzed, whilst the nose dropped
 blood.
---
The premeditated human contrivance of the nose- ring was, and
---
the creature flinched.


---
You have saved me!
---
I have returned your kindness
---
You once saved
 me."


---
How-- comes-- you.


---
it to be you
---
I came out here.
---
I have been wanting; but
---
you have been away, and
---
I could
 not.
---
Perhaps you can not talk now?"


---
Here am I!
---
the ladder to be placed
---
They had reached the top
 and.


---
I'll run back
---
said Elizabeth- Jane.
---
I do n't mind it at all,"
---
I am
 not tired as you are.
---
the others pursuing their way
---
what had occurred
---
you say
---
They are almost there by this time."


---
Elizabeth- Jane was quite sure.


---
it would be best
---
it was unwise
---
The immediate subject of their talk being exhausted; but
---
soon the two
 figures of the others were visible at the entrance to the town.
---
These phenomena however seemed.
---
When will everything be sent up
---
I am afraid not before eight, sir
---
You see."


---
we was n't aware
 till this morning
---
you were going, or
---
we could have been
 forwarder
---
Eight o'clock
 will do well enough.
---
it be not later
---
Now do n't ye be standing here
, or
---
it will be twelve
---
, talking I doubt."
---
I have been
 very, very anxious to see you these two or three days"!
---
ever
 I saw you last
---
I have thought over the way I got your promise
 that night.
---
You said to me,'.'
---
That
 cut me deep.
---
I felt.
---
there was some truth in it
---
I do n't want; and
---
nothing
 else could
---
it is but too plain
---
Therefore I agree to an indefinite
 engagement--."


---
can I do nothing of a different kind?"
---
I am
 full of gratitude to you
---
you have saved my life.
---
your care of me is
 like coals of fire on my head!
---
I am a monied person now.
---
Surely I can do
 something in return for your goodness-- something practical?"


---
There
 is one thing you might do, Lucetta
---
Then is it
---
I must tell you a secret to ask it.--You may have heard that I have
 been unlucky this year?
---
I did--; and
---
I have never done before
---
I lost.
---
That's
---
you would wish me?"


---
you can do
---
what is this and
---
it would save me.
---
I shall suffer
---
you would let
---
it be

---
you are
---
we are
---
me speak to' ee
---
we were on such terms
---
Not a soul in the town need know.
---
how you've helped me
---
you
 wish
---
Since to be of use there's your way."


---
It being now
---
the people called the" pinking in" of the day,
---
it were anything else
---
it is such a little thing!"
---
you have offered
---
you have
---
It is not.


---
I is
---
I absolutely ca n't said,
 with rising distress
---
You are provoking!"
---
It is enough to make me force you to
 carry out at once what you have promised."


---
I can not!
---
When I have only within these few minutes
---
I must tell you----.
---
's hear?
---
you mean
---
We were
.
---
There were reasons against our doing it
 here.
---
It was like this
---
I thought
-- and!
---
that grieved me
---
when I
 had promised you
---
then I learnt of the rumour that you had--!
---
How could I keep my promise after
 hearing that?
---
I could not risk myself in your hands
---
it would have been
.
---
I knew.
---
you will
 not do so now, will you, Michael?
---
it is too late to separate us."


---
The notes of St. Peter's bells in full peal had been wafted to them
, and
---
now the genial thumping of the town band throbbed down the street.


---
they are making
---
Then this racket is on account of it
---
" I suppose?
---
I think....
---
May I leave
 you now?
---
I have saved this afternoon
---
You promised me!"


---
it was under compulsion, and
---
I did not know all your
 past----"

"
---
now I've a mind!
---
you deserve
---
how you courted me
---
your precious happiness is

---
You do n't deserve pity!
---
You did; but you do n't now."


---
I'll help you."


---
Do n't stay with me longer I
 shall say something worse.
---
the band came round
 the corner,
---
The work
 was not heavy, but.


---
it had been much hindered on account of the frequent
 pauses necessitated by exclamations of surprise at the event,
---
had been detained by important customers,.
---
what had happened
---
the sense come

---
which could not have intensified
---
There is one thing I have not done; and
---
yet it is important
---
you have not
---
I gave her a lift from
 the barn homewards; but
---
I thought

---
I'll find out
---
you do n't mind with me just the same as
 before?
---
indeed I do n't answered with, perhaps, a faint
 awkwardness.
---
I wonder?"


---
It is I who have
 come to your house, not you to mine."


---
I'll run and
---
I did not come down to you, Miss Templeman
---
I was

---
you had quite recovered from your fright
---
I found
.
---
you had a visitor
---
What are the bells ringing for I wonder?
---
the
 band too is playing.
---
Somebody must be married; or else
---
they are
."


---
you are
---
what's going on, or
---
people are

---
then you would n't be obliged.
---
now I have something to tell you."


---
Elizabeth- Jane said and.


---
I must go rather a long way back
---
You remember?"
---
that trying case
 of conscience
---
I told you of some time ago-- about the first lover and the
 second lover
---
I remember the story of YOUR FRIEND
---
I've just been
 construing
---
you said?"


---
You will never breathe this, will you,
 Elizabeth- Jane?
---
you say not
---
Certainly not, if.

 Then I will tell you.
---
the case is more complicated-- worse, in
 fact--
---
it seemed in my story
---
I and the first man were thrown
 together in a strange way, and.
---
we ought
---
the
 world had talked of us
---
we parted.
---
Now we'll complete our purposes
---
Have you not lately renewed your promise?
---
said the younger with quiet
 surmise.
---
it was.
---
I think."


---
when any one gets
---
so unfortunately you have done
---
I
 should be afraid to marry
---
it was not
 till after my renewed promise."


---
I knew it
---
Then there is only one course left to honesty.
---
I am certain
---
I have guessed very
 well.
---
Any suspicion of impropriety was to Elizabeth- Jane like a red rag to
 a bull.
---
You ought!
---
I do n't admit that!"
---
Admit it or not it is true!"


---
When did you do it
---
Why did you
 not tell me, instead of teasing me like this?
---
it seems,
---
it is true.
---
But I am sure, with your beauty and wealth and
 accomplishments.
---
we shall be happy together now!"


---
I have married
---
what might
---
"---- cried Elizabeth- Jane, in Nathan tones


---
The bells are ringing on that account
---
a more suitable house is ready for
 us
---
I want just as before
---
you to stay with me
---
me think of it alone
---
You shall.
---
I am sure we shall be happy together."


---
It was still early in the evening.
---
which were pursued unremittingly
---
that had taken place
---
the marriage was known throughout
 Casterbridge
---
life were lost sight of in the dramatic glare of the original act.
---
the act having lain as dead and buried ever since
---
the
 interspace of years was unperceived; and
---
Small had been in itself
---
as the police- court incident it formed the
 edge or.
---
It was strange
---
which is the soul of commerce in grain
---
Elizabeth- Jane was passing the King's Arms,.
---
people bustling
 in and out more than usual where there was no market
---
debtor and creditors had assembled
---
The room in which was a front
 one, and
---
the creditors were leaving.
---
the black hair and
 whiskers were the same as ever, but
---
a film of ash was over the rest.


---
" Gentlemen said," over and above the assets that we've been talking
 about, and.
---
that appear on the balance- sheet
---
there be these
---
It all
 belongs to ye, as much as everything else I've got, and
---
I do n't wish
---
not I. Saying this
---
The latter
 to remove the hair- guard made and
.
---
There now you have
---
I've got in the world
---
I wish for your sakes' twas more."


---
We do n't want that.'
---
do you say, neighbours
---
" Ay, sure we do n't wish it at all
---
the rest responded
 unanimously.

"
---
said the senior Commissioner,,".
---
the
 case is a desperate one
---
though I am bound
---
I have never met a
 debtor who behaved more fairly
---
I've proved the balance- sheet to be as
 honestly made out as it could possibly be
---
we have had no trouble
---
there
 have been no evasions and no concealments.
---
which
 led to this unhappy situation
---
The rashness of dealing is obvious enough; but."


---
I can see

---
as far as every attempt has been made
---
them perceive
---
A general murmur of agreement
 followed the Commissioner's words, and
---
the meeting dispersed.
---
When they
 were gone
---
Why the devil did n't take

---
it?--I do n't want!"
---
what do n't belong to me
---
the tradesman offered
---
When everything was ticketed
---
the auctions
 were in progress
---
that there was quite a sympathetic reaction in the town,
.
---
which till then had done nothing but
---
Now
 that they could see
---
they wondered and
.


---
nobody else did
---
necessity had no choice
---
which seemed old enough
 to have been planted by the friars
---
Trees still stood around, and
---
the back
 hatch of the original mill yet formed a cascade which had raised its
 terrific roar for centuries.
---
The cottage itself was built of old
 stones from the long dismantled Priory
---
scraps of tracery, moulded
 window- jambs, and arch- labels, being mixed in with the rubble of the
 walls.


---
dismissed by turns
---
it was with amazement.
---
A smear of decisive lead- coloured paint had been laid on,.
---
its letters dimly loomed through like
 ships in a fog
---
" Yaas, Miss Henchet said,"
---
We work harder, but
---
we
 bain't made afeard now.
---
It was fear made my few poor hairs so thin!
---
The intelligence was in a general sense true; and
---
when the new tenant had
 possession
---
Thenceforward the full sacks, looped with the shining chain,
 went
---
hairy arms were thrust
 out from the different door- ways, and
---
, was hauled in
---
scurrying up and down under the cat- head the grain trusses
 of hay were tossed anew in and out of the barns, and
---
the wimbles
 creaked;.





---
the scales and steel- yards began
---
where
 guess- work had formerly been the rule
---
Two bridges stood near the lower part of Casterbridge town.
---
first,
 of weather- stained brick was immediately at the end of High Street,

---
where a diverging branch from that thoroughfare ran round to the
 low- lying Durnover lanes
---
The, so the precincts of the bridge formed
 the merging point of respectability and indigence.
---
The second bridge, of
 stone, was further out on the highway-- in fact, fairly in the meadows,
 though still within the town boundary.


---
These bridges had speaking countenances.
---
Every projection in was worn down to obtuseness, partly by weather, more by friction from
 generations of loungers.
---
whose toes and heels had from year to year

---
they had stood there

---
even the flat faces were worn into hollows by the same
 mixed mechanism.
---
The masonry of the top was clamped with iron at each
 joint
---
this pair of bridges gravitated all the failures of the town;
 those who had failed in business, in love, in sobriety, in crime.
---
Why
 the unhappy hereabout usually chose the bridges for their meditations in
 preference to a railing, a gate, or a stile,
---
There was a marked difference of quality between the personages who
 haunted the near bridge of brick and the personages who haunted the far
 one of stone.
---
Those of lowest character preferred the former adjoining
 the town did not mind the glare of the public eye.
---
They had been
 of comparatively no account during their successes; and
---
they
 might feel dispirited
---
though they had no particular sense of shame in their
 ruin.
---
Their hands were mostly kept in their pockets
---
they wore, but.
---
that required a great deal
 of lacing
---
they spat, and
---
the iron had entered into
 their souls
---
they said.
---
they were down on their luck
---
who would pause on the remoter bridge
---
The miserables were of a politer
 stamp.
---
They included bankrupts, hypochondriacs, persons who were what is
 called" out of a situation" from fault or lucklessness, the inefficient
 of the professional class-- shabby- genteel men, who did not know how to
 get rid of the weary time between breakfast and dinner, and the yet more
 weary time between dinner and dark.
---
The eye of this species were
---
one in
 straits on the townward bridge did not mind
---
whenever a stranger
 approached
---
every finned
 thing had been poached out of the river years before
---
thus they would muse
---
their grief were the grief of
 oppression
---
There and if they would wish themselves kings
---
their grief were
 poverty
---
sin they would wish
---
they were
 saints or angels
---
;; if, wish themselves millionaires if, despised love they were some much- courted
 Adonis of county fame.
---
Some had been known and
---
eventually they had allowed their
 poor carcases;
---
they were discovered the next
 morning out of reach of their troubles, either here or in the deep pool
 called Blackwater, a little higher up the river.


---
the corner was

---
whose observation and opinion despised to the point of indifference.


---
is that?"


---
somebody was sure to live there, and
---
you could n't
---
It was quite true
---
it was doing him no harm
---
who
 had already taken the yards and stores
---
you heard of that fellow who bought all the best
 furniture at your sale?
---
It has never been moved out of the house,."


---
the bridge seemed.


---
The low land grew blacker, and the sky a deeper grey, When the landscape
 looked like a picture blotted in with ink.
---
another traveller approached
 the great stone bridge
---
the gig stopped."
---
I have heard, Mr. Henchard?
---
you think of emigrating
---
Is
 it true?
---
I have a real reason for asking."


---
it is true
---
I am going a few years ago,.'
---
where you were going to
---
when I
 prevented you and
---
you to bide here
---
Tis turn and turn about, is n't
 it!
---
Do ye mind?
---
how we stood like this in the Chalk Walk
---
when I persuaded
' ee
---
You then stood without a chattel to your name, and
---
I was
 the master of the house in Corn Street.
---
now I stand without a stick
 or a rag, and
---
the master of that house is you."


---
that's so!
---
It's the way o' the warrld
---
I'm.
---
's the odds after all!"


---
it's no taking up your time
---
just
 I listened to you
---
I can do nothing else, man!"
---
I have
---
The little
 money will just keep body and soul together for a few weeks, and
 no more.
---
I have not felt inclined to go back to journey- work yet; but."


---
I
 ca n't stay, and
---
my best chance is elsewhere
---
I propose
---
what is this--.
---
ye will listen
---
We can spare some rooms very well--."


---
there's an opening for ye
---
Probably the picture was too striking to
 be received with equanimity.
---
we should
 quarrel
---
You should hae a part to yourself
---
nobody to
 interfere wi' you
---
It will be a deal healthier than down there by the
 river where you live now."


---
You do n't know
---
you ask
---
However I can do no less than thank' ee."


---
They walked into the town together side by side,."
---
they had done
---
Will you come in
 and?"
---
I had nearly forgot.
---
I bought a good deal of your
 furniture.


---
So I have heard."


---
it was; but
---
I wanted it so very much for myself
---
I wish.
---
ye
 to pick out all that you care to have-- such things
---
may be endeared to
 ye by associations, or
---
it will not be depriving me."


---
we can do with less very
 well, and
---
I will have plenty of opportunities of getting more
---
What-- give it to me for nothing
---
you paid the
 creditors for it!"


---
maybe it's worth more to you."


---
it is to me
---
I sometimes think!
---
I've wronged' ee
---
Meanwhile Elizabeth- Jane packed away in a
 box,.


---
it was hardly in human
 nature.


---
when the door slammed
---
I do n't
 like' ee!"


---
I do n't like
---
However the ice was broken, and
---
The effect was a
 rapid recovery.
---
now things seemed
.
---
honest work was
 not a thing to be ashamed of
---
it was undesirable
---
these arrangements worked well, before bringing it away
---
it being the custom to truss
 in the respective stack- yards,
---
the hay bought
 at the different farms about the neighbourhood;.
---
When this was all done,
 and
---
I have worked as a journeyman before now, ha'n't I?
---
why should n't I do it again?"
---
it was.


---
that floats en
 upward
---
how cust odd it is!
---
Why d'ye say only a dozen days
---
I shall be released from my oath."


---
it will be
 twenty- one years
---
I swore it,
---
I mean
---
who was passing
 by
---
Elizabeth- Jane jumped up,.





---
none less established.
---
The rear was usually brought up by the choir, with their
 bass- viols, fiddles, and flutes under their arms.


---
The great point was
.
---
This
 scrupulosity was
---
so well understood by the landlord.
---
the whole
 company was served in cups of that measure
---
the landlord possessed
 altogether
---
Forty
 at least might have been seen at these times in the large room,.
---
Outside and above
 the forty cups came a circle of forty smoke- jets from forty clay pipes;
 outside the pipes the countenances of the forty church- goers,.


---
supported
 at the back by a circle of forty chairs
---
The conversation was not the conversation of week- days, but a thing
 altogether finer in point and higher in tone.
---
They invariably
 discussed the sermon,.
---
which had no relation to their own lives
---
the thing criticized
---
The bass- viol player and usually spoke with more authority than the rest on account of their
 official connection with the preacher.


---
the vow of twenty- one years had lapsed
---
the era of
 recklessness begun anew
---
they took their places and
---
that's true
---
I've been down in spirit for weeks
---
some of
 ye know the cause.
---
I am better now, but not quite serene.
---
I want; and
---
you
 fellows of the choir to strike up a tune
---
I am in hopes of getting altogether out of my minor
 key."


---
said the first fiddle.
---
We've let back our strings,

---
that's true, but.
---
we can soon pull'em up again
---
Sound A, neighbours, and
 give the man a stave."


---
I do n't care a curse
---
the words be
---
it may be
---
we can do that, and not a man among us that
 have sat in the gallery less than twenty year
---
" Well-- heh, heh-- said the leader of the
 band.
---
we raise the Fourth Psa'am
---
improved by thee
---
old Wiltshire is the only tune worth
 singing-- the psalm- tune that would make my blood ebb and flow like the
 sea when I was a steady chap.
---
I'll find some words to fit en."
---
their sermon having been a longer
 one.
---
the lower parish was
---
Where none can give relief
---
The fruit of all borne away.

        
---
None shall be found.

        
---
The least assistance lend
---
I know the Psa'am
---
I know
---
I
 would lief not sing it
---
Twasn't made for singing.
---
We chose it once
, but

---
when the gipsy stole the pa'son's mare,
---
pa'son were quite upset.
---
Whatever I ca n't
 fathom!
---
improved
 by me
---
Od seize your sauce

"' I tell ye, and!"

you shall
---
Not a single one
 of all the droning crew of ye goes out of this room till that Psalm!"
---
you do n't wish
---
your cust pates broke
---
don't'ee take on so!--As
---
tis the Sabbath- day, and' tis
 Servant David's words and not ours perhaps we do n't mind for once,
 hey
---
said one of the terrified choir, looking round upon the rest.
---
So
 the instruments were tuned and
---
the comminatory verses sung.


---
Do n't you blame David
---
I could afford it
---
I would n't keep a church
 choir at my own expense
---
the bitter thing is
---
when I was rich
---
I did n't need
, and
---
I could have
---
now I be poor
---
I ca n't have!"


---
I need
---
they paused
---
it being their custom to take, like others, a short walk out on the
 highway and back, between church and tea- time
---
The players and singers turned their heads and.
---
Heaven
 forbid!
---
said the bass- player.


---
I'd known
---
nothing should have drawn out of my
 wynd- pipe the breath for that Psalm,
---
said the first singer.
---
thought I,,
---
it was made

---
as long ago perhaps there is n't much in it
---
so I'll oblige a neighbour
---
" But, so there's nothing to be said against the tune."


---
you've sung it
---
yet I do n't."
---
it were a twig
---
It was at this time.

---
that Elizabeth- Jane having heard entered the room with a pale and
---
The choir and the rest of the company moved off, in accordance with
 their half- pint regulation.
---
together they went on.
---
I have kept my oath
 for twenty- one years; and
---
now I can drink with a good conscience....
---
If I am a fearful practical joker when I choose!
---
if I wo n't
 answer for my deeds!"


---
will you do?
---
they went on.
---
May I come in?
---
Heaven fasting
---
I'll come and"
 
---
you will allow me
---
Then the green door opened, and.
---
it being obvious
---
that might
 seem like triumphing over a fallen rivel
---
the rest had done,
---
I beg your pardon, ma'am
---
I said good afternoon,.


---
I
 am glad to see you, ma'am."
---
we humble workmen here feel it a great honour that a
 lady should look in and take an interest in us
---
the sarcasm was too bitter, too
 unendurable.

"
---
Can you tell me the time, ma'am?"
---
we are released from work
---
we of the lower classes know nothing of the gay leisure that
 such as you enjoy!"


---
The result of this casual rencounter was.

"
---
as will you kindly undertake
---
you used to- day
---
I walk through the yard at
 any time
---
I bear you no ill- will, and but.
---
I have

---
" Poor fool!" said."
---
I were

---
The gulf between them was growing wider
 every day.
---
it was impossible.
---
Each floor had a door opening into the air under a
 cat- head, from which a chain dangled for hoisting the sacks.


---
the upper
 door was open, and
---
it would have been possible, by a comparatively light
 touch,, and.


---
they turned
---
the movement was an idle eccentricity, and no more
---
It was not yet light
---
a dense fog prevailed, and
---
the town was
 as silent as it was dark, except that from the rectangular avenues which
 framed in the borough there came a chorus of tiny rappings, caused by
 the fall of water- drops condensed on the boughs
---
; now it was wafted from
 the West Walk, now from the South Walk; and then from both quarters
 simultaneously.
---
are ye up so airly
---
I am anxious to mention something
---
may it be?

---
It's."


---
very kind of I'm sure
---
I sometimes fear
---
we are the best of friends?"


---
we are quite friendly?"


---
to do something that would injure you----."
---
Thus they parted, and
---
journeymen now being in
 the street going to the harness- makers for articles left to

---
farm- horses going to the shoeing- smiths, and
---
the sons of
 labour showing themselves generally on the move
---
nothing had occurred
---
I want it, but
---
I have told the Council."


---
I would be fifty
 pounds
---
they would make up the other fifty among them
---
so I've heard; and
---
there's nothing to say against it for that
 matter
---
others see.
---
you do n't
---
you should know it
---
Is that so
---
is that so?"
---
God only knows
---
said Joyce,.
---
It shows."


---
How can
 I forget?
---
when I came here
---
I've a day's work to offer
---
I can think more about
 it
---
damp having
 been thrown over it by these and other voices in the air
---
The then occupier of the shop was in it
---
the intentions of the Council had been changed
---
the tea- kettle was singing on the
 high hob of the semi- egg- shaped grate.
---
the blinds are

---
See-- not drawn down, and
---
the people can look in-- what a scandal!"


---
When the candles were lighted
---
the curtains drawn, and
---
the twain sat at
 tea
---
Who has called?
---
Well-- nothing worth talking of responded sadly.

"
---
You will get through it
---
Scotchmen are always
 lucky."


---
I know many who have not been so!
---
Archibald Leith was murdered!
---
they fell into bad courses, and!"


---
I was only speaking in a general sense, of course!

---
You are always so literal.
---
when we have finished tea
---
I couldna sing to- night!
---
I would
---
I would understand; but
---
why there should be
 a wee bit of envy
---
It is more like old- fashioned
 rivalry in love than just a bit of rivalry in trade."


---
I give him employment
---
I cannet refuse it.
---
have you heard-- O Donald, dearest?
---
it is not so serious as ye fancy
---
I wish
---
you would do
---
we have talked of,"
---
We have plenty of
 money, and"


---
why should we stay?
---
they talked
 thereon.
---
a visitor was announced
---
Their neighbour Alderman Vatt came
 in.


---
You've heard
---
I suppose of poor Doctor Chalkfield's death?
---
Yes-- died
 this afternoon at five said Mr. Vatt.
---
Chalkfield was the Councilman who
 had succeeded to the Mayoralty in the preceding November.


---
Mr. Vatt continued:"
---
we
 know, and
---
we must take it all.
---
it is
---
Now I have called.
---
I should nominate, and
---
there should be
 no particular opposition,
---
there are folk.


---
whose turn is before mine; and!"
---
I'm over young, and

---
I do n't speak for myself only,
---
several have named it.
---
You
 wo n't refuse?"


---
We thought of going away,".


---
It was only a fancy
---
I wouldna refuse."


---
it is the
 wish of a respectable majority in the Council
---
how it's ourselves
---
are ruled by the Powers above us
---
We plan this, but
---
we do that.
---
they
 want, and
---
I will stay
---
It was in the bustle of the
 market,.


---
when no one could readily notice their discourse
---
I asked you months
 ago--
---
you may
 have
---
you have destroyed them
---
You must see."


---
how desirable it
 is
---
the time at Jersey should be blotted out, for the good of all
 parties
---
the woman!--I packed up every scrap of your handwriting-- but
---
you never appeared
---
what became of the parcel then?
---
The letters might have been amongst them.


---
Had that been
 opened?


---
which followed
---
this was a great ringing of
 bells in Casterbridge, and
---
the combined brass, wood, catgut, and played round the town with more prodigality of percussion- notes
 than ever.
---
I-- and the
 fair Lucetta was
---
which had an interest
 far beyond the ordinary)
---
The bell- ringing and the band- playing, loud as
 Tamerlane's trumpet goaded the downfallen Henchard indescribably.


---
this election had established
---
I was going
---
If so it is there now
---
I have never opened the safe at
 all as yet
---
" I keep ma papers at the bank,."


---
It was not of much consequence
---
I'll call
 for it this evening,?"


---
you do n't mind
---
It was quite late.
---
the movements of the doors were revivals of dead
 days.


---
Never mind said Henchard drily.
---
The fact is....
---
they are letters
 mostly
---
here they be.
---
ever I should see'em again!
---
I
 hope?"


---
You do n't
 forget,?

---
These letters are, in fact,.
---
it is all over now."


---
they
 might otherwise have done
---
there is practically no future.
---
who feels it impossible
---
A creature
 too unconventionally devoted to you-- that such am I. quite acquit you of any
 intention to wrong me, yet
---
you are the door through which wrong has come
 to me.
---
how far does it
 go?
---
Thus I sit here,!'
---
forsaken by my few acquaintance, and
---
forsaken by
 you
---
That's
---
when what had happened
---
acres of words like
 that was."


---
I could not cure
---
the
 fact was;
---
I do n't give
---
you may ask that
---
when I came forward
---
it would be sailing too near the wind
---
The young lady must have had a heart that bore transplanting very
 readily!"


---
the signature were indeed coming with the rest
---
The truth was.

---
it should be
---
that would call
 at that comparatively late hour
---
somebody was admitted there, and
---
presently
 the indistinct murmur of a person became audible
---
still
 the reading and conversation went on.
---
This was very singular.
---
some extraordinary crime had been committed,
 and
---
the visitor whoever was reading an account of it
 from a special edition of the Casterbridge Chronicle
---
The dining- room door was ajar, and
.
---
what amazed
---
the crackling of paper denoted
---
what was
 intended for your eye alone
---
I make it an example
 of all womankind, and not a scandal to one."


---
I were you
---
I would destroy them
---
it were known
---
I shall not destroy them
---
it had once seemed
---
The door slammed
---
who had just been

---
that was irksome
---
I could do no less."


---
This was sufficient.
---
, we attribute to an enemy a power
 of consistent action which we never find in ourselves or in our friends;
 and.


---
abortive efforts from want of heart are as possible to
 revenge as to generosity
---
It seemed.
---
The very thought of it crushes me!
---
you could see me
---
If you would relent.
---
You do not know
.
---
how anxiety has told upon me lately
---
I will be at the Ring at the time
 you leave work--.
---
just the sun goes down
---
I
 can not rest, and."


---
I have seen
---
you face to face
---
you will carry this horse- play no further
---
ever tears and
 pleadings have served the weak
---
them do so now
---
pretty slightly worn features the aspect of a
 countenance ageing prematurely from extreme sorrow
---
The interior was shadowy,
 and emphatic of the absence of every living thing.


---
could any one else have known.
---
The truth was.
---
half gained
---
Of course I'm glad to come if you want me."


---
I am sorry to see' ee looking so ill
---
How can you be sorry
---
when you
 deliberately cause it
---
Is it anything I have done that has
 pulled you down like that?"


---
It is all your doing
---
I have no other grief.
---
My happiness
 would be secure enough but for your threats.
---
You might think!
---
you have done enough
---
When I came here

---
now I am rapidly becoming an old one.
---
do you want?
---
me to do
---
I am sure I shall be
 very willing.
---
My reading of those letters was only a sort of practical
 joke, and
---
I revealed nothing."

" To give me back the letters and any papers you may have that breathe of
 matrimony or worse."


---
Every scrap shall be yours....
---
I hope so
---
you shall have the
 letters without fail.
---
your secret shall be kept.
---
I swear it."


---
How good you are!--how
---
shall I get them?"


---
I can keep my word."





---
It is a thing I know nothing about
---
you can testify to my trustworthiness better than anybody, ma'am,"
 
---
I was in Jersey several years, and."

"
---
I knew nothing of you."


---
I think, ma'am,
---
a word or two from you would secure for me
---
I
 covet very much
---
the wood laid across them for heating the morning kettle.

---
I wish
---
you would do me a service, Jopp,
 now-- to- night,,
---
I mean
---
you can
---
I should take it myself, of course, but
---
I do n't wish."


---
how have ye got on to- day?
---
Any prospect of an
 opening? am afraid not
---
There never will be in Casterbridge
---
You must roam further afield."
---
it
 had formed itself into a head like a red- hot cauliflower
---
What could be inside it?
---
curiosity to learn
---
the efficacy of such a
 fastening depended on this
---
the bundle consisted of letters
---
which stood at the end of High Street
---
We be just going down Mixen Lane way
---
, to look into Peter's Finger afore
 creeping to bed said Mrs. Cuxsom.
---
There's a fiddle and.
---
tambourine
 going on there
---
what's all the world--."


---
the upper part of Durnover was mainly composed of a curious
 congeries of barns and farm- steads
---
Though there was a less picturesque side to
 the parish.
---
This was.


---
Mixen Lane, now in great part pulled down
---
Mixen Lane was the Adullam of all the surrounding villages.
---
It was the
 hiding- place of those who were in distress, and in debt, and trouble
 of every kind.
---
who combined with their farming,
---
Farm- labourers and other peasants, a little
 poaching and a little brawling and bibbing with
 their poaching found themselves sooner or later in Mixen Lane.
---
The lane and its surrounding thicket of thatched cottages stretched out
 like a spit into the moist and misty lowland.
---
that was sad
---
Much much
 was low
---
that were baneful
---
some things could be seen in
 Mixen Lane.
---
Vice ran freely in and out certain of the doors in the
 neighbourhood
---
recklessness dwelt under the roof with the crooked
 chimney; shame in some bow- windows; theft( in times of privation) in the
 thatched and mud- walled houses by the sallows.
---
Even slaughter had not
 been altogether unknown here.
---
gone by
---
this mildewed leaf in the sturdy and flourishing Casterbridge plant
 lay close to the open country; not a hundred yards from a row of
 noble elms, and commanding a view across the moor of airy uplands and
 corn- fields, and mansions of the great.
---
A brook divided the moor from
 the tenements, and
---
there was no way across it-- no way
 to the houses but round about by the road.
---
there was
---
But under every householder's
 stairs kept a mysterious plank nine inches wide which plank
 was a secret bridge.


---
you came in from business
 after dark-- and
---
this was the business time here--
---
If, as one of those refugee householders, you stealthily crossed
 the moor,.
---
you belonged
---
A shape thereupon made its
 appearance on the other side
---
bearing the bridge on end against the sky it was lowered
---
you crossed, and
---
a hand helped,
 together with the pheasants and hares.

---
you to land yourself
---
You sold them slily the next morning, and.
---
you stood

---
You disappeared for a time
---
then you were
.


---
Walking along the lane at dusk was struck by two or three
 peculiar features therein.
---
One was
---
an intermittent rumbling from the
 back premises of the inn half- way up this meant a skittle alley.

---
Another was the extensive prevalence of whistling in the various
 domiciles-- a piped note of some kind coming from nearly every open door.

---
A white apron is a suspicious vesture in
 situations where spotlessness is difficult
---
the white apron expressed
---
that was bad needy respectability
---
there was due to the iron hand of necessity, and to that alone.
---
whose roof- trees had fallen for
 some reason or other,--
---
that had
 been their home for generations
---
Families
 from decayed villages-- families of that once bulky, but now
 nearly extinct, section of village society called" liviers," or
 lifeholders-- copyholders and others, compelling them to quit the rural spot came here,.


---
they chose
---
The inn called Peter's Finger
---
was the church of Mixen Lane.


---
It was, and.
---
such places should be
---
the inn was so respectable as to be
 puzzling.
---
The front door was kept, and
---
the step was so clean that
 evidently but few persons entered over its sanded surface.
---
Half- way up the alley was a narrow door, shiny and
 paintless from the rub of infinite hands and shoulders.
---
This was the
 actual entrance to the inn.


---
A pedestrian would be seen; and

---
the gazer to blink like
 Ashton at the disappearance of Ravenswood
---
That abstracted.


---
The company at the Three Mariners were persons of quality in comparison
 with the company which gathered here
---
it must be admitted.
---
the lowest fringe of the Mariner's party touched the crest of Peter's at
 points
---
Waifs and strays of all sorts loitered about here.
---
they sat down
---
The settles on
 which were thin and tall
---
their tops being guyed by pieces
 of twine to hooks in the ceiling
---
when the guests grew boisterous

---
, the settles would rock and.
---
The
 thunder of bowls echoed from the backyard hung behind the
 blower of the chimney; and
---
squires
 had persecuted without a cause
---
ex- poachers and ex- gamekeepers, whom sat-- men who in past
 times had met in fights under the moon, till lapse of sentences on the
 one part, and loss of favour and expulsion from service on the other,
.


---
where they sat
---
how you could jerk a trout ashore with a bramble, and
---
a deposed keeper was saying.
---
I
 caught' ee once,
---
you can mind
---
I can.
---
the worst larry for me was that pheasant business
 at Yalbury Wood.
---
there's
---
How was that
---
Why Joe closed wi' me, and
---
it being dark under the trees
---
which was uppermost
---
Where beest thee, Joe, under or top screeched.' O-- under, by
 Gad!'
---
we'd roll over again
---
I was
!
---
when we got up in hall
---
And that when' twas not your bird at all, Joe' twas
 Squire Brown's bird that's
---
we'd picked off
---
It did hurt my feelings!...
---
I might have had' ee days afore that
---
said the keeper.
---
I was within
 a few yards of' ee dozens of times, with a sight more of birds than that
 poor one.
---
the world gets wind of
---
who lately settled in this purlieu
---
It is the passion of
 love.
---
that stands high in this town
---
I'd like!
---
I've got here
---
's hear'em, good soul
---
then let said Mother Cuxsom.

---
do ye mind, Richard
---
what fools
---
we used?
---
when we were
 younger
---
These passages soon began,.

"
---
the
 epistles being allusive only did not make it altogether plain
---
Tis a humbling thing
 for us, one of the same sex could do it.
---
I say, what a good foundation for a skimmity- ride
---
True said Mrs. Cuxsom,.
---
ever I knowed
---
it ought.
---
The last
 one seen in Casterbridge must have been ten years ago, if a day."


---
there was a shrill whistle, and
---
Tis Jim coming in
---
Would ye go and?"


---
which ended
 abruptly at the edge of the stream
---
was the open moor, from which a clammy breeze smote upon their faces
 as they advanced.
---
that had lain in readiness one
 of them
---
however they had entered the house a cry of" Ahoy" from the moor.


---
The cry was repeated.
---
They pushed the lantern into an outhouse, and.


---
Ahoy is this the way to Casterbridge?"
---
said some one from the other
 side.


---
Not said Charl.
---
There's a river afore' ee."


---
I do n't care--"
---
I've
 had travelling enough for to- day."


---
Stop a minute, then said Charl,.

---
You should have kept along the turnpike road, friend, and."


---
I should--.
---
I see now
---
I saw a light here, and."


---
that's an outlying house,
---
The plank was now lowered; and
---
the stranger's form shaped itself
 from the darkness.
---
is
 this?
---
when they reached the door
---
perhaps it will suit me.
---
This was barred, and.


---
the landlady was

---
do they mean by a' skimmity- ride'?
---
I do n't encourage it.

"
---
Still are they going?
---
It is a good sight to see
---
I
 suppose?"


---
it costs money."


---
I remember hearing of some such thing.
---
Now I shall be in
 Casterbridge, and.
---
two or three weeks to come
---
Here good folks I should like, and
---
you are talking of
---
I do n't mind
---
There were more where that one came from
---
" said Charl.

---
when the
 sovereign had been taken up and
---
we ought."


---
we had him here
---
This is a respectable house
---
I'll have but."


---
nothing done
---
what's honourable
---
now we'll consider, and
---
the business begun
---
We will!
---
A good laugh warms my heart more than a cordial,
 and
---
that's the truth on't."


---
it being now somewhat late
---
who, poor soul! was inclined
---
hers had been rather the laxity of inadvertence
 than of intention
---
Such was the state of things when the current affairs of Casterbridge
 were interrupted by an event of such magnitude that its influence
 reached to the lowest social stratum there, stirring the depths of its
 society simultaneously with the preparations for the skimmington.
---
It
 was one of those excitements which, when they move a country town, leave
 permanent mark upon its chronicles, as a warm summer permanently marks
 the ring in the tree- trunk corresponding to its date.


---
which wished thus
---
Royalty had not been seen in Casterbridge since the days of the third
 King George, and then only by candlelight for a few minutes, when that
 monarch, on a night- journey, had stopped to change horses at the
 King's Arms.
---
The inhabitants therefore decided.
---
Half- an- hour's pause was not long but
---
it is true;
---
much might be done in it by a judicious grouping of
 incidents, above all,.


---
the weather were fine
---
who was handy at
 ornamental lettering
---
The Council had met on
 the Tuesday before the appointed day,.
---
they were sitting
---
While the door of the Council Chamber
 standing open
---
, they heard.
---
a heavy footstep coming up the stairs
---
It
 advanced along the passage, and
---
I have a feeling
---
I should like
---
I suppose?"


---
I could walk with the rest
---
Embarrassed glances were exchanged by the Council and Grower
---
who sat in the large
 chair,
---
spokesman
 was obliged
---
the duty should
 have fallen to another tongue
---
I hardly see
---
The
 Council are the Council, and.
---
ye are no longer one of the body would be an irregularity in the proceeding
---
ye were included
---
I have a particular reason for wishing to assist at the ceremony."


---
I think
---
I have expressed the feeling of the
 Council
---
Then I am
---
I am afraid so
---
it is out of the question, indeed.
---
you
 can see the doings full well,."


---
they are
---
opposition crystallized
 it into a determination
---
I am not going any of the rest of the paltry crew!
---
You shall see."


---
The eventful morning was bright, a full- faced sun confronting early
 window- gazers eastward, and
---
they were practised in
 weather- lore)
---
all perceived( for there was permanence in the glow.
---
Visitors soon began
.
---
There was
 hardly a workman in the town who did not put a clean shirt on.
---
they found a difficulty in
 getting back to the proper hour for several days.


---
It was lucky
---
my twenty- one years had expired, or
---
this came on
---
I
 should never have had the nerve to carry it out
---
I am going."


---
Shall we go and?"
---
I have other fish to fry.
---
You see it.
---
the appointed time drew.
---
Suddenly the taller members of the crowd turned their heads, and
---
It was said.

---
the Royal cortege approached
---
The railway had stretched out an arm towards Casterbridge at this time,
 but
---
had not reached it by several miles as yet so the intervening
 distance, as well as the remainder of the journey was.
---
to be traversed
 by road in the old fashion
---
People thus waited-- the county families
 in their carriages, the masses on foot-- and.


---
Elizabeth- Jane watched the scene.
---
Some seats had
 been arranged.

---
ladies could witness the spectacle, and, just at present
---
it seemed
---
Hence this occurred
---
the Corporation in their robes proceeded from the front of the Town
 Hall to the archway erected at the entrance to the town.
---
The carriages
 containing the Royal visitor and arrived at the spot in a
 cloud of dust
---
the whole came on to the
 Town Hall at a walking pace.


---
This spot was the centre of interest.
---
There were a few clear yards in
 front of the Royal carriage, into this space.
---
All the ladies said with bated breath,"!"
---
Elizabeth- Jane peeped through the shoulders of those in
 front,.


---
it was
---
Do you say?"
---
" Oh-- is that all?
---
They have been saying to me
---
What stories people

---
will tell!"


---
They will indeed.
---
It was not so at all.
---
The incident had
, but
---
it was necessarily witnessed by the
 Royal Personage, who, however, with practised tact affected not to have
 noticed anything unusual.
---
the Mayor advanced
---
, was read
---
, the address
 the Illustrious Personage replied,.
---
The ceremony
 occupied but a few minutes, and the carriages.


---
Yet how folk do worship fine clothes!
---
I do like.
---
the trimming pulled off such Christmas candles
---
I am
 quite unequal to the part of villain myself, or
---
I'd gi'e all my small
 silver....
---
lady toppered
---
perhaps I shall soon added
 significantly.


---
That's not a noble passiont for a' oman
---
every one knew.
---
The ideas
 had
 condensed into a scandal, which was spreading like a miasmatic fog
 through Mixen Lane, and thence up the back streets of Casterbridge.


---
The mixed assemblage of idlers known to each other presently fell apart
 into two bands by a process of natural selection.


---
the frequenters of
 Peter's Finger going off Mixen Lanewards, where most of them lived,

---
connection remained in the
 street
---
You know
---
what's brewing down there
---
" I suppose?
---
, said Buzzford
 mysteriously to the others.


---
Not the skimmity- ride?"

 nodded.


---
I have my doubts
---
it will be carried out
---
they
 are getting it up
---
If they are keeping it mighty close.


---
I heard a fortnight ago, at all events."


---
they were thinking of it
---
I were sure o't I'd lay information
---
We know
---
if that's their business, not ours."


---
it must
 be owned.
---
the Mayor and man of money, engrossed with affairs and
 ambitions
---
that would have animated it in former days
---
we make inquiration into it, Christopher," continued Longways
---
we find?"


---
there's really anything in it,
---
This course was decided on, and.
---
the group separated,;
---
's move on
---
There's nothing more to
 see here."


---
had they known
---
the great jocular plot really was
---
a wind- up to the
 Royal visit will be all the more pat by reason of their great
 elevation to- day."


---
at least it was not a joke, but a retaliation.





---
an
 intoxicating Weltlust had fairly mastered
---
they had brought her a
 great triumph nevertheless.
---
the chit- chat, that seemed not the wildest vision
---
So
 you've had a snub
---
I have?
---
Why I've had one too
---
", so we are both under the same cold shade."
---
I were a bull breaking fence
---
I
 took it like a lamb,.
---
I saw
---
it could not be settled there
---
It must come to a tussle-- face to face; and
---
then we'll see!"


---
the
 crowning degradation had been reserved for this day--.


---
The crowds had dispersed.
---
which still stood

---
they were erected
---
Casterbridge life had resumed its ordinary shape.

---
Nobody was present, for,.
---
the labourers and
 carters were enjoying a half- holiday on account of the events of the
 morning--
---
the carters would have
---
I'm stronger
 than he
---
It was empty except of a few sacks, and.
---
was the door

---
that hoisted the
 sacks
---
There was a
 depth of thirty or forty feet to the ground
---
when Elizabeth- Jane had seen
---
how long green door opened and
---
which told
---
here's a hand
---
And my trusty fiere,
              And gie's a hand o' thine."


---
I ca n't do
 it!
---
Why does the infernal fool begin that now!"


---
Will ye come up here?
---
I could n't see ye.
---
What's wrang?"


---
are you doing up here at this time
---
it went tight into its frame
---
we stand face to face-- man and man
---
Your
 money and your fine wife no longer lift' ee above me as they did but
 now, and
---
my poverty does not press me down."


---
does it all mean?"
---
You should thought twice.
---
I've stood your rivalry,
 which ruined me, and your snubbing, which humbled me; but your hustling,

---
that disgraced me
---
I wo n't stand!"


---
you forward stripling
---
You insulted Royalty, Henchard; and."


---
I am as loyal as you, come to
 that!"


---
I am not here.
---
you cool doon,
---
you cool
---
you will see things the same way as I do
---
You may be the one to cool first
---
Now this
 is the case.
---
Here be we, in this four- square loft,.
---
little wrestle you began this morning
---
There's the door, forty foot
 above ground.
---
One of us puts the other out by that door
---
two the master
 stays inside.
---
the other has fallen out by accident
---
I've tied one arm.
---
D'ye understand?
---
unquestionably it should be through the door.


---
thus far the struggle had very much the appearance of the ordinary
 wrestling of those parts
---
Several minutes were passed by them in this
 attitude.
---
the pair rocking and
---
both
 preserving an absolute silence
---
their breathing could be
 heard.
---
the struggle proceeded as before
---
all the efforts of that infuriated Prince
 of Darkness----
---
not they had got
 far back again from the fatal door
---
it used
,
---
Your life is in my hands."


---
Ye've wished to long enough!"


---
their eyes met.
---
Farfrae!--that's not true!
---
God is my witness....
---
I did thee at one time
---
I
 came here
---
now though to kill' ee I can not hurt thee!
---
you will
---
Go and give me in charge-- do
 what I care nothing for what comes of me!"


---
Its womanliness sat tragically on the figure of so stern a piece of
 virility.
---
the thin shades thickened to opaque obscurity, and
 the loft- door became an oblong of gray light-- the only visible shape
 around
---
gropingly descended the steps
---
me and
 despise me for ever
---
There was no help for it but.
---
the Casterbridge lights
 glimmering at no great distance off
---
They were a
 confusion of rhythmical noises, to which the streets added yet more
 confusion by encumbering them with echoes.
---
the clangour arose from the town band
---
they would have brought down
 upon their heads the vengeance of those among their comrades who enjoyed
 these boisterous old games; and therefore the plan of sending a letter
.


---
they took no protective measure,.


---
there was some truth in the scandal,
---
It was about eight o'clock, and
---
the candles lighted,
---
it were not too cold
---
The day had been such
 a success, and
---
these and other subjects mingled was disturbed by
 a hubbub in the distance
---
The reverie in which increased moment by moment.
---
the afternoon having been given up to recreation
 by a majority of the populace since the passage of the Royal equipages
---
at once riveted to the matter by the voice of a
 maid- servant next door,
---
be they going now?"
---
I ca n't be sure for a moment
---
" said the second," because of the
 malter's chimbley.
---
I can see'em.
---
I declare!"


---
I declare
---
They are coming up Corn Street after all!
---
They sit back to back!"


---
" What-- two of' em are there two figures?"


---
Two images on a donkey, back to back their elbows tied to one
 another's!
---
Is it meant for anybody in particular?"


---
it mid be.
---
The din was increasing now
---
then it lessened a little.


---
There I sha n't see, after all!"
---
They have gone into a back street
---
that's all
---
-- said the one who
 occupied the enviable position in the attic.
---
There now I have got'em
 all endways nicely!"


---
I can tell in a moment."


---
' tis
 meant for one I've in mind
---
Elizabeth- Jane advanced into the
 firelight.


---
I have come
---
I did not stop to
 knock
---
I see."


---
you have not shut your shutters, and
---
the window
 is open
---
it be-- hush
---
Their intercourse
 had been so low and hurried
---
Again Elizabeth- Jane attempted, but
---
the latter knew it already
---
us shut it out
---
us shut it out
---
It is of no use
---
it will kill me--!"


---
Elizabeth- Jane was frantic now.
---
ca n't something be done?
---
Is there nobody to do it-- not one?"


---
I will see it
---
The numerous
 lights round
---
the two effigies threw them up into lurid distinctness
---
it
 was impossible.


---
me shut the window
---
The roars of sarcastic laughter went off in ripples, and
---
the
 trampling died out like the rustle of a spent wind.
---
who remained convulsed on the carpet in the paroxysms of
 an epileptic seizure
---
the probability
 being.


---
the servants had run out of the house
---
they could see within
---
who had been agape on the doorstep
---
a light was obtained
---
as soon as what had passed the fit

---
The doctor arrived with unhoped- for promptitude
---
the uproar meant
---
This is serious
---
It is a fit
---
The
 doctor returned to the bedside again.
---
they
 soon heard.


---
has been already made,
---
there were two in the
 town,.


---
they
 might be
---
can we two poor lammigers do against such a multitude!"
 
---
that would be the death of the
 perpetrator; and
---
we would n't be the cause of a fellow- creature's death
 on no account, not we
---
Here I'll come with you.
---
We'll see.
---
what a few
 words of authority can do
---
have you got your staves?"


---
We did n't want
---
the folk to notice us as law officers,
---
being so
 short- handed, sir so we pushed
---
our Gover'ment staves up this
 water- pipe."


---
Ah, here's Mr.
 Blowbody that's lucky."
---
Blowbody was the third of the three borough
 magistrates.)


---
" Well, what's the row?" said Blowbody.
---
you go with Mr.
 Blowbody round by the Old Walk and
---
I'll go with
 Stubberd straight forward.
---
we shall have'em between us.

---
Thus they started.
---
the sounds had proceeded
---
as whence they were surprised that no
 procession could be seen.
---
The lamp flames waved
---
the Walk trees soughed
---
, a few
 loungers stood about with their hands in their pockets.
---
Everything was
 as usual.


---
Have you seen?
---
a motley crowd making a disturbance
---
Beg yer pardon, sir?" blandly said.
---
the person addressed,
---
who was no
 other than Charl, of Peter's Finger
---
we haven't

---
you was here
---
that's odd
---
I know by sight
---
Have you
---
have you seen any gang of fellows making a devil of a
 noise-- skimmington riding, or something of the sort?"


---
I've not been far tonight, so perhaps--
---
' twas here-- just here said the magistrate.


---
Now I've noticed
---
the wind in the Walk trees
 makes a peculiar poetical- like murmur to- night, sir
---
d'ye think?
---
I'm a fool
---
They must
 have gone into the back street."


---
however could the
 disturbers be perceived, and
---
who
 came up at this time
---
Blowbody and the second constable, brought similar intelligence.
---
Effigies, donkey,
 lanterns, band had disappeared like the crew of Comus.


---
there's only one thing
---
we can do
---
I'm much mistaken."


---
you do n't find a clue to the perpetrators
 there
---
The rusty- jointed executors of the law mustered assistance as soon as
 they could, and
---
the whole party marched off to the lane of notoriety.
---
It
 was no rapid matter to get there at night,.
---
which could not be closed because of the smoky chimney within
---
last
 they entered the inn boldly, by the till.


---
guyed to the ceiling by cords as
 usual for stability
---
an ordinary group sat drinking and smoking with
 statuesque quiet of demeanour.
---
The landlady looked mildly at the
 invaders,.
---
there's
 plenty of room
---
I hope?"


---
there's nothing amiss
---
They looked round the room."
---
I saw you by now in Corn Street-- Mr
---
who was Charl
---
I've been here this
 last hour, hain't
---
you have
---
I came in for my quiet suppertime half- pint, and

---
you were here then, as well as all the rest."


---
that's
---
we keep here
---
when
 there's a little quiet dancing
---
You see,
---
damp weather spoils it so I put
 it there."


---
The constable nodded knowingly, but
---
what was nothing.
---
Nohow
 could be elicited from this mute and inoffensive assembly.
---
the investigators went out, and
---
who had been left at the door
---
joining those of their
 auxiliaries they pursued their way
 elsewhither.





---
it all meant
---
They crossed the way,.
---
the roysterers having vanished.
---
what had occurred
---
how they had set out
---
( lest no messenger was despatched towards Weatherbury.
---
which clothed the heights
 on either hand
---
the slow wind making its moan among
 the masses of spruce and larch of Yalbury Wood; but presently there came the sound of light wheels
.


---
accompanied by the distant glimmer of lights
---
It was a point in the highway
---
the road to Mellstock branched
 off from the homeward direction.
---
It soon appeared.
---
the
 light swerving towards Cuckoo Lane, the by- road aforesaid
---
the horse to turn several steps into the branch lane

---
There's something
 wrong at your house--.
---
I've run all the way here on
 purpose."


---
what was only too obvious
---
where an assailant might have confederates
---
I have
---
the matter is more serious than your business
 at Mellstock
---
I can tell you particulars
."


---
we go along
---
I know."
---
you think
---
I am not!"
---
you
 think
---
I know no more; and

---
they want.
---
you to come
---
my heart is true to
 you still!"


---
there might be
 ironies now.
---
at least there was.
---
the adjoining woodland shade
 afforded inadequate illustration
---
the door opened
---
they all said in grievous
 disappointment,"!"
---
said the doctor.


---
I can not tell' ee!"
---
"

" H'm said the surgeon, returning upstairs.


---
who formed one of the group
---
I fear!"


---
Death was and Farfrae and himself the
 shells.
---
There had been affection in it, and.
---
that was good
 and pure
---
the latter entered
 the door
---
Somebody has called for you,"
---
A messenger was despatched to Budmouth,
---
late it had grown
---
as the night
 wore on, and
---
the other doctor came in the small hours.
---
lest talking
 should be dangerous,
---
there was plenty of time
---
an apprehensive guess having been given as to its cause by the
 leaders in the exploit,
---
compunction and fear threw a dead silence over
 all particulars of their orgie
---
when they were alone in the solitude of
 that sad night
---
who called the hours and weather in Casterbridge
 that night there
---
the watchman walked a figure up and down Corn Street hardly less
 frequently.
---
It was; and
---
Henchard's whose retiring to rest had proved itself
 a futility as soon as attempted
---
Lucifer was fading into day across Durnover Moor,
.
---
the sparrows were just alighting into the street, and
---
the hens had begun

---
which had muffled it
---
so little
 did they believe in human aggression at so early a time
---
Why do you take off that?"
---
they may knock as
 loud as they will
---
when a gentle
 footstep approached the house and
---
Have you heard?
---
I know it
---
I have
---
It
 is so very good of' ee, Elizabeth, to come and tell me.
---
You must be
 so tired out, too, with sitting up.
---
Now do you bide here with me this
 morning.
---
You can go and; and
---
I will call' ee when
 breakfast is ready."


---
whose death
 in such fulness of life and was
 appallingly unexpected.
---
it were an honour
---
that way alone could happiness
---
though
 lie
---
said the stranger with profuse heartiness.

---
I am talking to?"


---
Then I've caught' ee at home--
---
that's right.
---
Morning's the time for
 business
---
Can I have a few words with you
---
You may remember me?
---
perhaps you may not.
---
The other did not notice it.
---
I
 know the name well
---
I make no doubt of that.
---
the fact is.
---
I've been looking for' ee
 this fortnight past
---
I landed at Havenpool and and
---
when I got there
---
they told me.
---
you had
---
Back came I again, and.'
---
long
 and late I got here by coach, ten minutes ago
---
So here I am.
---
I've called about
---
I was younger then
---
I am now, and
---
I can not even allow.
---
I was not in my senses, and
---
We were young and thoughtless
---
However I've come.
---
you know
---
I know it,
---
I know it.
---
I found it out directly
---
it was not in my heart
---
when the deed was done
---
I thought, and.
---
there was not much
 vanity in thinking it,
---
Your child died
---
all went well.
---
mind me a time always does come
---
A time came--
---
it was
---
then came the question of our child
---
I did it, for
---
I thought.
---
it was best
---
When I got to the other side of
 the Atlantic
---
there was a storm, and
---
it was supposed.
---
a lot of
 us, including myself had been washed overboard
---
I got ashore at
 Newfoundland, and
---
then I asked myself.


---
I should do
---
I'm here
---
Since here I'll bide,'
---
I thought to myself;' but.'
---
I thought,';

---
the child will have
 a home
---
I've never returned to this country till a month ago, and
---
I
 found.
---
I supposed
---
They told me in Falmouth.
---
Surely you learnt that too?"


---
The sailor started up, and.
"
---
" traveller inquired.


---
The sailor continued.
---
My journey hither has been for nothing
---
I may as
 well go!
---
I came
---
It has served me right.
---
I'll trouble you no longer."


---
It had been the impulse of a
 moment.
---
yet such questioning had not
 come.
---
surely they would come
---
The coach Newson had come by.
---
faith so simple as to be almost sublime.
---
The young
 sailor was still
.


---
Was Elizabeth- Jane?"
---
some of whom might be Casterbridge people; and.


---
the
 trick would be discovered
---
no figure appeared.

---
cooled by years,
---
I had no sooner lain down than I napped,
.
---
I did not mean to
---
I wonder; but
---
I did not.
---
How strange it is that
 we do not often dream of latest events,."


---
they may be
---
I am glad you have been able to sleep
---
which gave her a pleasant surprise
---
They sat down to breakfast, and
---
Their sadness added charm to a countenance.


---
whose beauty had

---
it is so kind of you to get this nice breakfast with your own
 hands, and
---
I idly asleep the while."


---
I do it every day
---
You have left me
---
" everybody has left
 me."


---
how should I live but by my own hands
---
You are very lonely
---
are you not?"


---
you know nothing of
---
It is my own fault.

---
You are the only one who has been near me for weeks.
---
you will come
 no more."


---
Why do you say that?
---
Indeed I will would like."


---
it were best.


---
When they had breakfasted
---
There would remain nobody
---
for was of regal power.
---
hard fate had ordained.


---
there was nothing
 to come, nothing to wait for.
---
The thought of it was unendurable.


---
much
 water flowed
---
who should stand still
 for a few moments on a quiet night
---
The wanderer in this direction, might hear singular symphonies from
 these waters, as from a lampless orchestra,.
---
all playing in their sundry
 tones from near and far parts of the moor
---
they executed a recitative
---
where a tributary brook fell over a stone

---
they trilled cheerily
---
At a hole in a rotten weir
 breastwork they performed a
 metallic cymballing, and
---
they hissed.
---
The spot rose.


---
loudest was a place called Ten Hatches,
 whence during high springs there
---
The river here was deep and strong at all times, and
---
the hatches on this
 account were raised and.
---
lowered by cogs and a winch
---
A patch led
 from the second bridge over the highway( so often mentioned) to these
 Hatches,.
---
night- fall were seldom found.


---
the path
 leading only to a deep reach of the stream called Blackwater, and the
 passage being dangerous
---
stone bridge, and thence struck into this path of solitude,

---
thrown upon the river by the weak lustre that
 still lingered in the west
---
no creature appeared in view.
---
formed by the wash of
 centuries
---
it was indistinct by reason of the shadow from the bank; but
---
it emerged
 thence and.


---
which was that of a human body
---
imparted by the central flow
---
the form was

---
one might have done in the actual presence of an
 appalling miracle
---
Elizabeth- Jane was standing there.
---
I thought.
---
you seemed very sad this morning
---
so I have come
 again
---
Not I am anything but sad myself.
---
everybody
 and everything seem against you so, and
---
I know you must be suffering."


---
Are miracles,
---
do ye think, Elizabeth
---
I do n't know so much as I could wish.
---
I have tried
; but
---
the more I try."


---
the more
 ignorant I seem
---
I do n't quite think
---
there are any miracles nowadays
---
will you come and
, and
---
I will show' ee what I mean."


---
it was
---
It seemed.


---
Are they like mine
---
they are.
---
I wonder!"


---
us go away
---
then we will get home."


---
do you say now
---
us go home
---
-- what is it floating there
---
The effigy answered hastily.
---
They must have thrown it into the
 river higher up amongst the willows at Blackwater,, and
---
to get rid of it in
 their alarm at discovery by the magistrates
---
it must have floated
 down here.
---
where is the other?
---
Elizabeth- Jane thought and."
---
these words kept me alive,"
---
they slowly retraced their way to the town, and
---
May I live with you, and?
---
I used
---
I do not mind
.
---
your being poor
---
I would have agreed, but."


---
you did

---
May you come to me?
---
you only would come!
---
I will
---
How will you forgive all my roughness in former days?
---
I have forgotten it.
---
each went home.
---
the fact turned out
---
Elizabeth- Jane had stated
---
as little as possible was said of the
 matter, and
---
the figures were privately destroyed.


---
the figure should have been floating there
---
Elizabeth- Jane heard!
---
Who is such a reprobate as I
---
yet it
 seems!"





---
even I be in Somebody's hand
---
the emotional conviction that began.
---
which had given that feeling birth
---
Casterbridge had for the last time.
---
The time having come.

---
Disastrous as the result had been
---
it was obviously in no way foreseen
 or intended by the thoughtless crew who arranged the motley procession.

---
who stand at the
 head of affairs
---
who writhe
 under the heel of the same
---
Other considerations
 were also involved.
---
it was not altogether desirable.
---
which some of the Town Council, had

---
Here they settled themselves; and
---
paternal regard
 was heightened by a burning jealous dread of rivalry
---
the coveted treasure had not been deliberately told to that end
---
Thus they lived on in the shop overlooking the churchyard, and
---
nothing
 occurred.
---
it was,
---
it was not
---
their judgment has

---
It
 was inevitable.
---
which must have come sooner or later in any circumstances
---
the stepfather and daughter enjoyed much serenity in the pleasant, sunny
 corner in which it stood.
---
who brimmed with an
 inner activity
---
The quiet bearing of one characterized Elizabeth- Jane at this period.
---
You have got a new muff, Elizabeth
---
I bought it
---
it lay on an adjoining table
---
The fur was of a
 glossy brown, and,
---
it seemed an unusually good one
---
Rather costly I suppose
---
my dear was it not
---
It was rather above my figure
---
it is not
 showy."


---
when the year had advanced into another spring
---
The present room was much
 humbler, but.
---
Their number and quality made the meagre furniture that
 supported them.
---
Some must
 have been recently purchased; and
---
before the courage to speak an event happened.


---
The busy time of the seed trade was over, and
---
that
 preceded the hay- season
---
the quiet weeks had come--.
---
whose very plumes, like those of Juno's bird, are set with
 Argus eyes.


---
whenever possible admirers are within ken
---
Thereupon promptly came to the surface
 that idiosyncrasy of
---
Time had been.
---
when such instinctive opposition would have taken shape
 in action
---
Elizabeth- Jane started at the question; and
---
it was with some confusion
."


---
that's right
---
" Oh-- that's right....
---
It was only."
---
when we both were there
---
which had
---
lest
 silence should allow
---
There was nothing secret in Elizabeth- Jane's movements beyond what
 habitual reserve induced, and
---
when they
 chanced
---
screened by its enclosure
---
them meet
---
I do not wish."


---
The meeting was of a very innocent kind, and
---
is it not so?"
 
---
I have chosen this road latterly.
---
I have no great reason
 for it.
---
that may make a reason for others
---
it is
---
My reason however such as is."


---
I wish
---
there
 will be any good in secrets
---
A secret cast a deep shadow over my life.

---
you know."


---
it was
---
I wonder
!"


---
I ought
---
It gives me more pleasure to get them for you, than you!"


---
It can not.
---
They proceeded along the road together.


---
they reached the town, and

---
their paths diverged
---
they might mean.
---
their marriage would create
---
such a possibility impending
---
The meetings seemed.


---
nobody was near
---
When they were gone their way
---
The chief looming trouble
 in this engagement had not decreased.
---
father- in- law intimate they could never be
---
I am content
---
content with the
 prospect as now depicted was hard to acquire.


---
There is an outer chamber of the brain in which thoughts unowned,
 unsolicited, and of noxious kind
---
they came
---
God forbid such a thing
---
Why should
 I still be subject to these visitations of the devil,?"




43.



---
when I try so hard

---
What thus early was,.
---
naturally enough seen at a little
 later date by other people
---
the simple perambulating term being used hereabout; and
---
the nineteen superior young ladies of Casterbridge, each indignantly left off
---
this looming choice
 of the Scotchman's gave unmixed satisfaction
---
they took a
 kindly interest in their career, not unconnected, perhaps, with visions
 of festive treatment at their hands hereafter.
---
Mrs. Stannidge, having
 rolled into the large parlour one evening and
---
that's
 my opinion.
---
I see much good in it
---
he've
 done
---
' I knowed this one first
---
Thus they talked at the Mariners.
---
we must guard against a too
 liberal use of the conventional declaration.
---
a great sensation was

---
that caused by the prospective event,
---
all the gossips' tongues were set
, and so- on,
---
even such a declaration might lend
 some eclat to the career of our poor only heroine
---
When all has been

---
said about busy rumourers.
---
a superficial and temporary thing is the
 interest of anybody in affairs which do not directly touch them
---
they would be heartily glad to get out of the way.
---
The privilege of being in the house would almost outweigh the personal humiliation.


---
this were a dim possibility or the reverse
---
it evidently now was
---
Two miles out a quarter of a mile from the highway was the prehistoric fort called Mai Dun, of huge dimensions and many
 ramparts, within or upon whose enclosures a human being as seen from
 the road
---
it was the
 original track laid out by the legions of the Empire
---
when a masculine figure came along
 the road from Budmouth, and
---
the lenses revealed.


---
It was, and
---
that could be called a waiting
 which was a transfixture
---
Elizabeth- Jane did not come.
---
other had caused.
---
did
 that amount to?
---
I have had a letter--.
---
a strange
 one-- not signed
---
Somebody has asked me.
---
I do n't understand it; but between you and me
---
I think
.
---
I did not like.
---
I had seen you
---
Shall I go?"


---
this little shop can be managed by you alone as well as by us

---
" Yes, I do n't care about shops and streets and folk--
---
I would rather get
 into the country by myself, out of sight, and."


---
I am sorry
---
you have decided on this
---
I thought it probable-- possible--!"


---
I did not know
---
you disapproved of the
 step
---
I approve of anything you desire to do, Izzy
---
I did not approve
---
If it would be no matter!
---
I wish.
---
My
 presence might make things awkward in the future, and, in short
---
it is
 best."


---
I go
---
that could urge
---
which could argue it away
---
you will not be able to come to my wedding
---
that is not
---
it ought
---
I do n't want
---
to see it I do n't want!"
---
I do n't forbid you
---
Promise not to quite
 forget me meant.


---
weighted by the basket, a perceptible bend
---
which was
 worse than a sob
---
it was so hard and so dry
---
I only had
---
Hard work
 would be nothing to me then!
---
that was not.
---
I-- go alone
-- an outcast and a vagabond.
---
I deserve
---
my punishment is not
 greater than I can bear!"


---
This was
 evidently not their first meeting that day
---
they joined hands without
 ceremony, and
---
did you tell
 him?--I mean of the other matter-- not of ours
---
you will know soon about that.
---
when they reached the Crossways, or
 Bow,
---
they stopped and.


---
the latter
 had seen
---
It was an affecting one, apart from the question of
 paternity.
---
When the
 true facts came
---
I've saved you the trouble!
---
The fact is
---
Faith, says I,' so I will'; and here I am."


---
I was got rather uneasy; but
---
all is, and
."


---
it should be
---
we will have no more deefficulties at all
---
Now that's very much as I thought
---
I now know, and"


---
you are all right
---
can I wish for
 more?
---
I will be glad to see ye here every day now,

---
it can do no harm
---
I've been thinking
---
what is
, and
---
the wedding may as well be kept under my own roof,
---
the house being
 large
---
you being in lodgings by yourself--!"


---
a great deal of
 trouble and expense would be saved ye?--and' tis a convenience when a
 couple's married not to hae far to go to get home
---
ye say
---
as it can
 do no harm,
---
we be talking
 about
---
ye did n't hear
---
you must settle it
---
that's.

---
how we'll have it
---
you provide so much, and houseroom, and
---
as I'll do my part in the drinkables, and
---
maybe a dozen jars will be sufficient?--as many of
---
the folk
 will be ladies, and
---
perhaps they wo n't drink hard enough to make a high
 average in the reckoning?
---
you know best.
---
I'm as ignorant as a child
---
none-- want much of that-- O no!"
---
Do you leave all to me."


---
When they had gone a little further in these particulars
---
I've
 never told ye,
---
have I
---
I thought.
---
I had n't
---
I resolved.
---
I would not remember,
---
I can tell ye.
---
Why I came to
 Casterbridge.
---
I found
 ye out
---
I had been here twice before then.
---
I passed
 through the town on my way westward,
---
I forget
---
where-- that I came back, and
---
The old rascal!--he said."


---
Elizabeth- Jane had died years ago
---
Now it never crossed my mind
---
you'll believe me
---
if I was that upset,.
---
I went back to the coach that had brought me, and
---
Ha- ha!--'twas a good joke, and
 well carried out, and
---
I give the man credit for't!"


---
Elizabeth- Jane was amazed at the intelligence."
---
A joke?--O no cried."
---
when you
 might have been here
---
such was the case
---
I said.
---
I think!"


---
I
 ought
---
the attack upon the absent culprit waxing serious
---
you always were so trusting, father
---
I've heard and
---
Thus they conversed; and
---
Well, well-- never mind it is all over and past
---
"-- said Newson
 good- naturedly.
---
It now
 became apparent.


---
The renowned hill whereon.
---
the annual fair had been held for so many
 generations
---
A
 few sheep grazed thereabout, but
---
these ran off.
---
I was reading a ballet- sheet
---
Then we saw the tent-- that must have stood more this way."
---
it was not really
---
where the tent had stood but
---
Here we went in, and
---
here we sat down.
---
I faced this way.

---
Then I drank, and.
---
It must have been just on that
 very pixy- ring
---
I've lived with thee all this while, and.
---
Now I'm no more.'
---
to' ee-- I'll try my luck elsewhere
---
the superadded
 bitterness of seeing nullified.
---
It was an
 odd sequence.
---
came that
 flower of Nature, Elizabeth
---
it happened.
---
imparted by weariness of
 the world
---
;
 till, by degrees, Casterbridge formed the centre
---
you fool
---
who is no daughter of thine
---
whose course
 was the channel of all such communications.
---
contrived
 by the Gods for reducing human possibilities of amelioration to a
 minimum-- which arranges that wisdom to do
---
the ingenious machinery shall come pari passu with
 the departure of zest for doing
---
wanted by their families
---
despised by
 all
---
the name" Casterbridge uttered one day by the driver of
 a road- waggon
---
who was a stranger
---
I trade up and down,
---
ye know
---
this
 travelling without horses that's getting so common
---
my work will soon be

---
Anything moving in the old place
---
mid I ask?"


---
I've heard.
---
Now is that true or not?"


---
I could n't say for the life o' me.
---
I should think not."


---
you forget
---
What
 were them packages we carr'd there at the beginning o' the week?
---
Surely
 they said
---
a wedding was coming off soon-- on Martin's Day?"


---
the waggon went on
 jangling over the hill.


---
The date
 was an extremely probable one.
---
there being no reason for delay on either
 side
---
it to be
---
that personality could show nothing in keeping
---
when stiffness would have worn
 off
---
bygones would exercise its sway
 in all hearts
---
A rough yet respectable
 coat and hat, a new shirt and neck- cloth were the chief of these; and

---
should that present be?
---
The cage was a plain and small
 one, the shop humble, and
---
the modest sum asked.
---
the other passengers, mainly
 women going short journeys
---
they talked over much local news, not the least portion of this being
 the wedding then in course of celebration at the town they were nearing.

---
It appeared from their accounts, and,
---
the town band had been hired for
 the evening party
---
the convivial instincts of that body
 should get the better of their skill
---
lest the further step had been taken of
 engaging the string band from Budmouth,.


---
there would be a reserve
 of harmony
---
The time was just after twelve o'clock.


---
Those notes were a signal that all had gone well
---
there had been
 no slip' twixt cup and lip in this case
---
The place was unchanged
---
the same larches sighed the same notes; but

---
Elizabeth- Jane had obtained a better home
---
Such an innovation on Casterbridge customs as a flitting of
 bridegroom and bride from the town was
 not likely, but
---
it should have taken place
---
the newly- married couple had gone away, and
---
they had not were at that hour,,
---
it was
 plain to the least observant.
---
that festivity prevailed within, and
---
Idlers were
 standing on the pavement in front; and
---
It was wide open
---
the hall was lighted extravagantly, and.
---
people were

---
a humble old friend had come
---
which was empty
---
as a dance was struck up, and
---
both joined in the figure
---
The door of the front room had been taken off its hinges, and
---
whenever their gyrations brought them
 near the doorway, chiefly in the shape of the skirts of dresses and

---
who had long ago appraised
 life at a moderate value
---
marriage was as a rule no dancing matter
---
That should have had zest for this
 revelry
---
However young people could not be
 quite old people
---
custom was omnipotent.


---
the performers spread out somewhat,
 and
---
The pair were not dancing together, but
---
whenever the chances of the figure made them the partners of a
 moment
---
their emotions breathed a much subtler essence than at other
 times
---
This was strange,
 and
---
it was stranger to find that the eclipsing personage was
 Elizabeth- Jane's partner.
---
That happy face lay in it.
---
It was.


---
who had indeed come and

---
it is-- Mr.
---
I
 see
---
you have another-- a real father in my place
---
Then you know all;
---
Do ye save a little room for me!"


---
I could have loved you
 always--
---
I would have, gladly
---
how can I when know!
---
you
 have deceived me so
---
You persuaded me--
---
me to live on in ignorance of the
 truth for years
---
how can I love!"


---
not the least was this,.


---
Do n't ye distress yourself on my account
---
I would not wish it-- at such a time, too, as this.

---
I have done wrong in coming to' ee
---
I see my error.
---
it is only for
 once,
---
I'll never trouble' ee again, Elizabeth- Jane-- no,
 not to my dying day!
---
It was about a month after the day which closed as in the last chapter.

---
became
 the returned Crusoe of the hour

not Casterbridge
 was difficult to excite by dramatic returns and disappearances through
 having been for centuries an assize town,
---
sensational exits
 from the world, antipodean absences, and such were half- yearly
 occurrences,.
---
The contiguity of salt water proved.
---
which had a bow- window,
---
when the housemaid came in with the announcement
---
we know now
---
how that bird- cage came there
---
strewn by autumn winds, and
---
how the bird and cage had come
 there
---
the poor little songster had been starved to death

---
when the matter had been nearly forgotten
---
it was again

---
we know.
---
how the bird- cage came there
---
who called on the evening of the wedding
---
' tis thoughted.
---
This was enough to set Elizabeth thinking, and
---
the caged bird had been

---
Elizabeth- Jane remembered; and.


---
This was enough; and
---
the serene Minerva- eyes of one made
---
they made further
 inquiries, and
---
who had been working thereabouts
 for weeks
---
which
 skirted the north of Egdon Heath
---
they directed the
 horse's head, and.
---
whose surface never had been stirred to a finger's depth
---
brushed by the feet of the earliest
 tribes
---
The tumuli had left behind, dun and.


---
they were the
 full breasts of Diana Multimammia supinely extended there
---
They searched Egdon, but.
---
they soon passed under.

---
they were following
---
the road had,
---
they were pretty certain
---
which now
 began
---
They were now a score of miles at
 least from home, but,
---
they had just traversed
---
it would be possible
---
that will make
 a hole in a sovereign
---
the elevated
 position disclosed
---
they looked a solitary human form
---
The person was some
 labourer
---
it were not so far away from Casterbridge
---
If I should say.'
---
The possibility led them to alight, and.
---
they approached
.
---
what was of humble dwellings surely the humblest
---
The walls, built of
 kneaded clay originally faced with a trowel, had been worn by years of
 rain- washings to a lumpy crumbling surface,
---
channelled and sunken from
 its plane its gray rents held together here and there by a leafy strap
 of ivy which could scarcely find substance enough for the purpose.
---
The
 rafters were and the thatch of the roof in ragged holes.
---
Leaves
 from the fence had been blown into the corners of the doorway, and.
---
The door was ajar
---
who stood
 before them
---
they had conjectured
---
is it?"
---
ye are heere
---
You see
---
are you talking of?"


---
Did n't ye know it?
---
I've got no watch to my name."


---
faltered Elizabeth- Jane.


---
I seed en
, and
---
I thought.
---
I followed en
 over Grey's Bridge, and
---
You go back
---
I followed, and
---
Do you hear, sir
---
I zeed, and
---
I followed on still.
---
Then' said,''
---
do ye follow me for?
---
when I've told ye
---
I said,'
---
I see, and ye wer kind- like to mother if ye wer rough to me, and I would
 fain be kind- like to you.'
---
things be bad with
' ee
---
I followed; and
---
We walked on like that all night; and

---
I looked ahead o' me,
 and.
---
I zeed, and
---
we
 had got past here
---
I had seen
---
this house was empty, and
---
I went
 by
---
I got; and
---
I took down the boards from the
 windows, and.'
---
can ye
 really be such a poor fond fool
---
Then
 I went on further, and
---
some neighbourly woodmen lent me a bed, and a
 chair, and a few other traps, and.
---
we brought'em here, and
---
we could
---
you see
---
One of the neighbours have gone."


---
is that so!"
---
, so I do n't know.
---
it is
---
I can get it and."


---
They stood in silence.
---
there was
---
I be
---
no sexton be asked
---
nobody is wished
---
no murners walk behind me at my funeral
---
no flours be planted on my grave,
"&
---
I put my name.


---

---
O Donald!" what bitterness lies there!
---
I would not have minded so
 much!...
---
it had not been for my unkindness at that last parting
---
there's no altering--."


---
it must be
---
who wrote them
---
All was over at last,.
---
these were deep and sharp for a good while
---
that offer themselves to everybody not in positive
 pain
---
which thus handled have much of the same inspiring effect upon
 life as wider interests
---
That was no fault of hers.
---
the doubtful
 honour of a brief transmit through a sorry world hardly called for
 effusiveness,
---
even when the path was suddenly irradiated at some
 half- way point by daybeams rich as hers
---
when the one to whom had been

---
whose youth had seemed
