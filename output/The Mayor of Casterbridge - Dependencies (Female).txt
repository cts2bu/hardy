the
 woman enjoyed no society whatever from his presence.
---
Virtually she
 walked the highway alone,.
---
she bore
---
she kept as close to
 his side without actual contact, but
---
she seemed, nor
---
If it was an occasional whisper of the woman to the child-- a tiny girl in
 short clothes and blue boots of knitted yarn-- and the murmured babble of
 the child in reply.


---
The chief-- almost the only-- attraction of the young woman's face was its
 mobility.
---
When she looked down sideways to the girl
---
she became pretty,
 and
---
even handsome particularly that her features
.

---
which made
 transparencies of her eyelids and nostrils and
---
When she plodded on in the shade of the hedge,
---
silently thinking she had the hard, half- apathetic expression of one who deems anything
 possible at the hands of Time and Chance except, perhaps, fair play.
---
the parents of
 the girl in arms could be little doubt.
---
The wife mostly kept her eyes, though with little
 interest-- the scene for
---
No-- no-- the other one said the woman.
---
A haggish creature of about presided, in a white
 apron, which as it threw an air of respectability over her as far as
 it extended, was made so wide as to reach nearly round her waist.
---
She
 slowly stirred the contents of the pot.
---
The dull scrape of her large
 spoon was audible throughout the tent.
---
she thus kept from burning the
 mixture of corn in the grain, flour, milk, raisins, currants, and what
 not
---
that composed the antiquated slop in which she dealt
---
the woman had said and
---
she played
---
when she took a bottle
 from under the table
---
His wife had

---
she agreed to a milder allowance after some
 misgiving.


---
she had

---
the wife more once said
 to her husband," Michael, how about our lodging?
---
she slept.


---
The young woman his wife, acted
, and.
---
she did not hear them
---
who was just
 big enough to be placed for a moment on the bench beside her when she
 wished to ease her arms
---
she's a little holler in the back and
---
her
 left eye knocked out by the kick of another, her own sister,
---
anybody would buy her
---
she's got it-- in the bone,
---
I say-- as much as any
 female in the fair
---
She turned to her husband and.
---
The woman is no good to me.
---
Who'll have her?"


---
The woman whispered
---
she was imploring and anxious:"
---
She waited and
---
The woman's manner changed, and
---
her face assumed the grim shape and
 colour of which mention has been made.

"
---
Will anybody buy her?
---
Her present owner is not at
 all to her liking!"


---
She shall take the girl and.
---
she wants
 to,
---
Do n't my chiel whispered a buxom staylace dealer in voluminous
 petticoats, who sat near the woman
---
The woman however did stand up."
---
The woman looked on the ground,.

"
---
she maintained her position by a
 supreme effort of will
---
they do n't take her for that
---
why she's cost me fifty times
 the money, if a penny.
---
I wo n't sell her for less than five
---
she sha n't go for less.
---
she's yours.

---
She bowed her head with absolute indifference.

"
---
she'll be withdrawn
---
said the woman,.
---
her low dry voice
 sounded quite loud,"
---
the young woman is willing
---
I would n't hurt her feelings for the world."


---
Faith, nor I said her husband.
---
she is willing,.
---
she can
 have the child
---
She said so only the other day when I talked o't!"


---
That said the sailor to her.


---
said she, after glancing at her husband's face and seeing no
 repentance there.


---
Very well she shall have the child, and the bargain's complete
---
The sailor looked at the woman and."
---
She paused for an instant,
 with a close glance at him.
---
Then dropping her eyes again, and saying
 nothing she took up the child and.
---
she turned, and
---
she said,
---
Seizing the sailor's arm with her right hand, and mounting the little
 girl on her left she went out of.


---
Is she gone?
---
she's gone clane enough
---
said the furmity woman,.
---
A comely
 respectable body like her can want more?
---
I glory in the
 woman's sperrit.
---
the woman will be better off
---
she's

---
I'll not go after her!"
---
she's up to such vagaries
---
If she must suffer
 for'em.
---
if the doing again she should n't have her!"


---
She shook
 him, but.
---
As not to be struck that
 night, the fair continuing for two or three days she decided, and his basket
 with him.
---
Extinguishing the last candle, and lowering the flap of the
 tent she left it, and
---
She's gone--.
---
she is
---
who bought her,
---
she must have been somewhat excited to do this
---
that moreover she
 must have believed.
---
There may too have been enough recklessness and resentment
 beneath her ordinary placidity.

---
her stifle any momentary doubts
---
she had replied...."
---
she would not
 hear
---
she knows!
---
I find her
---
Seize
 her why did n't she know!"
---
She was n't.'
---
the
 occupant had just lit her fire
---
that did not
 involve an explanation of the circumstances under which he had lost her
---
now her face had lost much of
 its rotundity
---
; her skin had undergone a textural change; and
---
her
 hair had not lost colour
---
She was.
---
Her companion,
 also in black, appeared as a well- formed young woman about eighteen,
, irrespective of complexion or contour.


---
life's middle summer had set its hardening
 mark on the mother's face
---
While her former spring- like specialities were

---
her child,
 would have seemed for the moment, to one,.


---
The daughter carried in her outer hand
 a withy basket of old- fashioned make; the mother a blue bundle, which
 contrasted oddly with her black stuff gown.


---
The mother and daughter threaded the crowd for some little
 distance, and.


---
said the maiden.


---
she spoke the girl
---
the girl innocently continued.


---
She moved on to another part of
 the field.


---
she gazed round about
---
she now called herself,

---
She
 stirred the contents of the pot with a large spoon, and!"


---
She was here at that time
---
Do n't speak to her-- it is n't respectable!"
---
The girl was not loth, and.
---
her mother went forward
---
The old woman begged for the latter's
 custom as soon as she saw her, and.
---
she had shown in
 selling six- pennyworths in her younger days
---
Her customer smiled bitterly at this survival of the old trick, and

---
the old woman was far from translating.

---
She pretended, and"


---
she did so said blandly to the hag,"?
---
her daughter was still bending over the
 distant stalls
---
she said cautiously to the old
 woman," the sale of a wife by her husband in your tent eighteen years
 ago to- day?"


---
half shook her head.
---
she said.
---
The furmity woman half shook her head again."
---
she said,"
---
a woman ever asked for him
---
She briefly
 thanked her informant, and
---
who greeted her with,

---
rejoined Elizabeth," Mother, do let it was hardly respectable.
---
Henchard's wife acted for the best, but
---
she had involved herself in
 difficulties.
---
she had been upon the point of telling her
 daughter Elizabeth- Jane the true story of her life
---
when she was not much
 older than the girl now beside her
---
she had refrained.
---
An innocent
 maiden had thus grown up in the belief that the relations between the
 genial sailor and her mother were the ordinary ones that they had always
 appeared to be.
---
which had grown with her growth
---
her to live on in the conviction
---
she was by no means the first or last peasant
 woman who had religiously adhered to her purchaser, as too many rural
 records show.


---
Absolutely helpless she had been taken off
 to Canada where they had lived several years without any great worldly
 success,.
---
she worked as hard
---
any woman could
---
that Susan had an awakening
---
she confided her history

---
A friend to whom ridiculed her grave acceptance of her position; and
---
all was over with
 her peace of mind.
---
She saw him no more.


---
when the girl was about eighteen
---
she was sitting on a
 willow chair in the cottage they still occupied,.
---
Her mother was in a back corner of the same room.
---
she was filling

---
she surveyed her daughter thoughtfully
---
The sun shone in at the door
 upon the young woman's head and hair,,.
---
Her face somewhat wan and incomplete possessed the raw materials of beauty in a
 promising degree.
---
She was handsome in the bone,.
---
She possibly might never be fully handsome,.


---
the carking
 accidents of her daily existence could be evaded
---
the mobile parts
 of her countenance had settled to their final mould
---
The sight of the girl made her mother sad-- not vaguely but by logical
 inference.
---
she had tried.

---
so many times to be delivered for the girl's sake
---
The woman had long perceived how zealously and constantly and
---
the young mind
 of her companion was struggling for enlargement;
---
How could she become a woman of wider
 knowledge, higher repute--"better,"--
---
she termed it
---
this was her
 constant inquiry of her mother.
---
She sought further into things than
 other girls in her position, and
---
her mother groaned.


---
she felt

---
she could not aid in the search
---
her views had been disturbed by enlightenment
---
She
 asked herself.
---
the present moment, now was a free woman
 again,
---
she would find in a world
---
where
 everything had been so inopportune, for making a desperate effort to
 advance Elizabeth
---
She finally resolved.
---
This will account for their conversation at the fair and the
 half- informed state at which Elizabeth was led onward.


---
Elizabeth- Jane discovered to her
 alarm, and.


---
her mother's health was not
---
she was

---
her silent mother mused on other things than topography
---
Why surely said Elizabeth,?"


---
The features of the
 town had a keen interest for Elizabeth's mother,.
---
the two women did not know it.


---
the church walked a woman with her gown- sleeves
.
---
the edge of her underlinen was visible, and
---
her
 skirt tucked up through her pocket hole
---
She carried a load under her
 arm
---
she was pulling pieces of bread, and
---
who walked with her, which pieces
---
they inquired of the woman for the nearest baker's.


---
" she said, after directing them.
---
I've been a wife, and
---
I've been a mother, and
---
she knew more of her future
 in this place
---
Not wishing to be observed further till she withdrew with her daughter from the speaker's side.

---
She sat down upon the lowest step, and
---
Elizabeth- Jane obeyed her
 directions and.


---
She ascended to the top of the steps.


---
her head was bowed
---
Her mother though had already caught from the
 inn- window tones that strangely riveted her attention,
---
She arose,
 and.


---
she could do so without
 showing exceptional eagerness
---
The interior of the hotel dining- room was spread out before her, with
 its tables, and glass, and plate, and inmates.
---
Elizabeth encumbered with no
 recollections.
---
her mother was,
---
When last she had seen him
---
Watching
 him, and thus thinking of past days she became.
---
she shrank
 back against the jamb of the waggon- office doorway to which the steps
 gave access, the shadow from it conveniently hiding her features
---
She
 forgot her daughter till a touch from Elizabeth- Jane."
---
whispered the girl.


---
She drew closer, and
---
Elizabeth- Jane had never been so much interested in anything in her life
 as in their present position, partly from the natural elation; and
---
she felt
 at discovering herself akin to a coach
---
she gazed again at the
 scene.
---
" she ventured.


---
I never knowed her.'
---
There was temper under the thin bland
 surface-- the temper which, artificially intensified, had banished a wife
 nearly a score of years before.


---
which
 attracted her both by their subject and by their accent
---
Elizabeth- Jane turned to her companion."
---
The
 evening is drawing on, mother
---
she said.
---
She was surprised to find how irresolute her mother had become.
---
" she murmured.
---
her mother did not reply Elizabeth- Jane's mind.
---
" Let she said.
---
Her mother assented, and
---
she observed and.
---
Elizabeth and her mother were passively accepted as sojourners,
 and.


---
"-- said the elder woman,.


---
said Elizabeth.
---
" before replied her
 mother."
---
leaving the room she descended the stairs and
.


---
there was one good thing more than another which characterized this
 single- hearted girl
---
If it was a willingness to sacrifice her personal
 comfort and dignity to the common weal.


---
As mother's not might I take
 out part of our accommodation by helping?
---
well off, she asked of the landlady.


---
she had been

---
Elizabeth proposed
---
The mistress
 of the house however was an easy woman to strangers, and
---
she made no
 objection.
---
Thereupon Elizabeth being instructed by nods and motions
 from the taciturn landlord as to where she could find the different
 things,.


---
she was doing this the wood partition in the centre of the house

---
she brought
 forth the tray of supper viands, and
---
Thus Elizabeth found.


---
the
 Scotchman was located in a room quite close to the small one that had
 been allotted to herself and her mother
---
When she entered
---
nobody was present but the young man himself-- the
 same whom she had seen lingering without the windows of the King's Arms
 Hotel.
---
she looked at him quite coolly, and
---
She set down the tray,.

---
who was as kind as she was fat
 and lazy
---
Elizabeth- Jane was rather tired, though in her
 earnestness
---
she was waiving her own needs altogether
---
she and
 her mother had
---
Elizabeth fetched their simple provisions,, and.
---
she had fetched the
 Scotchman's
---
where she had left her
 mother,
---
where she
 had left her
---
her mother, was in an erect position, with lips parted.
---
she lifted her finger.


---
The room allotted to the two
 women had at one time.
---
Thus silently conjured Elizabeth deposited the tray, and
---
her mother
 whispered,"' Tis he."


---
she drew near
---
Who said the girl.


---
one
 so perfectly unsuspicious of the truth as the girl was,
---
The girl noiselessly laid
 out their little meal, and
---
her attention being fixed on the
 conversation through the door.


---
Elizabeth- Jane and her mother remained each in her
 thoughts over their meal,.
---
used
 by her mother and herself
---
also she found the bustle of serving to be at its
 height below, as it always was at this hour
---
The young woman shrank from
 having anything to do with the ground- floor serving, and-- so new to her, fresh from the seclusion of
 a seaside cottage.
---
she
 remarked the two or three dozen strong- backed chairs that stood round
 against the wall,; the sanded
 floor; the black settle which, projecting endwise from the wall within
 the door, permitted Elizabeth to be a spectator of all that went on
 without herself being particularly seen.


---
she noticed
 some of those personages who had stood outside the windows of the King's
 Arms.


---
While thus furtively making her survey the opening words of a song
 greeted her ears from the front of the settle, in a melody and accent
 of peculiar charm.
---
she came down
---
she could not help;
 and
---
the longer she listened.
---
the more she was
---
She had never
 heard any singing like this and
---
she could
 imagine a tear in his eye
---
the waiststring of which was overhung so far by
 her sides.


---
she accomplished by rolling herself round, as a cask

---
And to bide in Casterbridge, sir she asked.


---
she looked at Farfrae from the
 back of the settle
---
As she decided.
---
She admired the serious light in which he looked at
 serious things.
---
She
 disliked those wretched humours of Christopher Coney and his tribe; and

---
exactly she felt about
 life and its surroundings
---
She took a candlestick and.
---
When candle in hand she reached the top of the stairs on her way down again
---
She could not very well retreat
---
She must have appeared interesting in some way--
---
not- withstanding her
 plain dress-- or rather possibly she was
 a girl characterized by earnestness and soberness of mien.
---
Her face flushed, too, at the slight
 awkwardness of the meeting, and
---
she passed him with her eyes.
---
she carried just below her nose
---
When soon after the girl rejoined her mother
---
she whispered.
---
her
 mother had known the real relationship
---
If take us up, then find out what when staying here,
' twould grieve and wound his natural pride as Mayor of the town Elizabeth, than she was not much disturbed about
 it.
---
she said,"
---
Thus she earnestly pleaded.


---
When Elizabeth- Jane opened the hinged casement next morning the mellow
 air brought in the feel of imminent autumn almost as distinctly as if
 she had been in the remotest hamlet.
---
one of which she withdrew her head
 and.
---
She saw.
---
she said to herself.
---
she said,.


---
when she turned inwards
---
his relative Susan, a
 sailor's widow was in the town
---
What had brought her to this determination.
---
she enjoined,
---
Thus with a half- hearted willingness, a smothered
 reluctance, did the poor forgiving woman start her unconscious daughter
 on this errand.


---
when Elizabeth paced up the
 High Street
---
her position was only
 that of a poor relation deputed to hunt up a rich one.
---
she could see through the
 passage to the end of the garden-- nearly a quarter of a mile off.


---
She was

---
here she was
.
---
she could
---
a place, into
 which tons of fodder, all in trusses were being packed from the waggons
 she had seen
---
She wandered about this place, uncomfortably conscious of the impending
 interview,
---
she was quite weary of searching
---
till she ventured to
 inquire of a boy in what quarter Mr. Henchard.
---
she was answered by a cry of" Come in
---
Elizabeth turned the handle; and.
---
she was for the moment
---
She said.


---
she wanted
---
where the
 younger of them has already been discovered by Elizabeth
---
she still sat under the Scotchman's eyes
---
She could hear his words to
 Henchard:" Joshua Jopp, sir-- by appointment-- the new manager."


---
She could see
---
is it, my young woman
---
said she.


---
she innocently went on,"
---
Susan is-- still alive
---
Are you her daughter?"


---
His wife had behaved kindly to him
 in return for his unkindness, and.


---
Your mother then is quite well?"


---
She is sir, with travelling."


---
where is your mother staying?"


---
you are her daughter Elizabeth- Jane?"
---
you shall take a note from me to your
 mother
---
She is not left very well off by
 her late husband?"
---
she said,
---
she, was much affected, and
---
tears rose to her
 aerial- grey eyes.
---
she was gone Henchard's state
---
as
 regarded her at least there could be little doubt
---
a few hours
 would settle the question of her mother's identity
---
Elizabeth had reached the inn.
---
Her mother, was much moved at sight of it.
---
She did not read it at once,.
---
Elizabeth's back was turned.
---
when her mother opened the letter
---
The girl seems.
---
it may tacitly have said to her.
---
She waited restlessly for the close of the day,.
---
she was invited
---
she would
 go alone
---
she said nothing to show that the place of meeting was not
 at his house, nor.





---
did she hand the note to Elizabeth
---
, as these: that for scores of years a woman was.
---
Mayor of the
 town could not invite her.


---
she understood
---
Yet if said Susan,.


---
me feel' ee an
 innocent woman
---
she asked, alarmed.

"
---
She can not be told all--
---
she would so despise us!"


---
why she was brought up in ignorance of you
---
we must talk of a plan for keeping her in her present belief, and
.
---
she murmured.


---
the girl discovering our
 disgrace
---
how you can return openly to my house as the wife and
 daughter
---
you and Elizabeth take a
 cottage in the town as the widow Mrs. Newson and her daughter
---
I came here
 for the sake of Elizabeth
---
Quite said she.


---
the girl is quite safe from learning the shame of her case and
."


---
You would be surprised to find how unlikely she is to dream of the
 truth.
---
How could she ever suppose such a thing?"


---
She murmured something; but.


---
his
 wife passed out through the lower way, and
---
I lost my wife
 nineteen years ago or so-- by my own fault....
---
she was walking
 at my side,, our only child
---
now she has come back."


---
Come back has she!"


---
Can ye no take her and?"


---
I wrong another innocent woman."


---
I
 was taken pity on by a woman-- a young lady
---
While in this state I should call her, the daughter of some
 harum- scarum military officer who had got into difficulties, and.
---
she
 was of good family,--
---
she was as
 lonely as I.
---
she took upon
 herself.
---
she got.

---
being together in the same
 house, and her feeling warm we got naturally intimate.
---
She was terribly careless of
 appearances, and
---
she suffered much on my account, and
---
I had not heard of Susan for so
 long
---
she would run the risk of Susan being alive( very slight as I
 believed) and marry me, such as I was
---
She jumped for joy, and
---
no doubt Susan appears!"


---
I had never been so selfish
 as to let this giddy girl devote herself to me over at Jersey, to the
 injury of her name
---
Yet as I must
 bitterly disappoint one of these women; and
---
My first
 duty is to Susan
---
she cannet be your wife,

---
mun in your letter that the first having come back ye cannet see her more; and."


---
she did always brag about her rich uncle or rich aunt, and
 her expectations from' em
---
though I must send a useful sum of money to her just as a little recompense, poor girl....
---
My wife Susan has my daughter
 with her-- the baby that was in her arms at the fair; and
---
this girl knows
 nothing of me beyond.
---
She
 has grown up in the belief that the sailor to whom I made over her
 mother, and who is now dead, was her father, and her mother's husband.

---
her mother has always felt.

---
she and I together feel now--
---
we
 ca n't proclaim our disgrace to the girl by letting her know the truth
---
She'll forgive ye
 both."


---
her know the truth
---
Her
 mother and I be going; and
---
Susan looks upon
 herself as the sailor's widow, and."


---
she's right
---
The letter to the young Jersey woman was

---
the mother and daughter were comfortably installed
---
Elizabeth was
---
his wife was not particularly happy in it
---
This is a very good opportunity for me to ask you to name
 the happy day, Susan
---
The poor woman smiled faintly
---
she did not enjoy pleasantries on a
 situation into which she had entered solely for the sake of her girl's
 reputation.
---
She liked them so little, indeed,.
---
why she had countenanced deception at all, and
---
the girl know her history
---
she said,"!"
---
she looked at
 him and at his dress as a man of affluence, and.

"
---
such a poor fragile woman should be his choice
---
when
 she stepped into the plain brougham which drew up at the door on the
 wedding- day to take her and Elizabeth- Jane to church
---
there--(lowering her voice) tis said
'."


---
a woman of your tonnage have not
---
as respectable born as she
---
True your mother was a very good woman
---
"; I can mind her.
---
She were
 rewarded by the Agricultural Society for having begot the greatest
 number of healthy children without parish assistance, and other virtuous
 marvels.
---
how mother would sing, Christopher
---
how we went with her to the
 party at Mellstock,
---
her face were
 so yaller and freckled, do ye mind?"


---
t'other half woman, may say
---
her eyes twinkled
 between the crevices of their lids--"canst mind the sherry- wine, and the
 zilver- snuffers, and
---
her fall in Dairyman Sweet- apple's cow- barton
---
She'll wish.
---
she's done of him
---
she should pine for deeper
 affection.
---
the two unassuming women
 scarcely made a perceptible addition to its contents.


---
she
 experienced
---
she was treated
---
The freedom went beyond her
 expectations.
---
her mother's
 marriage had introduced her
---
The reposeful, easy, affluent life to which was, in truth, the beginning of a great
 change in Elizabeth.
---
She found.
---
she could have nice personal possessions
 and ornaments for the asking, and
---
she did not lack
---
passed by her thin
 face and figure filled out in rounder and softer curves
---
she had looked upon
---
her lot by nature departed with a change to
 abundance of good things, and
---
;,
 alas, she; the lines and
 contractions upon her young brow the muddiness of skin which
 as came upon her cheek.
---
light- heartedness seemed to her too irrational
 and.
---
she had been
---
She felt none of those ups and downs of spirit
 which beset so many people without cause; never--
---
she knew.


---
her present cheerfulness was fairly proportionate to her
 solid guarantees for the same
---
for the first time in her
 life commanding ready money she would go and
---
Elizabeth
 did
---
This
 unsophisticated girl did it by an innate perceptiveness that was almost
 genius.
---
Thus she refrained from bursting out like a water- flower that
 spring, and clothing herself in puffings and knick- knacks, as most of
 the Casterbridge girls would have done in her circumstances.
---
Her triumph
 was tempered by circumspection
---
she had still that field- mouse fear of
 the coulter of destiny despite fair promise, which is common among the
 thoughtful who have suffered early from poverty and oppression.


---
she would say to herself.
---
We now see her in a black silk bonnet, velvet mantle or silk spencer,
 dark dress, and carrying a sunshade.
---
she drew
 the line at fringe, and.
---
She
 discovered.

---
her skin had grown more sensitive to the sun's rays
---
She protected those cheeks forthwith,.


---
she went out with him more
 frequently than with her mother now.
---
Her appearance was so
 attractive that he looked at her critically.


---
she faltered,
.


---
she
 had donned for the first time
---
rather your mother advises ye
---
Indoors she appeared with her hair.
---
when she was a baby
---
She looked startled,
---
Elizabeth was gone to her own room Henchard
---
the girl's hair
 certainly looked
---
when she was a baby
---
the same uneasy expression came out on her face,.
---
her called
 Miss Henchard-- not Miss Newson
---
Lots o' it is her legal name--
---
it may as well be made her usual
 name
---
She
 wo n't object."


---
she's
 willing
---
she agrees
---
" O yes-- if let she replied.


---
her manner was emotional and full of the
 earnestness of one who wishes to do right at great hazard
---
She went to
 Elizabeth- Jane, whom she found sewing in her own sitting- room upstairs,
 and.
---
what had been proposed about her surname
---
Elizabeth reflected.
---
she answered.


---
When later in the day she saw Henchard
---
,, she adverted to the matter
 at once, in a way which showed that the line of feeling started by her
 mother had been persevered in.
---
she asked.


---
Elizabeth still passed as Miss Newson, and not by her legal
 name.


---
The position of Elizabeth- Jane's room-- rather high in the house, that afforded her opportunity for accurate observation of what went
 on there.
---
She saw.
---
Occasionally she would hear
 a perfect cannonade of laughter from Henchard,.
---
Her quiet eye discerned.
---
looking
 down on their figures from on high she heard the latter remark,."
---
When she walked with her mother, on the other hand
---
she often beheld the
 Scotchman.
---
The fact that met her at the Three Mariners.
---
she had entered his room
---
Besides it was at her mother more particularly than
 at herself.
---
she decided
.


---
She did not divine the ample explanation of his manner, without personal
 vanity, chastened mother who walked by her side.
---
Her conjectures on that past
 never went further than faint ones based on things casually heard and
 seen-- mere guesses.


---
she thought.
---
she had put on her bonnet
---
However she entered and.
---
Presently she saw a figure approaching
 the gate-- that of Donald Farfrae.
---
she quickly ascended the step- ladder leading to the granary
 door, and
---
where she had just been standing
---
,
, could it be herself?
---
she had
---
herself received
---
the longer she waited.
---
she had been in hiding there
---
she still waited on
---
A winnowing machine stood close
 beside her, and
---
she gently moved the handle;
.
---
a cloud of wheat husks flew out into her face, and
---
Elizabeth held
 out her note.

" No.
---
' Tis a great liberty said Elizabeth.


---
, she inquired.


---
her side hair, and her neck, and the crown of her
 bonnet, and the fur of her victorine, saying,""
  at every puff
---
she was fairly clean,
---
She declined the offer,.
---
looking thoughtfully at her diminishing figure, and whistling in
 undertones I came down through Cannobie."

---
she was but a poor illustrative instance of
 the prophet Baruch's sly definition
---
When she walked abroad
---
she seemed, and.
---
She formed
 curious resolves on checking gay fancies in the matter of clothes,
.
---
it was inconsistent with her past life
---
she had become
---
She wanted, but
---
she had no bonnet that would harmonize.
---
she thought.
---
she would have such a bonnet
---
When she had a
 bonnet that would go with the gloves she had no dress that would go with
 the bonnet.
---
she ordered the
 requisite article, and.
---
she had no sunshade
---
she bought the sunshade, and
---
her bygone simplicity was
 the art that conceals art, the" delicate imposition" of Rochefoucauld
---
she had produced an effect, a contrast, and
---
this was not true, but; for as
 soon as Casterbridge thought her artful it thought her worth notice."
---
she said
 to herself."


---
But sex had never before asserted itself in her so strongly,
 for in former days.
---
she had perhaps been too impersonally human to be
 distinctively feminine
---
she came
 indoors,.
---
When she had thought it over
---
her usual fear of exaggerating appearances
 engendered a deep sadness.
---
she
 mused.
---
She looked from the window and
---
when some of the women were
---
were Elizabeth and her mother-- the former thoughtful yet
 much interested
---
her eyes beaming with a longing lingering light,.
---
his wife should be disposed
---
The tune
 had enticed her into it
---
the girl looked at Henchard for approval; but
.
---
she had made a mistake of some kind
---
she did

---
she learnt
---
she had not been quite in
 her place in treading a measure amid such a mixed throng.


---
Thereupon her ears, cheeks, and chin glowed like live coals at the
 dawning of the idea.


---
her tastes were not good enough for her
 position, and
---
This made her very miserable, and but Mrs. Henchard, who had less idea of conventionality than Elizabeth
 herself, had gone away, leaving her daughter to return at her own
 pleasure.
---
she looked about for her mother;

---
She thought, but did not utter
 any objection.
---
She faltered," Why?"


---
She said.


---
she could not dance-- in any proper way
---
This seemed such a melancholy prospect that Elizabeth- Jane breathed
 a sigh-- letting it off in fragments that he might not hear her.

---
she remained incompetently silent
---
Never said she.


---
That she said earnestly.
---
she was doing
---
she started."
---
she reached
 her father's door
---
she thought,
---
she pulled
 up breathless
---
she fell to conjecturing the meaning of Farfrae's enigmatic
 words
---
Elizabeth, that
 silent observing woman had long noted; and
---
knowing Henchard's nature now she had feared.
---
so the announcement gave
 her little surprise
---
she took indoors, and
---
she
 much admired
---
she laid the latter over" Sir,".
---
When she saw the effect
---
a quick red ran up
 her face and.
---
she
 had done
---
She quickly tore up the slip, and.
---
she grew cool and.


---
Elizabeth- Jane's anxiety to know
 if reached a pitch that disturbed
 her,.
---
she could no longer conceal from herself the cause
---
the news reached her.
---
Her heart fluttered
---
when she heard of this step of Donald's,
---
who cared one little bit
 for her
---
To solve the problem her appearance on the evening of the dance
 were
---
whether such as to inspire a fleeting love at first sight she dressed
 herself up--
---
exactly she had dressed then
---
was in her opinion, precisely of such a kind, and
---
she said luminously; and.


---
Elizabeth thought, in a much
 lower key,
---
when she felt
---
Hence she would say to
 herself with a mock pleasantry that carried an ache with it,"!"
---
She tried, and thinking of him; succeeding fairly well in
 the former attempt, in the latter not so completely.


---
when she entered
---
Seeing she
 appeared alarmed.


---
She hesitated for a moment, and"


---
When she had gone
---
She on her part has promised; and
---
his wife had not ventured.


---
she would have welcomed gladly
---
Elizabeth- Jane's mother inadvertently
 alluded to her favourite's movements
---
If at breakfast or dinner the girl would implore her by a
 look; and
---
There came a shock which had been foreseen for some time by Elizabeth,
.


---
Her mother was ill-- too unwell to leave her room.
---
who treated
 her kindly
---
she rallied.


---
Elizabeth, did not appear at breakfast on the
 second morning, and
---
she at length perceived
---
she was bound
---
she went on
---
you really did set before
 me in your grim way the fact of there being a certain risk in intimacy
 with you, slight as it seemed to be after fifteen or sixteen years of
 silence on your wife's part
---
She is rich,
 and
---
ever LUCETTA breathed heavily."
---
she had appointed
---
there was no Lucetta
 inside or out.
---
She could not
 go out of doors any more.
---
which seemed to
 distress her
---
she said.
---
she wanted
---
A desk was put
 upon her bed with pen and paper, and.

---
she was left alone
---
She remained,.

---
She had directed it in these words:--

" MR.
---
The latter sat up with her mother to the utmost of her strength night
 after night.
---
the silence in Casterbridge-- barring the rare
 sound of the watchman-- was broken in Elizabeth's ear only by the
 time- piece in the bedroom ticking frantically against the clock on the
 stairs; ticking harder and harder;
 and all this
---
the subtle- souled girl asking herself
---
why she was
 born
---
Between the hours at which till to clang like a gong while, why sitting in a room, and blinking at the candle why things
 around her had taken the shape they wore in preference to every other
 possible shape.
---
Why they stared at her so helplessly,
---
as if waiting
 for the touch of some wand chaos called consciousness, which spun in her at
 this moment like a top,.
---
Her eyes fell together
---
she was awake, yet
---
she was asleep.


---
A word from her mother roused her.
---
" Why said Elizabeth, with a start.


---
Elizabeth- Jane bent down her head so much that she looked
 quite into her own lap.
---
her mother did not go on
---
as she said," What
 reason?"


---
" murmured the girl.


---
her mother was silent, and
; and
---
she spoke on the subject no more.


---
who had been standing there for
 an indefinite time with her pitcher
---
she had learnt them from the nurse
---
she was white as marble- stone
---
And she said.'
---
' Twas a cannibal deed! deprecated her listeners.


---
she's helpless,"
 ."
---
all her shining keys will be took from her,
 and little things
---
her cupboards opened; and
---
her wishes and ways will be as nothing!"




19.



---
Yes, sir often she said.


---
" she said quickly.
---
Henchard's wife was
---
that was the girl
---
did your mother tell you about me-- my history?
---
She should have told more--!
---
The back of Elizabeth's head remained still, and
---
her shoulders did not
 denote even the movements of breathing.
---
Your mother and I were man and wife.
---
Your mother was too honest.
---
when she believed
---
to give details a whole series of slight and
 unregarded incidents in her past life, in
 short, she became greatly agitated,
 and.


---
turning round to the table flung her face upon it
---
She tried; but
---
she could not;
---
she
 was
---
I, my daughter your
 mother wanted it Susan.
---
she heard
---
she had moved, or
---
Your mother was against it, but
---
she asked.


---
why mother did n't wish it
---
" she answered.
---
She got a piece of paper, and
---
the bewildered girl could realize, or
---
She was
 thankful that he had left her to herself for the evening, and sat down
 over the fire.
---
Here she remained in silence, and but for the genial sailor Richard Newson, to whom she seemed
 doing a wrong.


---
Elizabeth was
 his at last and
---
she was a girl of such good sense and kind heart that
 she would be sure to like him.
---
she had

---
Some trifling fancy or other of poor Susan's I suppose
---
she died three months after that, and
---
I christened her by the same name we had given to the first,
 and she filled up the ache
---
a
 woman forgives you.


---
It furnished another
 illustration of that honesty in dishonesty which had characterized her
 in other things.


---
She was breathing profoundly.
---
it fell slantwise on her face without
 shining on her eyes
---
His wife
 was dead, and
---
she was beyond him
---
she should always think herself, no matter
 what hyprocrisy it involved.


---
" thought all night of it she said frankly.
---
she spoke with tears in her eyes)
---
she said cheerfully.


---
which ever confronted a girl
---
which had carried the point of affection with her
---
she had
 never seen it before
---
One grievous failing of
 was her occasional pretty and picturesque use of dialect
 words-- those terrible marks of the beast to the truly genteel.


---
she happened
---
She reddened with shame and sadness.


---
she said,
---
The sharp reprimand was not lost upon her, and
---
in time to
 pass that for" fay she said"
---
she no longer spoke of
" dumbledores" but of" humble bees"
---
she grew"
---
when she had

---
she did not quaintly tell the servants next morning
---
she
 had been
---
she had suffered from indigestion
---
the fair
 girl could possibly have had of her own lapses-- really slight now, for

---
she read omnivorously
---
A gratuitous ordeal was in store for her in the
 matter of her handwriting.
---
She was passing the dining- room door one
 evening, and.
---
she
 had opened the door that she knew the Mayor was there in the company of
 a man with whom he transacted business
---
She brought forward blotting- book, paper, and ink, and.


---
She started the pen in an elephantine march across the sheet.
---
It was a
 splendid round, bold hand of her own conception, a style that would have
 stamped a woman as Minerva's own in more recent days.
---
proper young girls wrote
 ladies'-hand--
---
Her considerate disposition became a pitfall to her now.
---
She was.
---
it
 must be admitted, sometimes provokingly and unnecessarily willing to
 saddle herself with manual labours
---
She would go to the kitchen instead
 of ringing,"
---
She went down on
 her knees, shovel in hand,
---
moreover she would persistently thank the parlour- maid for everything,
 till one day,
---
the girl was gone from the room
---
she
 were
---
Elizabeth shrank so visibly at the exclamation, and.


---
The increasing frequency of the
 latter mood told her the sad news.
---
her appearance and manners became
 under the softening influences which she could now command, and in her
 wisdom
---
Sometimes she
 caught him.
---
she could
 hardly bear
---
she should
 excite his animosity
---
when she had taken his surname
---
Elizabeth had latterly
 been accustomed of an afternoon.
---
as she at once set

---
she obeyed.


---
Coming to the door she cried regardless of consequences,"
---
Then she must have had more charity than sense
---
she had n't.'
---
she could comfortably scratch her elbows
---
she was
---
sailed into the barn she had resolved
.
---
Elizabeth followed him to the house like a culprit; but
---
when
 she got inside
---
she could not see him.
---
did she see him again that
 day.


---
how she made use of those
 silent hours
---
She read and.

---
She began the study of Latin, incited by the Roman characteristics of
 the town she lived in.
---
If well- informed she would say to herself through the tears.


---
that would
 occasionally glide down her peachy cheeks
---
when she was fairly baffled by
 the portentous obscurity of many of these educational works
---
Thus she lived on, a dumb, deep- feeling, great- eyed creature, construed
 by not a single contiguous being; quenching with patient fortitude
 her incipient interest in Farfrae,.
---
she had
---
she had occupied with such
 zest
---
unsettled weather made her still more
 dependent upon indoor resources.
---
She seized on these days for her periodical visits to the spot
 where her mother lay buried-- the still- used burial- ground of the old
 Roman- British city.
---
Half- past ten in the morning was about her hour for seeking this spot-- a
 time when the town avenues were deserted as the avenues of Karnac.

---
There approaching her mother's grave she saw a solitary dark figure in
 the middle of the gravel- walk.
---
The personage was in mourning like herself,.

---
it was a lady much more beautifully dressed than she
---
her eyes were arrested by
 the artistic perfection of the lady's appearance
---
Her gait too had
 a flexuousness about it, which seemed to avoid angularity.
---
It was a
 revelation to Elizabeth that human beings could reach this stage of
 external development
---
she had never suspected it.
---
She felt.
---
all the
 freshness and grace to be stolen from herself on the instant by the
 neighbourhood of such a stranger
---
this was in face of the fact that
 Elizabeth could now have been writ handsome, while the young lady was
 simply pretty.


---
Had she been envious
---
she might have hated the woman; but
---
she did not
 do that
---
she allowed herself the pleasure of feeling fascinated.
---
She
 wondered.
---
this figure was no Casterbridge woman's, even if a book in her hand
 resembling a guide- book had not also suggested it
---
Elizabeth went to the tomb
 herself; beside it were two footprints distinct in the soil, signifying
 that the lady had stood there a long time.
---
She returned homeward,
,.


---
she had seen
---
she might have mused on a rainbow or the
 Northern Lights, a rare butterfly or a cameo
---
she had played the
 waiting- maid in the town of which he was Mayor to rankle in his mind yet
 more poisonously
---
she had
---
treacherous upstart-- that thus
 humiliated herself
---
She clapped her hand to her mouth, but too late.


---
The only way of getting a single pleasant thought to go to sleep upon
 after this was by recalling the lady she had seen that day, and hoping
 she might see her again.


---
you care for her
---
she was startled by the
 apparition of Farfrae, who passed outside the gate
---
she thought.

---
She fell into painful thought on her position, which ended with her
 saying quite loud,
---
I was dead with dear mother
---
she looked round, and.


---
a face was bending over her, the face of the young woman she had seen
 yesterday
---
she had been
 overheard
---
there was pleasure in her confusion
---
-- said Elizabeth,.


---
then the girl felt.


---
the young lady was sitting down beside her
---
That was your mother."
 
---
She waved her hand towards the tombstone.
---
Elizabeth looked up at her as
.
---
inquiring of herself there should be confidence
---
the girl decided
---
It was my mother," she said," my only friend."


---
I sighed the meek Elizabeth.
---
The lady seemed to warm towards her for that reply.
---
she said ingenuously.
---
mother died
---
Elizabeth- Jane looked wistfully at her questioner.
---
She found.
---
her
 questioner was looking at her
---
she
 said.
---
The lady assured her
---
she did want
---
that to know whereupon Elizabeth- Jane
 told the tale of her life.


---
she understood it,
---
Contrary to the girl's expectation her new friend was not shocked.
---
This
 cheered her; and
---
she thought of returning to that home
 in which she had been treated so roughly of late that her spirits fell
---
" how to return she murmured.
---
" said her friend gently.
---
What, not necessary to write ladies'-hand? cried the joyous Elizabeth.


---
Elizabeth expressed her astonishment.


---
her eyes shining at this prospect of a change from an
 unbearable position
---
Elizabeth joyfully assented; and
---
her ears
 had heard its name on a hundred occasions
---
Her mind dwelt upon nothing else but the stranger, and the house,
 and her own chance of living there, all the rest of the day.
---
she had occasion
---
when she learnt
---
what was a new discovery to
 herself
---
Elizabeth- Jane could however add a capping touch to information so new
 to her in the bulk.
---
she said,
---
Elizabeth thought.
---
she would like
---
She went up the street in that direction.


---
Elizabeth's eyes sought the upper rooms, and.
---
this woman of comparatively
 practised manner had made upon the studious girl's mind
---
The impression that was so deep that
 she enjoyed standing under an opposite archway merely to think that the
 charming lady was inside the confronting walls, and to wonder what
 she was doing.
---
Her admiration for the architecture of that front was
 entirely on account of the inmate it screened.
---
Elizabeth trotted through the open door in the dusk,
 but
---
she went quickly out again by
 another which stood open in the lofty wall of the back court.
---
she found herself in one of the little- used alleys of the town.

---
Looking round at the door, she saw older even than the house itself.
---
The appearance was so ghastly by the weakly
 lamp- glimmer that she could not bear to look at it-- the first unpleasant
 feature of her visit.


---
She turned but
---
she
 quickly retreated.
---
There being no other way out she stood behind a brick
 pier till the intruder
---
Had she watched.
---
she would have been surprised
---
She would have seen
---
Elizabeth- Jane clung so closely to her nook.
---
she discerned
 nothing of this
---
Elizabeth
 came out a second time into the alley, and.


---
Her plan was
---
she anxiously awaited his manner towards her.
---
She found.
---
She thought it undesirable and unnecessary to say anything at present
 about her destination to one who took so little interest in her.
---
" more cultivated and finished, and being less idle she answered,
 with hesitation."
---
She thanked him for this offer.


---
She now simply waited.


---
Elizabeth- Jane
 having now changed her orbit from one of gay independence to laborious
 self- help
---
her friend would only face it
---
She went to
 the boot- room where her pattens had hung ever since her apotheosis;
---
she
 had done in old times
---
cloak and umbrella she
 went off to the place of appointment--,.


---
was a corn- yard with its granary and
 barns-- the place wherein she had met Farfrae many months earlier.
---
she saw a figure.
---
Her presence so exceptionally substantiated the girl's utmost hopes.
---
she almost feared her good fortune
---
Here, in a churchyard old as civilization, in the worst of
 weathers, was a strange woman of curious fascinations never seen
 elsewhere: there might be some devilry about her presence.
---
However Elizabeth went on to the church tower,
---
thus she came to the wall.


---
The lady had such a cheerful aspect in the drizzle that Elizabeth forgot
 her fancy.
---
said the lady, a little of the whiteness of her teeth
 appearing with the word through the black fleece that protected her
 face,?"


---
said the girl,.


---
Both the women listened.


---
she said suddenly,"?"


---
Elizabeth- Jane shook her head."
---
On consideration she
 said sadly."
---
she passed them, and
---
she explained through the carriage
 window.


---
she said
 with spirit.


---
all her things had not yet been brought down
---
she had occupied it
---
Evidences of her care, of her endeavours for improvement were
 visible all around, in the form of books, sketches, maps, and little
 arrangements for tasteful effects.
---
she said, with deep concern.
---
She was in the fly--
---
whose manner had such
 charms for her."
---
she could
---
She repeated the words.
---
she signified to the flyman.





---
when Elizabeth- Jane was contemplating her stealthy
 reconnoitring excursion to the abode of the lady of her fancy
---
The self- repression had vanished from her mood
---
, the resignation of her
 previous communication she wrote with
 some of the natural lightness which had marked her in their early
 acquaintance.



---
I have come here in consequence of hearing of the death of your
 wife--!
---
Poor
 woman she seems, and
 though weak in intellect not an imbecile.
---
I am glad you acted fairly by
 her.
---
she was no more
---
Lucetta is related to her."
---
I must put her in her proper position,
 undoubtedly."


---
Elizabeth
 had
---
Miss Le Sueur had been the name under which he
 had known Lucetta-- or" Lucette," as she had called herself at that time.


---
Lucetta had not as yet settled in
---
her announce the
 address
---
Lucetta and Miss Templeman were one and
---
Lucetta was rather addicted
 to scribbling,.



---
hardly had Elizabeth gone
 away
---
she said,
---
you used, much more her affluence
---
I have taken her name-- as a means of escape
 from mine, and its wrongs
---
shall I call it?--practical joke( in all
 affection) of my getting her to live with me
---
my first meeting with
 her was purely an accident.
---
She is a dear, good girl, and

---
she thinks.
---
you have treated her with undue severity
---
As the result has
 been to bring her to me I am not disposed to upbraid you.--In haste,
 yours always,

" LUCETTA."



---
the sentiments to waste gathered around Lucetta.
---
She was
 plainly in a very coming- on disposition for marriage.
---
could a poor woman be, at that former time,?

---
no less than affection had brought her here.
---
The artful little woman! smiling( with reference to Lucetta's
 adroit and pleasant manoeuvre with Elizabeth- Jane).


---
To feel that to see Lucetta was with Henchard.
---
she would be happy to
 see him the next day
---
after all she plainly had not expected him, and
---
These
 cursed women!
---
she had been phlegmatically asked by an
 elderly woman.
---
She replied with
 great earnestness.

---
she would not think of giving that trouble, and

---
She was then conducted to the first floor on the landing, and.


---
She was probably some years older than
 Elizabeth, and.
---
The attitude had been so full of abandonment that she bounded up like a
 spring on hearing the door open.


---
it was Elizabeth, and
---
she lapsed into ease
---
Why, she said,.


---
She gathered up the pack of cards,.


---
she asked.


---
never mind she said.
---
Elizabeth drew up silently to the head of the sofa, but with obvious
 pleasure.
---
she was younger than her
 entertainer in manner and general vision
---
she seemed more of the sage.

---
Miss Templeman deposited herself on the sofa in her former flexuous
 position, and--.


---
" she said.
---
her countenance
 slightly falling
---
She looked thoughtfully.


---
Elizabeth's mind ran on acquirements to an almost morbid degree.
---
she said.
---
Lucetta's tongue had for a moment.
---
She had arrived
 at Casterbridge as a Bath lady, and
---
there were obvious reasons why
 Jersey should drop out of her life.
---
Elizabeth had tempted her, and
---
Lucetta's
 words went no further, and
---
she was so much upon her
 guard.

---
Not the least amusing of her safeguards was her resolute avoidance of a
 French word.
---
one by accident came to her tongue more readily than
 its English equivalent
---
She shirked it with the suddenness of the weak
 Apostle at the accusation,
---
Expectancy sat visibly upon Lucetta the next morning.
---
She dressed
 herself for Mr. Henchard, and
---
restlessly awaited his call before
 mid- day as she waited on through the afternoon.
---
she did not tell Elizabeth.


---
the person expected was the girl's
 stepfather
---
They sat in adjoining windows of the same room in Lucetta's great stone
 mansion,.
---
Elizabeth could see the crown of her stepfather's hat
 among the rest beneath, and.
---
Lucetta watched the same
 object with yet intenser interest
---
What trees said Lucetta,.


---
Elizabeth replied vaguely, for an incident.
---
She saw!"
 
---
said Lucetta.


---
said her companion, a quick red shooting over her face.


---
Lucetta looked hard at her."
---
Quite sure she said.


---
Again Lucetta looked out.
---
", she said.


---
she did not mention him.


---
she thought
---
not the visitor repeated her dressing
 with scrupulous care.
---
She got disheartened.
---
which had characterized her in their first acquaintance
---
she had

---
she said to
 Elizabeth- Jane quite coolly:".
---
She shook her head.
---
she said in a husky voice.


---
she believed
---
Elizabeth wishing to shield the man to be her father from
 any charge of unnatural dislike said" Yes."


---
Elizabeth nodded sadly.


---
Lucetta looked blank,.
---
said Lucetta, as soon as she could speak.


---
Elizabeth chimed in soothingly.

"
---
She could not finish the sentence, which was, naturally
---
Here she enumerated several commissions at
 sundry shops, which would occupy Elizabeth's time for the next hour or
 two, at least
---
Elizabeth hastily put on her things and.
---
why she
 wants to get rid of me to- day
---
she said sorrowfully.
---
she went
---
That
 her absence, rather than her services or instruction was in request,
.


---
she seemed, and
 difficult
---
She had not been gone ten minutes.
---
when one of Lucetta's servants was

---
my aunt's fortune has brought me more prominently before society?
---
her mistress gave directions that if a
 gentleman called he was to be admitted at once, and sat down to await
 results.


---
she arranged herself
 picturesquely in the chair; first this way
---
Next she flung herself on the couch in the
 cyma- recta curve which so became her, and
---
she decided
---
thus she remained.

---
Whereupon Lucetta forgetting her curve( for Nature was too strong
 for Art as yet).
---
In spite of the waning of
 passion the situation was an agitating one she had not seen Henchard
 since his( supposed) temporary parting from her in Jersey.


---
She could hear the servant showing the visitor into the room, shutting
 the door upon him, and leaving as if to go and look for her mistress.

---
Lucetta flung back the curtain with a nervous greeting.
---
her visitor might be
---
A conjecture that flashed through Lucetta's mind; but
---
when she was on the point of bursting
 out
---
Lucetta blushed, and said with a curious mixture of pout and
 laugh on her face--"O I've made a mistake!"


---
she said.


---
she
 was staying at Miss Templeman's
---
A little stimulated at not finding her
 ready and waiting-- so fanciful.


---
" she said.
---
Why should she have answered?


---
she did
---
she went on,
---
Lucetta regarded him with a critical interest.
---
She said,".


---
she added in hasty correction.
---
Lucetta did not add,.


---
she might have done
---
She shook her head.


---
Lucetta had said
---
she said.


---
The long
 bonnets of the women, like waggon- tilts, their cotton gowns and checked
 shawls, mixed with the carters' smockfrocks
---
The girl's lips quivered.
---
Thirty- five mile she murmured.
---
no, no-- she insisted,.
---
she turned her face to Lucetta's wall
---
" she said with strong feelings.
---
" O, she cried,.
---
she saw.
---
said Lucetta.
---
You are a-- a thriving woman; and
---
I am a very ambitious woman."


---
as replied she,.
---
she replied
---
better go she urged.
---
Certainly she said.
---
Lucetta almost laughed
---
she would quite have laughed-- but.
---
there was
 a little emotion going in her at the time
---
she said.

---
As she said eagerly,".
---
She had enkindled the young man's enthusiasm;.
---
Lucetta as a young girl would hardly have looked at a tradesman.
---
she had met with repulse from
 the society.
---
she had belonged, and
---
she had no great zest for
 renewing an attempt upon it now
---
Her heart longed for some ark into
 which.
---
she did not care so
 long as it was warm.


---
Lucetta at the window watched him.
---
She could see by his gait, and
---
she could see
 him no more.


---
when she had left the window
---
the
 waiting- maid tripped up.

"
---
Lucetta had reclined herself, and
---
she was looking dreamily through
 her fingers.
---
She did not answer at once, and
---
the maid repeated the
 information with the addition,"
---
she heard the door close.


---
Lucetta had come.
---
She had quickened them, and
---
now she was indifferent to
 the achievement.


---
she no longer felt strongly the necessity of getting rid of the girl for
 her stepfather's sake.
---
When the young woman came in
---
sweetly unconscious
 of the turn in the tide Lucetta went up to her, and
---
Her emotions rose,.





---
her malignant star had done
---
she had won from Donald Farfrae
---
Poor Elizabeth- Jane, little thinking what to
 blast the budding attentions was glad
 to hear Lucetta's words about remaining.


---
being a home raking view of
 the market- place which had as much attraction for her as for
 Lucetta.
---
Elizabeth and Lucetta were sitting at breakfast.
---
She called
 Elizabeth from her breakfast, and
---
Elizabeth saw one of a deep cherry
 colour, the other lighter-- a glove lying at the end of each sleeve, a
 bonnet at the top of each neck, and parasols across the gloves,
 Lucetta standing beside the suggested human figure in an attitude of
 contemplation.


---
" said Elizabeth,.


---
Lucetta was alternating the question whether this
 or that would suit best
---
" But said Lucetta.
---
she would be the
 cherry- coloured person at all hazards
---
Lucetta walked with it into the front room,.


---
The sun fell
 so flat on the houses and pavement opposite Lucetta's residence.
---
they poured their brightness into her rooms
---
women drew near it
---
how it struck
 Lucetta
---
, she said.


---
said Elizabeth.


---
Elizabeth left the window,.
---
She hardly knew."


---
she had done
 this till Lucetta,
---
she alone rivalled it in colour
---
She
 looked up, and
---
there was her stepfather.


---
she said.
---
said Lucetta.


---
reproachfully addressed to Lucetta.
---
She could
 not believe.
---
they had been uttered by her stepfather
---
Yet Lucetta seemed silent, and
---
both the women glanced towards the
 corn- drill.
---
she did not know what.
---
Lucetta next recognized him, and
---
more
 mistress of herself said archly,".


---
" But
 she added, on the strength
 of Henchard's information.


---
Lucetta seemed.
---
she
 asked of Farfrae.


---
she appertained to
---
Lucetta discerning
---
she had been in the way,
---
Lucetta explained the matter somewhat by saying
 when they were again in the sitting- room--


---
Lucetta was very kind towards Elizabeth that day.
---
Lucetta and Elizabeth looked out upon this,.
---
said Lucetta.


---
she continued,".
---
Lucetta seemed.
---
said Lucetta quickly.
---
when women get themselves in strange positions in the eyes of the world
 from no fault of their own
---
might not other women despise them?"


---
Lucetta winced again.
---
Her past was by no means secure from
 investigation, even in Casterbridge.
---
she could have
 wished.


---
when her eyes met Lucetta's as

---
A few days afterwards, she somehow knew.
---
who could
 read her
---
Lucetta passed on and
.


---
A seer's spirit took possession of Elizabeth,.
---
She followed Lucetta thus mentally--
---
his special
 look when meeting women,
---
this one was
 Lucetta
---
She depicted his impassioned manner
---
when Lucetta came noiselessly behind her and
---
she had pictured
---
as she could have sworn it.
---
Lucetta
 had a heightened luminousness in her eye over and above the advanced
 colour of her cheeks.


---
said Elizabeth demurely.


---
said Lucetta.
---
She knelt down on the hearth and.
---
she did not say.


---
when or how she had seen him or

---
she became restless;
---
That night she was feverish; and

---
she told her companion-- something which concerned a person in whom she was interested
 much.
---
she had something on her
 mind
---
Elizabeth was earnest to listen and sympathize.


---
"-- she said
 tentatively.


---
she
 did of him
---
She agreed.
---
she had been
---
she felt
---
she could never belong to another man, as a pure
 matter of conscience,
---
even she should wish to
---
she felt
 her life."


---
She suffered much on account of him
---
she-- my poor friend had seen a man
---
But in the interval-- she liked
 better than him.
---
Could she dismiss the
 first?"


---
she liked better
---
said Lucetta, looking pained at a boy who was swinging the town
 pump- handle.
---
she was forced
 into an equivocal position with the first man by an accident
---
she had

---
she had
---
Lucetta showed in her appealing tone how
 much she leant on Elizabeth's judgment.


---
Nevertheless Lucetta seemed.
---
she
 said languidly.


---
Well-- a little worn answered Elizabeth,.


---
she enabled Lucetta
---
Lucetta anxiously did
---
she observed after a while.


---
she said judicially.
---
Lucetta seemed.
---
She told Elizabeth- Jane no more of the past attachment she had
 roughly adumbrated as the experiences of a third person; and
---
Elizabeth,
 in spite of her philosophy sighed that
 night in bed at the thought.
---
her pretty rich Lucetta did not treat
 her to the full confidence of names and dates in her confessions
---
the" she" of Lucetta's story had not been beguiled.





---
rather Elizabeth
 sat invisible in the room
---
who could boast of a more
 Protean variety in her phases, moods, opinions
---
Lucetta had persisted in dragging her into the
 circle; but
---
she had remained like an awkward third point which that
 circle would not touch.


---
she had borne up under worse things, and
---
She stoically looked from her bedroom window, and."
---
she
 said at last,:"!"


---
she told me
---
the young woman for whom was, when now qualified with a slight inaccessibility and a more matured
 beauty
---
she seemed so transubstantiated
 by her change of position, and,, and.
---
She said something very polite
 about his being good enough to call.
---
Why I have called, Lucetta
---
; whenever in your opinion" she said evasively.


---
my
 poor ill- used Susan died, and, that after what had happened between us
---
she had surrounded herself
---
" Nor said she.
---
" said she, rather with an air
 of speaking ritual.
---
pouted Lucetta, with
 stormy eyes.

" Not at all!"
---
she answered,."
---
Knowing that the indulging in a foolish girl's passion for you with
 too little regard for correctness, that what you ought
---
Lucetta had the move; and
---
yet
 she was backward."
---
For the present let she said with some
 embarrassment.
---
She stopped; and
---
Lucetta's face became--.


---
a woman's face becomes
 when the man she loves rises upon her gaze like an apparition
---
" I should n't have thought it of women!"
---
Lucetta was so anxious to divert him from any suspicion of the
 truth
---
rising and shaking himself into activity while she asked him
---
she
 insisted upon paring one for him
---
when she dropped upon the sofa and

---
she cried
 passionately
---
Lucetta reasoned nothing:

---
she feared hard words from the people with whom she had been earlier
 associated
---
But she had no relatives and.


---
she called him, and
---
she experienced from the almost absolute obliviousness to
 her existence
---
half
 dissipated by her sense of its humourousness
---
When Lucetta had pricked
 her finger
---
she were dying
---
when she
 herself had been seriously sick or
---
But, she could not help.
---
she had done
---
As
 regarded Farfrae she thought, after honest reflection,.
---
was she beside Lucetta?--as one of the" meaner
 beauties of the night,".


---
She had learnt the lesson of renunciation, and.
---
her earthly career had taught her few book philosophies
---
her experience had consisted less in
 a series of pure disappointments than in a series of substitutions.

---
she had desired
---
what had been granted her
---
she had not desired
---
So
 she viewed with an approach to equanimity the now cancelled days when
 Donald had been her undeclared lover, and wondered what unwished- for
 thing Heaven might send her in place of him.





---
she made some excuse for not immediately granting him
 a second interview that he had desired.


---
as if do you remember my
 story of that second woman-- who suffered for her thoughtless intimacy
 with me?"


---
she wo n't marry
 me.
---
Now would you think of her--?"


---
ye owe her nothing more now
---
so that to
 hang near her seemed.
---
Her windows gleamed as

---
if her curtains seem.
---
when she offered him tea
---
she knew him
---
O yes, she declared
---
she could not help.


---
said Lucetta.


---
Lucetta was full of little fidgets and flutters,.
---
she had placed herself for his sake
---
Lucetta forming the
 third and haloed figure
---
More said Lucetta to Henchard and Farfrae equally,
.
---
How ridiculous of all three of them! said Elizabeth to herself.


---
More Lucetta had been unable to restrain her glance
 from flitting across into Farfrae's eyes like a bird to its nest.
---
She was so fully convinced that he was not the right man for
 the place that, at the risk of making Henchard angry, she expressed
 her apprehension to him when they met.
---
followed by angry voices outside Lucetta's house,.


---
which led her and

---
Lucetta and Elizabeth- Jane had by this time and.
---
The women had witnessed--
---
I pay my attentions to her, and for some time
---
Lucetta heard this low dialogue, or
---
not her white
 figure disappeared from her doorway inward, and
---
she had an engagement
 to go out
---
Candle- lights were flitting in and out of her bedroom, and
---
she was dressing for the appointment,
---
she had been waiting just inside for him
---
she instantly opened the door herself
---
Lucetta was saying gaily
---
she laughing
---
she added,"


---
Lucetta insisted on parting from Farfrae when they drew near the
 workpeople.
---
though to wait a few minutes she was inexorable, and.


---
her dress
---
she appeared.


---
she saw him
---
soon
 as she uttered a little cry, almost of terror.


---
she exclaimed, with a flushed face.
---
She sank into a chair, and.


---
she said through her
 hands,,.


---
She was silent.
---
she herself forgot for the moment
---
her partially justifying
 argument--
---
having discovered Henchard's infirmities of temper she
 had some excuse for not risking her happiness in his hands after once
 escaping them.
---
she could say
---
I was a poor girl
 then;
---
she cried passionately.


---
A look of resignation settled upon her.
---
she rang the bell, and.
---
Jane
 should be fetched from her room
---
The latter appeared, surprised in the
 midst of her lucubrations.
---
she saw Henchard
---
As soon as she went across
 to him dutifully.

" Elizabeth- Jane
---
turning to Lucetta:" will you not marry me?


---
No sooner had she given the promise.


---
she fell back in a fainting
 state
---
What dreadful thing drives her
---
when it is such a
 pain to her
---
I have lived with her, and."


---
she can not bear much
---
she said wildly.


---
Nobody, as far as I am concerned said Elizabeth firmly.


---
She agrees."


---
" But do n't dwell on it just now entreated Elizabeth,.


---
she promises
---
her limbs hanging like fluid,
---
What she said.

---
" Lucetta murmured with closed eyes,
 little thinking, however,
---
so unsuspicious was she,.


---
she was ready to burst
---
said Lucetta.
---
nothing of her was.


---
She was an
 old woman of mottled countenance, attired in a shawl of that nameless
 tertiary hue which comes, but.
---
that had been white in time so comparatively recent as still to
 contrast visibly with the rest of her clothes
---
The steeped aspect of the
 woman showed her.


---
She looked cursorily at Henchard and the second magistrate, and
---
she had reminded him
 indistinctly of somebody or something which passed from his mind as
 quickly as it had come
---
has she been doing?
---
She is charged, sir, with the offence of disorderly female and
 nuisance
---
Where did she do that?
---
Stubberd, with a suppressed gaze of victorious rectitude at the old
 woman continued:
---
She was wambling about quite
 dangerous to the thoroughfare and
---
to draw near she
 committed the nuisance, and."


---
did she say?"

"
---
She said,''
---
Put away that dee lantern, she says.
---
Says she,'?
---
finer- looking than a dee fool like
 thee, you son of a bee, dee me if, she says.


---
the
 old woman had appeared in court so many more times than the magistrates
 themselves,
---
she replied with a twinkle in her eye; and.


---
the woman
 continued.
---
I'm no
 better than she
---
to keep out of any temptation to treat her hard for
 her revenge I'll leave her to you."


---
the old
 furmity dealer had mysteriously hinted to the denizens of the lane in
 which she had been lodging since her arrival,
---
she knew a queer
 thing or two about their great local man Mr. Henchard,
---
she chose
---
said Lucetta
 to her servant.
---
She had risen late, and.


---
A woman has
 proved."


---
she now heard for the first time.


---
she dwelt upon the promise
 wrung from her the night before
---
she went out to the Ring and to other places,.
---
she saw Elizabeth- Jane
---
she told her
---
she had resolved
---
As soon as after her return
 indoors that to go away from home to the
 seaside for a few days-- to Port- Bredy Casterbridge was so gloomy.


---
she looked wan and disturbed,
---
Elizabeth seeing that encouraged her in
 the idea,.
---
a change would afford her relief
---
She could not help
.


---
the gloom to have come over Casterbridge
 in Lucetta's eyes might be partially owing to the fact that Farfrae was
 away from home
---
Elizabeth saw, and.
---
her friend depart for Port- Bredy
---
Is she come now
---
She returned this morning
---
she
 is not indoors.
---
She has gone for a walk along the turnpike- road to
 Port- Bredy.
---
She will be home by dusk."


---
Lucetta was bounding along the road to Port- Bredy.
---
just Elizabeth had announced
---
she had chosen for her afternoon
---
she had returned to Casterbridge.
---
Lucetta had at length.
---
here she stopped.


---
her was a barn-- the single building of any kind within her horizon.


---
She strained her eyes up the lessening road, but
---
She sighed one word--"Donald!" and
.


---
A single figure was approaching
 her-- Elizabeth- Jane's.


---
Lucetta seemed a little vexed.
---
she recognized her friend
---
Elizabeth's
 face as soon as shaped itself into
 affectionate lines while yet beyond speaking distance.
---
I suddenly
 thought meet you she said,.


---
Lucetta's reply was taken from her lips by an unexpected diversion.
---
A
 by- road on her right hand descended from the fields into the highway
 at the point where she stood, and down the track.


---
a bull was rambling
 uncertainly towards her and Elizabeth,
---
all these horned beasts, in travelling to
 and fro, sent women and children
---
Lucetta and Elizabeth regarded the animal in doubt.
---
the young women
 were really alarmed
---
the two helpless girls to run
 wildly
---
she said.


---
The girls doubled so adroitly that their pursuer was
 against the wall when the fugitives were already half way to the other
 end.
---
Lucetta was hysterical, and
---
she cried, as soon as she could speak.


---
she asked,
---
Where is Elizabeth?"


---
she slid down the face of the clover- stack to
 the floor.


---
when Lucetta, now much recovered,
---
she had dropped her muff in the barn
---
She thereupon hastened down again to the barn,
.


---
Elizabeth soon found the muff, such an article being by no means small
 at that time.
---
Coming out she paused,
.
---
she turned.


---
when she saw a green- and- black gig
---
how greatly Lucetta had been jeopardized
---
She has gone on with Mr. Henchard
---
you are sure she can get home?"


---
Your stepfather saved her?"


---
she guessed why.
---
she felt more
 embarrassed at sitting thus beside her past lover
---
The face
 of the woman was frequently turned back, but
---
said she.
---
she would fain have withdrawn it
---
said Lucetta.
---
"

" of what kind she asked with renewed misgiving.


---
even she may be so nearly my own as you
---
If she began, and.


---
the dryness of her lips was

---
she insisted desperately.


---
She was so alarmed at his silence that
 she murmured something about lending him sufficient money to tide over
 the perilous fortnight.


---
she explained, with tears in her eyes and quavers
 in her voice
---
She disappeared under the trees of the south.
---
Lucetta took no heed, but.





---
the good woman had been briefly informed by letter a few hours earlier
---
Moreover there was a
 convenience in Lucetta.
---
she was best in a position to break the news
 to the inmates, and give directions for her husband's accommodation
---
she calmed herself in
 readiness to receive Donald at High- Place Hall.
---
One supreme fact empowered her to this.
---
she had
---
she met him with a relieved gladness,.


---
she said
 earnestly,.
---
when she had finished
---
I did not tell her either;."


---
she might have heard of it in the town, and
---
She can hardly have heard of it.
---
But I'll go to her
 now.
---
She is so quiet and unassuming."


---
she would care to
---
said Lucetta eagerly.
---
I am sure she would like to.
---
Besides she has no other home."


---
she did not suspect the secret of
 her more reserved friend
---
you like with her
---
" speak to her said Lucetta.


---
When she got upstairs to Elizabeth- Jane's room
---
the latter had taken off
 her out- door things, and.
---
Lucetta found in a
 moment.


---
she had not yet learnt the news
---
" she said simply.
---
Lucetta uttered musingly at her.
---
What a lonely creature she
 presently said;".
---
You should get out, and
 gossip about as other women do, and
---
she was so glad,
---
said Lucetta, the difficulty of
 explaining herself satisfactorily to the pondering one beside her
 growing more apparent at each syllable.
---
She let out in jerky phrases a leading word or two of the
 story she had told.

"
---
O yes-- said Elizabeth drily,
.
---
how she wanted, but
---
she ought
---
The two lovers-- the old one and the new: to marry
 the second felt to marry the first so she neglected
 the better course.'"


---
she did n't follow evil exactly
---
O no; said Lucetta hastily.


---
I may say you"--answered Elizabeth,

---
she-- or as dropping the mask were in honour and conscience
---
Lucetta's blush at being seen through came and
---
she replied anxiously,
---
the wife returned, and

---
She is now dead, and
---
But, Elizabeth- Jane,
 I was absolved from
 all vows by the return of the other woman."


---
She had divined Man Number One.


---
she ought
---
she can
---
if
 even she were not the sinning party
---
Lucetta's countenance lost its sparkle."
---
to be a man she pleaded.
---
You must remain a single
 woman."


---
Her craving for correctness of procedure was, indeed, almost
 vicious.
---
Owing to her early troubles with regard to her mother a
 semblance of irregularity had terrors for her which those whose names
 are safeguarded from suspicion know nothing of.
---
she went on with a
 quivering lip in whose movement two passions shared.


---
" said Lucetta passionately.


---
Lucetta covered her eyes with her right hand,,.


---
she could plead no
 more
---
You are the woman he will adore, and
---
" O, my Elizabeth- Jane!" cried Lucetta distressfully.
---
Lucetta bowed.
---
She had recovered herself.


---
she said.
---
" Let the girl quickly replied,.


---
Lucetta departed, a vague uneasiness floating over
 her joy at seeing him quite at home there.
---
did she feel it
---
Not on account of her friend
 Elizabeth she had not the least suspicion; but on Henchard's alone.


---
she
 felt
---
she could not abide there
---
when she hastily put on her things and

---
knowing the ground she had found a suitable
 lodging, and.
---
she took off her pretty dress and
---
Returning and entering
 noiselessly arrayed herself in a plain
 one, packing up the other to keep as her best she would have.
---
She wrote a note to leave for Lucetta, who
 was closely shut up in the drawing- room with Farfrae; and
---
her boxes
 put into it
---
she trotted off down the street to her rooms
---
Here she sat down and.
---
The little
 annual sum settled on her by her stepfather.
---
her studies,, might serve
 her in still better.


---
The retort of the furmity- woman before had spread; and

---
when she saw
---
A bystander
 informed her, with some surprise at her ignorance,.
---
She felt quite
 tearful, and.


---
when she heard
---
that she wished
, but
---
when Farmer James Everdene of Weatherbury
 spoke
---
she might
---
Try as Elizabeth could never meet with him.
---
She believed
 in him still,; and and.


---
she wanted,
---
She wrote to him
---
She then went to his house-- the
 great house she had lived in so happily for a time-- with its front
 of dun brick, but

---
she was not his daughter
---
she went.


---
Elizabeth thought it odd that he had fixed on this spot to retire to,
 but.
---
even here her stepfather could not be seen.


---
By nobody-- at present: she was informed.


---
Afterwards she was passing by the corn- stores and hay- barns which had
 been the headquarters of his business.
---
She knew; but
---
she regarded the familiar
 gateway
---
she said,
"?"


---
I am sure my wife
 would not mind it at all
---
she devoted
 to studying such books as she could get hold of
---
Her lodgings being nearly opposite her stepfather's former residence
---
now Farfrae's she could see.
---
She
 avoided, but
---
While living on thus quietly she heard the news that Henchard had caught
 cold and was confined to his room-- possibly a result of standing about
 the meads in damp weather.
---
She went off to his house at once.
---
she remained.
---
She made the room more
 comfortable,.


---
she
 went away had
---
her visiting him
---
she was wise
---
Yes, she was wise in her generation!"
---
Elizabeth- Jane sat at her window one Sunday, and.
---
there she heard
 in the street below a conversation which introduced Henchard's name
---
She
 was wondering.

"
---
when a third person asked the question in her mind
---
his wife
           A widow plunged in grief
---
While Lucetta and Farfrae passed again, this time homeward,
.
---
where her
 stepfather was
---
She took
 his arm, and
---
she asked cautiously,, and.


---
" she said.


---
she went away;.


---
it was certainly her strong
 desire
---
She seemed
---
hence to waste an afternoon she remained indoors
.
---
her face being visible to
 Elizabeth- Jane from her window aloft
---
The latter however did not say
 to herself, but,
 full of her reading
---
,, that she cited Rosalind's exclamation:" Mistress
---
She kept her eye upon Henchard also.
---
" wimble for you instead of him, if, said she.
---
Her motive on going to the yard was.
---
her stepfather was a workman there
---
Meanwhile Lucetta, never having been informed
---
where she came suddenly upon Henchard
---
she breathed a dead- alive
" Good afternoon."


---
she faltered
---
Lucetta looked embarrassed, and
---
She glanced at him entreatingly
---
she said hastily;" half- past four."


---
she could do so
---
As soon as Lucetta left him,.
---
where she could be seen
---
she had been taken by
 surprise.
---
Will you said Lucetta, with as much bitterness?
---
she could put into
 a small communication
---
Lucetta took care.
---
She would
 rather have died.
---
Elizabeth- Jane, in her endeavours to prevent,
---
Arriving
 one day on this errand she found
---
her stepfather was measuring up
 clover- seed and rape- seed in the corn- stores on the top floor, and
---
she
 ascended to him.
---
When Elizabeth's head rose through the trap
---
she perceived.
---
her stepfather and stood just within it
 in conversation,, and Henchard
 a little way behind
---
Not to interrupt them she remained on the steps
 without raising her head any higher.
---
While waiting thus she saw-- or

---
she saw,.
---
she had a terror of feeling certain--
---
Elizabeth felt quite sick at heart on thinking of what this MIGHT have
 meant.
---
As soon as she mechanically took the tea to Henchard,
.
---
Reflecting she endeavoured.
---
she
 finally resolved.





---
accordingly she rose at five o'clock and.
---
She moved on to the bottom of Corn Street, and,
---
she heard the familiar
 bang of his door, and
---
She met him at
 the point where the last tree of the engirding avenue flanked the last
 house in the street.


---
She asked him.
"
---
But she said.
---
She now felt the difficulty of conveying to his mind the exact aspect
 of possibilities in her own.
---
she somehow began, and.
---
" she said with an effort,"
---
Every
 word cost her twice its length of pain.
---
she could see.
---
she went homeward,.
---
Elizabeth entered her
 lodging unhappily,.


---
she had done no good, and
---
herself
 appear foolish by her weak note of warning
---
Lucetta, light as a sylph ran
 forward and.


---
she cried playfully,."
---
, she noticed.
---
why
 she let
---
Any folk for me?"

" said Lucetta.
---
Lucetta had grown somewhat wan.
---
she replied.


---
What said Lucetta in alarm.
---
The
 words on her lips were" anything about me?"--but.

---
she did not utter them
---
She could not however suppress her agitation, and.


---
her eyes filled with
 tears
---
what mournfully remarked
 Lucetta.
---
onward Lucetta was very uneasy.
---
she had not been
 imprudence incarnate
---
If she would not have acted.
---
she did
---
when she met
 Henchard by accident a day or two later
---
she must again ask you
---
She explained."
---
how the death of her aunt had prevented her
---
she asked.


---
When she was gone
---
She has felt a bit weary; and."


---
What became of the poor woman
---
Luckily she married, and
---
she poured out on me
---
an angry woman will
 say
---
she
 can be the wife of any other man; and
---
who is yet no more to you than the
 first woman you meet in the street--
---
you will place me
 in her position
---
That in the event of your present wife's death is a consolation so far as it goes-- but
---
how she went on to me
---
Aphrodite ever
 spoke thus, whosesoever the personality she assumed.


---
Her name said blandly.

---
I did n't marry her, and
---
As I can scarcely do that in
 fairness to her."


---
why did n't you marry her?"
---
when your
 wife Susan died
---
to do so as in generosity bound she
 was not the woman for me."


---
She had already married another-- maybe?"


---
She had had
---
As Lucetta had retired early to her room because of
 fatigue.
---
She had, however,.
---
she wondered.
---
The dining- room was almost under her
 bed- room
---
she could hear.


---
She could
 think of nothing but.
---
she left
 the room, and.
---
she reached the lower flight
---
She stood.

---
she would make a friend of it in her misery
---
Rigid in
 this position fell successively upon her ear.
---
Is it quite fair to this
 young woman's memory?"


---
it
 would injure the woman."


---
Lucetta heard no more.


---
She went back to her bedroom in a semi- paralyzed state.
---
she could not undress, but.
---
Her suspense was
 terrible.
---
Had she confessed all to Donald in their early acquaintance
---
married her just the same unlikely
 as; but for her or would
 be fatal.


---
she could hear.
---
The spark in
 her eyes well- nigh went out.
---
Her
 gaze hung doubtful for a moment, then to her joyous amazement
---
she saw
.
---
She could hold out no longer, and
.


---
I may tell more about her some
 day."


---
Finding this she was much perplexed as to Henchard's motives in opening
 the matter at all
---
Lucetta remained in bed,.
---
, was yet too bold she dreaded lest in doing so he, like
 the rest of the world
---
the episode was rather her
 fault than her misfortune
---
She decided.
---
the only practicable weapon
 left her as a woman
---
Having laid her plan she rose, and
---
who
 kept her on these tenterhooks:--


---
she said, on closing up her appeal:"!"


---
she made a toilette which differed from.
---
she had ever
 attempted before
---
she was no
 novice
---
now she neglected this, and.
---
she had not slept all the previous night, and
---
this had produced
 upon her.
---
She selected-- as
 much from want of spirit as design-- her poorest, plainest and longest
 discarded attire.


---
To avoid the contingency of being recognized she veiled herself, and
.
---
The sun was resting on the hill like a
 drop of blood on an eyelid by the time she had got up the road opposite
 the amphitheatre, which she speedily entered.
---
She was not disappointed in the fearful hope with which she awaited him.

---
Lucetta waited breathlessly
---
she saw a change in his bearing
---
But: she could not think why.


---
Lucetta had unwittingly backed
 up her entreaty by the strongest argument she could have used outside
 words, with this man of moods, glooms, and superstitions
---
she had spoken a word
---
before her point was
.


---
" O, thank you," she said apprehensively.


---
She shook her head.
---
she asked,"?"


---
" she said.
---
I was a young woman
---
which had led to all her trouble
---
Moreover that thoughtless want of foresight
 remained with poor Lucetta still
---
she
 had come.
---
Such a woman was very small deer to hunt
---
she said with eager tremulousness;"
---
Returning from her appointment Lucetta saw a man waiting by the lamp
 nearest to her own door.
---
When she stopped
---
Lucetta would say a word in his favour to her
 husband
---
said Lucetta coldly.


---
Indeed she replied.
---
She steadily refused, and
---
she had vanished,
---
every scrap of Lucetta's writing that was
 here.
---
Another was the frequency of white aprons over dingy gowns among the
 women around the doorways.
---
moreover the industry and
 cleanliness which were belied by the postures
 and gaits of the women who wore it-- their knuckles being mostly on their
 hips( an attitude which lent them the aspect of two- handled mugs), and
 their shoulders against door- posts;.


---
there was a curious alacrity
 in the turn of each honest woman's head upon her neck and in the twirl
 of her honest eyes, at any noise
---
The landlady
 was a virtuous woman who years ago had been unjustly sent to gaol as
 an accessory to something or other after the fact.
---
She underwent her
 twelvemonth, and.


---
who apprehended her
---
when she winked her
 eye
---
Your wife swore false that time, Joe-- O, by Gad,."


---
she
 did--
---
she could n't see.
'
---
She then began.'
---
she'd scream again.
---
then she sware
---
the cock pheasant
 was one of her rearing,
---
the furmity- woman,, sat among
 the rest
---
Having travelled a great deal in her time she spoke with
 cosmopolitan largeness of idea.
---
It was she.


---
a woman should love one man so well, and
---
Lucetta had so earnestly hoped
---
now she's avowed herself to another man!"


---
So much the better for her said the aged furmity- woman.
---
I saved
 her from a real bad marriage, and
---
she's never been the one to thank me."


---
her went out at the back door and
---
she simpered.
---
its contents were reduced to ashes by Lucetta,
.
---
though that episode if known was not the less likely to
 operate fatally between herself and her husband.





---
"

" Carry out what?" said she, alarmed.


---
She was.
---
she said.


---
She could do nothing, and.
---
she got sight again of her
 stepfather
---
She thought; but no,
.
---
She waited in the crowd without.


---
the
 front seat was occupied by Lucetta, the Mayor's wife
---
She appeared so bright and
 pretty that.
---
gaily dressed women's
 eyes will too often do on such occasions
---
she was never tired of watching Donald,.
---
She was living his part rather than her own, and
 but Farfrae's that day.


---
Lucetta was
 ready to faint.
---
a strange phenomenon got the better of her fear
---
-- said Mrs. Blowbody, a lady of
 the neighbourhood who sat beside Lucetta.


---
observed Mrs.
 Bath, the physician's wife, a new- comer to the town through her recent
 marriage with the doctor.


---
" said Lucetta.


---
Now there's a
 better- looking woman."


---
she notices at all,
---
she's
 akin to that hontish fellow Henchard
---
she meant
---
diffused by the reading of Lucetta's letters at Peter's Finger
---
there was anything wrong about
 her afore
---
The proceedings had been brief-- too brief-- to Lucetta; but
---
The shake of the Royal hand still lingered
 in her fingers; and
---
she had overheard
---
her Scotchman was.


---
her deny
 him--
---
She has supplicated to me in her time;
 and
---
now her tongue wo n't own me nor her eyes!...
---
she shall be
 sorry.
---
she would have
---
she best might
---
Lucetta was sitting in the drawing- room
 alone.
---
she had not had
 for and,.
---
she preferred waiting for
 him by the firelight,
---
She was leaning back in the chair, in a more hopeful
 mood since her marriage.
---
she had enjoyed
---
she really seemed.


---
It did not
 greatly surprise her.

---
her attention was even more elevated than she.


---
who spoke from an upper window across the street
 to some other maid
---
She's facing the head, and
---
cried the disappointed first maid.


---
's the woman like?
---
just SHE dressed
---
when she sat in the front
 seat at the time the play- actors came to the Town Hall!
---
My-- why--'tis dressed as Lucetta started to her feet, and almost at the instant the door of the
 room
---
to see you she said breathlessly.
---
she crossed quickly to the window
 and.
---
Lucetta glided to her side.
---
she said peremporily, in a dry voice,.
---
she seized
 Elizabeth- Jane by the hand, and
---
not a word had been lost of the
 conversation without, which had thus proceeded:--

" Her neck is uncovered, and her hair in bands, and her back- comb in
 place
---
that she's got on a puce silk, and white stockings, and coloured
 shoes."


---
Lucetta held her
 by main force.


---
' Tis me she said, with a face pale as death.
---
The look of Elizabeth betrayed.


---
the rigid
 wildness of Lucetta's features was growing yet more rigid and wild with
 the meaning of the noise and laughter
---
she shrieked.
---
she cried.
---
She relinquished Lucetta's hands, and.
---
Lucetta herself saying recklessly"!" turned to the window,.
---
Elizabeth immediately followed, and
.
---
her to pull her in
---
Lucetta's eyes were straight upon
 the spectacle of the uncanny revel,.
---
She's me
---
she's me-- even to the parasol-- my green parasol!"
---
she stepped in
---
She stood motionless for
 one second-- then.


---
her fall the rude music of the skimmington
.
---
Elizabeth was only
 indirectly conscious of this
---
she had rung the bell, and.
---
She rang again and again, in vain
---
The shutters hastily pushed to by Elizabeth.
---
, were quite
 closed, Lucetta carried to her room, and
---
Elizabeth was undressing her
---
While she recovered
 consciousness; but.


---
she remembered
---
Elizabeth said.


---
a fit in the present state of her health means mischief.
---
said the parlour- maid;" to some
 place on the Budmouth Road.
---
her
 closing the oven- door
---
she said apologetically,".
---
Lucetta's life seemed at that moment
---
Though to depend upon
 her husband's return she being in great mental agony)
---
It is-- your wife!
---
She is ill.
---
Believe me, Farfrae I have come entirely on
 your own and your wife's account.
---
She is in danger.
---
his wife was
 with child
---
How is she
---
Her anxiety to see makes her
 fearfully restless.
---
they have killed her
---
she
 struck him in a new light, then, without further remark
---
she seemed
 to him as a pin- point of light.
---
she
 answered him from the stairs
---
She was not his own, yet,
---
Lucetta had been

---
when she had tried
---
which so oppressed her
---
those immediately around Lucetta
 would not venture
---
she informed him of the bare
 facts of her peculiar intimacy with the corn- merchant.
---
when she discovered reasons for
 fearing him( though in truth her inconsequent passion for another man
 at first sight had most to do with that abandonment)--her method of
 reconciling to her conscience a marriage with the second when she was
 in a measure committed to the first: to what extent she spoke of these
 things remained Farfrae's secret alone
---
her
 on each occasion of his inquiry at was a comfort to him
---
a servant raise her hand to the knocker,

---
She turned in some surprise at his presence, and.
---
Recognizing him she said,."





---
Because she will never hear it any more
---
the motions
 to be Elizabeth's
---
She came into his room,.

"
---
she asked."
---
She is-- dead!
---
To please him, and herself-- for his recent kindliness was winning a
 surprised gratitude from the lonely girl she did.
---
She could hear; but
---
her mind ran most strongly on Lucetta,
---
Presently she fell asleep.


---
Meanwhile her stepfather in the outer room had set the breakfast in
 readiness; but
---
she dozed
---
lit by her filial presence
---
Poor Susan was a strange
 experience."


---
She was a warm- hearted, home- spun woman.
---
She was not."


---
they call
 shrewd or sharp at all-- better she had been
---
She was not."


---
As in all likelihood she was simple- minded enough to think
 that the sale was in a way binding.
---
She was as guiltless o' wrong- doing
 in that particular as a saint in the clouds."


---
she had seen it as
 what it was
---
If she would never have left me.
---
how should she be

---
What advantages had she?
---
She could write her own
 name, and no more."


---
Well, to undeceive her said the sailor of former days.
---
she would be happier with me
---
She was fairly
 happy, and.
---
I never would have undeceived her till the day of her
 death
---
she had another, and
---
she and I and returned from America
---
when somebody had confided her history to
---
some while
 after the child-- she
 told her my claim to her.
---
she was never happy
 with me.
---
She pined and.
---
She said.
---
she must
 leave me, and
---
I left her
 at Falmouth, and.
---
twill be most
 kindness to her,
---
now she's taken against me,,
 for,'
---
her believe me
---
she supposes us both alive
---
while she'll be miserable
---
she thinks me dead
---
if she'll go back to him, and
---
as she went to you, and my daughter with
 her
---
Susan was dead
---
where is she?"


---
Where is she buried?"
---
When did she die?
---
she still believed herself

---
to be, so the sudden prospect of
 her loss had caused.
---
the young woman herself grew more jealously strong with each new hazard to which his
 claim to her was exposed.


---
who had been constantly in her presence
---
she would have vanished
---
there she was--.

" O father!"
---
she said.
---
Elizabeth- Jane's thoughts reverted to
 Lucetta.
---
Elizabeth would think of him for his deception
---
Then she arose, and
---
her heart is as warm towards me as mine is towards her
---
" At this moment she would live with me here in this humble cottage for the asking!
---
then she will scorn
 me!"


---
She came forward,,
.
---
she said,
---
Yet she had not divined their whole
 extremity.


---
she said.


---
She agreed willingly, and
---
She
 would gladly have talked of Lucetta, but.
---
she saw
---
She went, and.
---
Nothing she said.


---
She proceeded to the river.
---
she told him; but.
---
she saw something floating round and round
 there
---
she could not discern
---
She went back, and.
---
her head was close to the
 margin of the pool
---
She started up, and.


---
That performance of theirs killed her, but!"


---
she cried.

---
"

" said she.


---
Thus she assured him, and
---
The next morning to be as the effigy was discovered by a cowherd, and that of Lucetta a little
 higher up in the same stream.
---
Lucetta had been borne along the churchyard
 path
---
she had never lived
---
Elizabeth
 remained undisturbed in the belief of her relationship to Henchard, and

---
Lucetta had confessed everything to him before her
 death, and
---
that to claim her as a daughter there
 was little reason to suppose.
---
that revelation of her
 history, it
 was hard.


---
life with her would have been productive of
 further happiness
---
She took
.
---
when she sat
 with him in the evening
---
she was civil
 rather than affectionate; and;
---
She had her own way in everything now.
---
her word was law.


---
Yes; she said.


---
her to possess
---
she said quietly.
---
said the netted lion, anxious not to pique her in the least.


---
when she had cleared out of his then large and handsome house in
 Corn Street, in consequence of his dislike and harshness
---
She was quite
 unconscious of his attention, and
---
this was less fortunate than those
 young women
---
the Scotchman had once shown a tender interest
 in her, of a fleeting kind
---
she replied" No
---
she had

---
She did not enlighten him, and
---
her to shape thoughts unfavourable to their present
 friendly relations
---
her going and
---
it may at once be owned on her account
.
---
she was guilty of occasional conversations with Donald
---
the origin of her walks on the Budmouth
 Road
---
SHE do n't know that.
---
Elizabeth admitted, but
---
she did
---
she refrained from confessing why
 the sea attracted her.
---
her blood was a sailor's
---
" Thank you for those new books, Mr. Farfrae she added shyly.
---
If to be bereft of her it must be.
---
so Elizabeth
 would grow, and
---
then kiss her the girl
 looking quickly round.


---
Elizabeth to be his actual
 daughter, from his own assertion
---
Thus would
 the girl, be withdrawn from him by degrees
 through her husband's influence, and.


---
Had she lost her heart to any other man in the world than the one he had

---
then she would be her
 step- sire's own again.


---
who
 had looked upon herself as the only woman capable of making the
 merchant Councilman happy
---
whose first wife was no credit to him--?

---
is
 it for a young perusing woman that's her own mistress and
---
, she's a sensible piece for
 a partner, and
---
there's no faithful woman in high life
---
she's tender- inclined
---
tenderly smiled on by Elizabeth,
 and
---
she
 occupied
---
Elizabeth as has been said often took her
---
her to neglect her customary walk that day
---
she had chosen another road for variety's sake.
---
She might be here to- morrow, and
---
Elizabeth's strict nature would cause
 her for the first time, and
---
she cried," and?"


---
She looked down and
---
her tears fell silently.
---
It seemed to her.
---
She showed her devotion to Farfrae, however, by mastering her
 emotion and speaking out.


---
she said with difficult firmness.

---
to reconsider his
 determination she could not urge.
---
she did not know
---
what when
 she should learn, and
---
her other than as a step- parent
 she would refrain from despising him
---
when she knew
---
what done to keep her in ignorance she would refrain from hating him
---
Then she said at last,";
 and."


---
you'll do
 that, Izzy?--think of me when you are living as the wife of the richest,
 the foremost man in the town, and do n't let my sins, WHEN YOU KNOW THEM
 ALL, cause' ee to quite forget that though I loved' ee late I loved' ee
 well."


---
she sobbed.


---
She promised mechanically, in her agitation; and
---
She watched
---
alternately
 she could no longer see them
---
she did not know it
---
I had only got her with me
---
Elizabeth had breathed him a sigh,.
---
she had reached
 the first house she was met in her walk by Donald Farfrae.
---
She walked beside her lover, and.
---
Elizabeth entered
---
Moreover she had grown up under Newson's paternal care; and
---
she had grown up
---
I'll bring her round
---
I gather from Elizabeth
---
I said to myself, ay, a hundred times, when I tried
 to get a peep at her unknown to herself--'Depend upon it,' tis best that
 I should live on quiet for a few days like this till something turns up
 for the better.'
---
do the young woman say herself
 about it?
---
Elizabeth, my child come and.'

"
---
how many glasses
 of grog a woman that's not a drinking woman
---
Elizabeth lived here
---
Elizabeth now gave earnest heed to his story.

"
---
Elizabeth sighed.
---
my
 mother say so hundreds of times--
---
there was nobody to set before Elizabeth
 any extenuation of the absent one's deceit.
---
She was carrying the baby, and.
---
Then we
 crossed about here-- she so sad and weary, and I speaking to her hardly
 at all, because of my cursed pride and mortification at being poor.

---
she was standing
---
when she said her last words to me
 before going off with him
---
that I can hear their sound now, and the sound of
 her sobs:' O Mike!
---
His wronged wife had foiled
 them by a fraud so grandly simple as to be almost a virtue.
---
" But yes, John-- said a woman inside the waggon- tilt.
---
the woman's memory served her well
---
before she had said
---
she wished
---
She had
 regretted his decision to be absent--
---
She was one of those people
---
whom nothing
 surprises, and though to her, a total stranger, seemed odd she willingly volunteered.


---
she said.
---
she left him.
---
Just she got across the
 landing to the door of the best parlour
---
she
 returned.
---
she would wait-- Mr
---
who knew in spite of her maidenhood
---
She was in a
 dress of white silk or satin
---
the expression of her face
 was one of nervous pleasure rather than of gaiety.
---
the housekeeper had informed
 Elizabeth- Jane of the stranger who awaited her, and
---
she entered the room
 immediately.


---
she said,.


---
she seized her hand
---
She flushed up, and.
---
she said.
---
informed by
 her mother's letter
---
she could collect her thoughts
---
she saw him no more.





---
Elizabeth- Jane had grown accustomed to the novelty of her situation, and

---
Elizabeth- Jane was standing in the middle of her upstairs parlour,
."


---
whereon she
 was about to open her housekeeping campaign--
---
Nobody could tell her,.
---
The sadness of the incident had made an impression on her.

---
She had not been able to forget it for days, despite Farfrae's tender
 banter; and now.


---
she seized
 hold of the idea, at one feminine bound,.

---
She went out,.


---
she told him her solution of the bird- cage
 mystery; and
---
she might make her
 peace with him
---
she did not know it.
---
she needed
---
Having herself
 arrived at a promising haven from at least the grosser troubles of her
 life her object was.


---
She pondered the position, and
.


---
when she wer here
 below,
---
when she wer here
 below, and hardly any ashes from it at
 all; and taties, and such- like that were very needful to her
---
