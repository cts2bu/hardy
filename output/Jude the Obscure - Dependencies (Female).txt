 great fuel- house, and

she would house the piano till
 Mr. Phillotson
---
she seemed willing to give
 the instrument standing- room there. 
---
It came from an old woman who had emerged from her door towards the
 garden gate of a green- thatched cottage not far off. 
---
The old inhabitant was a tall,
 gaunt woman, who spoke tragically on the most trivial subject, and
. 
---
she
 continued, as the boy,,.

it was perhaps a very good plan of
 Miss or Mrs. Fawley's

 continued, in frowning pleasantry.

she was born in this
 place

My niece and her
 husband after get a house of their own for
 some year or more;

She was like

---
a little
 maid should know such changes

 little girl, and
---
she said,"?"


---
his aunt, suspending her breath
---
she opened upon him
 a lecture on how she would now have him all the spring upon her hands
. 
---
More angry with Jude for demeaning her by coming there than for
 dereliction of duty she rated him primarily from that point of view,
 and only secondarily from a moral one.


---
his great- aunt did not care much about him.




---
his own mother would n't know un sometimes
---
Why the very sons of the
 old women can talk in Latin-- not
 good Latin,."

"
---
she should discover his motive
---
his great- aunt was

some old woman crying," Two
 to- day, baker, and I return this stale one
---
she told him more yet
 of the romantic charms of the city of light and lore. 
---
I'll be her beloved son, in whom she shall be well
 pleased."


---
On the further side of the stream having three young women were kneeling, with buckets
 and platters beside them. 
---
She whom was a fine dark- eyed girl, not exactly
 handsome, but capable of passing as such at a little distance,
 despite some coarseness of skin and fibre. 
---
She had a round and
 prominent bosom, full lips, perfect teeth, and the rich complexion
 of a Cochin hen's egg. 
---
She was a complete and substantial female
 animal-- no more, no less; and
---
Perhaps she foresaw an opportunity
---
there was a momentary flash of intelligence, a dumb announcement of
 affinity_ in posse_ between herself and him,. 
---
She saw
.


---
a woman is singled out
 in such cases, for no reasoned purpose of further acquaintance, but

---
Springing to her feet she said:"."


---
the girl drew nearer to it
---
As she gave without Jude
 perceiving it, an adroit little suck to the interior of each of her
 cheeks in succession. 
---
she
 brought as by magic upon its smooth and rotund surface a perfect
 dimple, which she was able to retain there as long as she continued
 to smile
---
her to explain
---
why she had audaciously
 stopped him by this novel artillery instead of by hailing him
---
she slyly looking in another direction,
---
But, swayed herself backwards
 and forwards on her hand as; till,
 she turned her eyes critically upon him.


---
She nodded towards the
 fragment on the grass.


---
these girls are helping."


---
which was uttered very distinctly
 by Arabella's personality
---
she said piquantly.


---
She had spoken this without
 a smile, and
---
she had managed
---
She brightened with a little glow of triumph,.


---
Meanwhile the girl had joined her companions, and
---
she silently
 resumed her flicking and sousing of the chitterlings in the pellucid
 stream.


---
" Catched un, my dear?" laconically asked the girl called Anny.


---
regretfully murmured Arabella.


---
She would wait
 indoors, poor girl, and.

---
There was a something in her, too,. 
---
which lay between the village and the isolated
 house of Arabella in the dip beyond the upland
---
just Arabella came downstairs
 in radiant walking attire
---
she whispered to Jude.


---
Arabella looked so handsome amid her untidy surroundings.


---
said Arabella. 
---
that they found themselves on the scene,--the
 distance being altogether about half- a- dozen miles from Marygreen,
 and three from Arabella's
---
Arabella said. 
---
she would like some tea, and
---
she met the serious and
 tender gaze of her lover-- the low and triumphant laugh of a careless
 woman who sees
---
she is winning her game.


---
" said Arabella.


---
Arabella tasted it. 
---
she said.


---
She mentioned three or four
 ingredients that she detected in the liquor beyond malt and hops,
 much to Jude's surprise.


---
Nevertheless she returned to the beer and
---
She wondered, but
---
She took it, thoroughly, up to the shoulder. 
---
her right it rested in its place
---
she adding to herself:" Rather mild!"

 How fast I have become
---
the only way of getting to Arabella's was by going up the
 incline, and dipping again into her valley on the right. 
---
Arabella tittered lightly.


---
she inclined her head upon his shoulder. 
---
she had desired,
---
" if she said gently.


---
how she was
---
Thus they slowly went towards her home. 
---
She asked him and. 
---
she had been out alone in the dark
---
a simple, quiet
 woman without features or character; and bidding them all good night
 plunged with a sense of relief into the track over the down
---
But Arabella soon re asserted her
 sway in his soul. 
---
It was better to love a woman than to be a
 graduate, or a parson
---
his aunt had gone to bed, and
---
Arabella made them public among all her friends
 and acquaintances.


---
She was
 not there now, and
---
" the embroidery of imagination upon the stuff of
 nature so depicted her past presence. 
---
a half later Arabella came along the same way with her
 two companions of the Saturday. 
---
She passed unheedingly.


---
she related almost word for word some of his
 tenderest speeches. 
---
Arabella replied in a curiously low, hungry tone of
 latent sensuousness:! 
---
if Arabella remained
---
she
 asked.


---
The third girl looked at the second. "
---
She DON'T
---
clear she do n't!
---
I should say a sojer, or sailor, or commercial gent from
 the towns, or any of them that be slippery with poor women! 
---
Arabella's companions looked at each other, and. 
---
Then one went up close to Arabella, and,

---
A woman had
---
Lots of girls do it; or
---
Arabella pursued her way in silent thought. 
---
" she
 whispered; but not to them.




---
a glimpse of Arabella
 should not come into the reckoning of regular appointments
---
top
 of her head moving quickly hither and thither over the garden hedge
---
she
 was endeavouring unassisted
---
she had set open
---
The lines of her countenance changed from the
 rigidity of business to the softness of love. 
---
when she saw Jude, and

---
she bent her eyes languishingly upon him
---
she cried,
---
if said she. 
---
She rushed in full pursuit out of the garden, Jude alongside her,
. 
---
She gave him her now hot hand with apparent willingness,
 and
---
she remarked. 
---
" cried Arabella. 
---
she swerved aside and
.


---
She lay supine, and. 
---
she went on
---
her form heaving
 and
---
her face flushed,
---
her full red lips
 parted, and a fine dew of perspiration on her skin
---
Oh, said Arabella. 
---
" said she.


---
She gently pulled him down beside her.


---
she said crossly,.


---
She rolled round her face,
---
Sha n't! she said.


---
She kept her two lips resentfully together, and
---
she slackened her pace and
---
Arabella went in,
.


---
I took too much liberty with her, somehow
---
the interior of Arabella's home was, as usual,
 the scene of a grand weekly cooking, the preparation of the special
 Sunday dinner. 
---
her mother and Arabella herself were

---
A neighbour passed on her way home from
 morning service at the nearest church, and.


---
Donn engaged at
 the window with the razor,
---
She spoke playfully to Arabella
---
Arabella merely threw a look of consciousness into her face without
 raising her eyes.


---
When the gossip had departed Arabella
---
Arabella met and. 
---
said Arabella, who had attended to the sounds.


---
When they arrived at her house
---
Wait a moment said she. 
---
She tried the handle of the door and
.


---
Ah-- she added. 
---
searching behind the
 scraper she found the key and. 
---
", she asked lightly. 
---
She took off her jacket and hat,
 and
---
Do n't touch me, she said softly. 
---
She began.


---
said her lover.


---
She put her hand into her bosom and. 
---
Having exhibited it to him she put it back,

---
a woman to want
---
She had turned round her chair, and,.


---
she said defiantly,"!" 
---
She had quickly
 withdrawn the egg a second time; but. 
---
she had put it back as quickly,
---
Her face flushed; and.


---
she had jumped up too. 
---
she cried.


---
Her lover followed her. 
---
she withdrew
---
her to have rushed
 up the stairs, whither Jude rushed at her heels
---
Arabella seemed dissatisfied
---
she
 was always imagining, and.


---
she met the itinerant Vilbert. 
---
She knew the quack well, and
---
she began. 
---
Arabella had been gloomy, but. 
---
she
 had grown brighter
---
she kept an appointment with Jude,
 who seemed sad.


---
Arabella began. 
---
she
 said. 
---
she looked into his face with streaming eyes.


---
Arabella how can say that, my dear! 
---
Arabella was not worth a great deal as a specimen of womankind
---
Arabella's parents being among them
---
Fawley's aunt being a baker
---
she made him a bride- cake,; and
---
Arabella took some slices,_
---
His wife was absolutely useless in
---
her
 keep a pig
---
Arabella however felt
---
,, that she had gained a husband
---
Arabella wore
---
A long tail of
 hair, which twisted up in an enormous knob at the back
 of her head was deliberately unfastened,.


---
However perhaps there
 was no great sin in a woman, and
---
A new- made wife can usually manage. 
---
There is a certain piquancy about her situation, and
 her manner to her acquaintance at the sense of it, which carries off
 the gloom of facts, and. 
---
when she
 met Anny her former friend, whom she had not seen since the wedding
---
Nevertheless it was with a little uneasiness that Arabella approached
 the time when in the natural course of things she would have to
 reveal that the alarm she had raised had been without foundation.

---
When she came into
 the room he was between sleeping and waking, and.


---
she sat
---
she
 was amusing herself by artificially producing in each cheek the
 dimple, a curious accomplishment of which
---
she was
 mistress,
---
She turned and. "
---
she
 said. 
---
they improve a
 woman-- particularly a married woman, and
---
she lost, for that matter,? 
---
Jude's wife came downstairs.


---
Is she asked.


---
She went out, and. 
---
A robin peered down at the preparations
 from the nearest tree, and,,. 
---
Arabella had joined
 her husband, and
---
Arabella opened the sty- door, and
---
while Arabella bound him down,.


---
she cried. 
---
she cried,"! 
---
she
 had desired
---
Make! said Arabella. 
---
she slipped it into the gash, and. 
---
she said.


---
; said she. 
---
she cried, thoroughly in a passion. 
---
, to know she said scornfully. 
---
' for glane said Arabella. 
---
said Arabella,.

---
his wife had called him, a tender- hearted fool
---
who had been Arabella's
 companions
---
One of the girls was talking to a friend in a she d, himself. 
---
' twas I put her up to it! '
---
If she than
 I."

"' Tis my belief she knew..."


---
when she told
 him
---
she was
---
had Arabella been put up to by this woman? 
---
Arabella however was busy
 melting down lard from fat of the deceased pig,. 
---
she had been out
 on a jaunt all day, and
---
Arabella was very talkative, and. 
---
she wanted some money
---
Seeing the book sticking out of
 his pocket she added.


---
Her defensive manner collapsed. 
---
she said,
. 
---
Every woman has a right to do such as that. 
---
She might attached
 to it for the man, or,
---
so far she should not go and."


---
she resumed operations about ten
 o'clock; and.


---
she warmed
---
As she saw some of
 Jude's dear ancient classics on a table where they ought not to have
 been laid. 
---
she cried
 petulantly; and.


---
she began
---
her fingers consequently
 left very perceptible imprints on the book- covers. 
---
She continued
 deliberately,
 incensed beyond bearing,. 
---
her leave
 off
---
it rolled about her ears.


---
" Let! she said.


---
She hesitated. 
---
she repeated.

" Promise!"


---
she crossed the room to the door,
 out of which
---
she went with a set face, and into the highway. 
---
Here
 she began,. 
---
she
 now presented, bonnetless,. 
---
her dishevelled hair blowing in the wind
---
her bodice apart her sleeves rolled above her elbows for her work,
 and
---
" See she cried. 
---
not she did
---
she asked.

---
she said no more,
 and. 
---
she was tired
---
Aunt did
---
She raised her ancient eyes under the rim of the by- gone bonnet that
 she always wore. 
---
" she said.


---
she must have been a fool to open up that
---
Your
 mother soon afterwards died
---
she drowned herself, in short, and
---
she so disliked. 
---
she went
 away to London with her little maid
---
how Arabella would receive him in his
 new aspect
---
she would know
---
she came back, and
---
she had not visited the
 house
---
Then there
 came a letter from her.


---
she had gone tired of him
---
she frankly admitted. 
---
she did not care for the sort of life he
 led. 
---
She further went on. 
---
her parents had
---
she proposed. 
---
A woman of her sort would have more chance over there
 than in this stupid country.


---
she wished,
---
she might sell them with the rest, or as
 many of them as she should choose
---
She must have thrown it in with the
 rest of her property at the auction.


---
Arabella and her parents had

---
she had said. 
---
she was bent on going
---
I have
 a wife. 
---
she
 was
---
His grand- aunt had gruffly replied on further
 questioning the old woman.


---
she was his cousin
 Sue Bridehead, of the inimical branch of the family; and
---
the girl lived in
 Christminster,
---
she did not know where, or
---
she was doing
---
His aunt would not give him the photograph. 
---
One of the spectres() was now apostrophizing her thus:

" Beautiful city!
---
Her ineffable charm
 keeps ever calling us to the true goal of all of us, to the ideal, to
 perfection."


---
she's
 here all the time!... and my old schoolmaster, too
---
She did so, with a request, however,. 
---
She seemed and
. 
---
the girl remained at Christminster. 
---
To
 make her still more objectionable she was an artist or designer of
 some sort in what was called an ecclesiastical warehouse, which was
 a perfect seed- bed of idolatry, and.
---
she was
---
Miss Drusilla
 was of her date, Evangelical.)


---
As this
 news of Sue's probable opinions did not much influence him one way or
 the other, but
---
the clue to her whereabouts was decidedly interesting.

---
to be kept entirely by women
---
she was so
 pretty that he could not believe it possible that she should belong
 to him. 
---
Then she spoke to one of the two older women behind the
 counter; and
---
was she doing?

---
her lay a piece of zinc, cut to
 the shape of a scroll three or four feet long, and. 
---
she was designing or
 illuminating, in characters of Church text
---
Her presence here was now. 
---
her skill in
 work of this sort having
---
she was engaged
---
It would have been easy to speak to her there and then,
 but
---
She had used him roughly, but
---
she had

---
her being powerless to control him

---
She seemed
 so dainty beside himself in his rough working- jacket and dusty
 trousers. 
---
she had

---
which had resulted in his becoming
 enchained to one of her own sex whom she would certainly not admire
---
she was there
---
she
 remained more or less an ideal character, about whose form he began
 to weave curious and fantastic day- dreams.


---
She looked right into his face with
 liquid, untranslatable eyes,. 
---
She more observed his presence than that of
 the dust- motes which his manipulations raised into the sunbeams.


---
she was a country- girl at bottom, a latter
 girlhood of some years in London, and a womanhood here
---
When she was gone
---
she was not a large
 figure,
---
she was light and slight, of the type dubbed elegant
---
There was nothing statuesque in her
---
She was mobile, living, yet
---
a painter might
 not have called her handsome or beautiful. 
---
she was

---
She was quite a long way removed from the rusticity
 that was his. 
---
there were
 crushing reasons why he should not and could not think of her in any
 other
---
later on to be invited to tea by, the emotion spent on her being
 rigorously that of a kinsman and well- wisher. 
---
So would she be to him
 a kindly star, an elevating power, a companion in Anglican worship,
 a tender friend.




---
she frequently attended there
---
She did not come, and. 
---
she came at all
---
if she would approach the
 building along the eastern side of the great green quadrangle from
 which
---
she appeared as
 one of the figures walking along under the college walls, and
---
Sue was among them
---
The girl for whom to nourish an extraordinary
 tenderness was at this time; and
---
She was probably a frequenter of this place, and
---
she must be by occupation and habit
---
she had left her seat and
---
She did not look towards him, and
---
she was half- way down the broad path.

---
She was such a stranger
---
I, a man with a wife must not know her!" 
---
Still
 Sue WAS his own kin, and the fact of his having a wife,
---
even she was not in evidence in this hemisphere
---
the
 pretty, liquid- eyed, light- footed young woman, Sue Bridehead had an
 afternoon's holiday, and
---
she assisted but
---
She went along for
 a mile or two. 
---
she came to much higher ground than that of the
 city she had left behind her
---
Sue paused there,
---
she was
 reading,
---
she beheld a
 foreigner with black hair and a sallow face,
---
They were in the main reduced copies of ancient marbles, and
 comprised divinities of a very different character from those the
 girl was accustomed to see portrayed, among them being a Venus of
 standard pattern, a Diana, and, of the other sex, Apollo, Bacchus,
 and Mars. 
---
the figures were many yards away from her
---
she could discern their contours with luminous
 distinctness; and
---
being almost in a line between herself and the
 church towers of the city they awoke in her an oddly foreign and
 contrasting set of ideas by comparison. 
---
She shook her head.


---
" How much she said,.


---
she should have them for ten shillings
---
" said Sue. 
---
She offered considerably less,
 and to her surprise
---
She clasped them as treasures.


---
she began. 
---
she should do with them
---
they were in her possession, and so very naked
---
she trembled at her enterprise.

---
When she handled them the white pipeclay
---
openly an idea came
 to her, and,
---
After carrying them along a little way pulling some huge burdock leaves, parsley, and other
 rank growths from the hedge she wrapped up her burden as well as she
 could in these,.


---
she carried
---
Well, she
 said. 
---
she was still in a trembling state, and.


---
she had not bought the figures
---
Occasionally peeping inside the leaves to see that not broken she entered with her heathen load into the most Christian
 city in the country by an obscure street and
---
she was attached. 
---
Her purchases were taken straight up to her
 own chamber, and but.


---
she at once attempted;
---
that was
 her very own property
---
she wrapped
 them in large sheets of brown paper, and
---
, dressed almost like an abbess a dab at Ritual, as become
 one of her business, and mentioned,. 
---
She was the daughter of a clergyman in reduced
 circumstances, and
---
she boldly avoided penury by taking over a little
 shop of church requisites and developing it to its present creditable
 proportions. 
---
She wore a cross and beads, and.


---
She now came,.


---
the girl did not
 respond for a moment
---
she asked,
.


---
said Sue.


---
She tore a little hole, about as big as a wafer,
 in the brown paper, and. "
---
when she was sure of being
 undisturbed
---
she unrobed the divinities in comfort. 
---
Placing the pair
 of figures on the chest of drawers she withdrew to the bed,. 
---
she had taken from her box, which Miss Fontover knew
 nothing of
---
she read the chapter
 dealing with the reign of Julian the Apostate. 
---
Occasionally she
 looked up at the statuettes, which appeared strange and out of place,
 and,

---
as if she at length jumped up and
!



---
she read to the end. 
---
Presently she put out the candles,
 undressed, and.


---
She was of an age which usually sleeps soundly, yet
---
she
 kept, and
---
she opened her eyes
---
that Sue was tossing and

---
the service was half over that one of the women

---
Surrounded by her influence all day,
---
she frequented
---
she was almost an ideality to him still
---
her would be
---
Sue to be the loved one
 of a man who was licensed by the laws of his country to love Arabella
 and none other unto his life's end
---
she is exceptionally bright; and
---
whatever Sue's virtues, talents, or
 ecclesiastical saturation it was certain.


---
a young girl entered the stone- mason's
 yard with some hesitation, and,.


---
That's a nice girl
---
is she?
---
Why she's
 the daughter of that clever chap Bridehead who did all the wrought
 ironwork at St. Silas' ten years ago, and. 
---
she's come back here
---
Meanwhile the young woman had knocked at the office door and. 
---
she was out of sight. 
---
Sue's was of the most artless and natural kind. 
---
She addressed him
 as her dear cousin Jude
---
she had only just learnt by the merest
 accident that he was living in Christminster, and
---
her know
---
she said,. 
---
she was thrown much upon herself, and
---
now there was every probability of her soon
 going away,.


---
she was going away.

---
Arabella had been met in the same way, unfortunately, and
---
it might
 not seem respectable to a dear girl like Sue. 
---
Before she called out to him:


---
she showed signs of closing in,,
---
" Oh-- she said with the freedom of a friend. 
---
She looked him
 up and down curiously,.


---
to know me more than she added.


---
She agreed, and
---
the rays fell on the nervous little face and vivacious
 dark eyes and hair of Sue, on the earnest features of her cousin,
 and on the schoolmaster's own maturer face and figure,
---
She was so
 vibrant that everything she did seemed to have its source in feeling.

---
her walk ahead so fast that he could
 hardly keep up with her
---
her sensitiveness on some points
 was such that it might have been misread as vanity. 
---
the gloom of the walk home
 lay not in the night overhead, but in the thought of her departure.

"
---
She laughed.


---
Well-- she continued. 
---
I with her; and it
 is best to go."


---
She broke some statuary of mine."


---
She found it in my room, and!"


---
she
 threw it on the floor and
---
it was not according
 to her taste, and
---
" Too Catholic- Apostolic for her I suppose? 
---
No doubt she called them
 popish images and."


---
she did n't do that. 
---
She saw the matter quite
 differently."


---
It was for quite some other reason that she did n't like my
 patron- saints. 
---
her see
---
she has

---
she has,
---
has she? 
---
Does she really think of
 adopting teaching as a profession?"


---
she was disposed
---
her time would
 be wasted
---
she had agreed
---
Sue had
 been taken as stop- gap. 
---
Having taught for
 some two years in London, she had abandoned. 
---
she had only been with him three or four
 weeks
---
her cross the road to the school
---
she did cross
---
At twenty minutes to nine a light hat tossed
 on her head; and
---
which had nothing to do with her skill as a teacher
---
Sue
 remained governing her class at the other end of the room, all day
 under his eye
---
She certainly was an excellent teacher.


---
some article in the Code made it necessary that a respectable,
 elderly woman should be present at these lessons when the teacher and
 the taught were of different sexes. 
---
Sue lodged
---
where Mrs. Hawes, the widow at whose house
, occupied herself with sewing
---
she figured
---
-- that she would involuntarily glance up with a little inquiring smile
 at him,. 
---
she assumed
---
Perhaps she
 knew.


---
said Sue to the schoolmaster,. 
---
she stood with him a
 little in the background,"
---
she said,". 
---
my dear girl consider!"


---
She was silent,. 
---
she was easily repressed; and
---
she cried in her quick, light voice.

---
Your cousin is so terribly clever that she criticizes it
 unmercifully
---
She is
 quite sceptical as to its correctness."


---
what is
 called a clever girl
---
She impulsively
 seized his hand, and. 
---
her voice revealing a tremor which she herself
 felt to be absurdly uncalled for by sarcasm so gentle
---
She had.

how the hearts of the twain went out to her at
 this momentary revelation of feeling, and

she was

when there would be no lessons to
 give to Sue, and

Her Majesty's school- inspector was at that time; and

Sue's class was at the further end of the room, and

her back was
 towards the entrance

her teaching some half- minute

she became aware
 of his presence

She turned, and.

The effect upon her timidity was such that she uttered a
 cry of fright.

 falling from faintness

She soon recovered herself, and;

she was
 so white that Phillotson took her into his room, and gave her some
 brandy to bring her round.

 latter was holding the umbrella over her head, and

VI


 Jude's old and embittered aunt lay unwell at Marygreen, and
---
His aunt was now unable to leave her bed, and
---
she was comfortably supplied with
 necessaries and more,
---
a widow of the same village living with her and
 ministering to her wants. 
---
Was Sue born here?"


---
She was-- in this room. 
---
Now you've been seeing her!"
---
" said the harsh old woman. 
---
Have you gossiped with her?"


---
She was brought up by her father; and
---
she'll look with no favour upon a working chap
 like you-- a townish girl by now. 
---
she's become
---
I never cared much
 about her. 
---
she was too often, with
 her tight- strained nerves
---
I've smacked her for her
 impertinence
---
Why when she was walking into the pond with
 her shoes and stockings off, and her petticoats
---
, one day pulled above her
 knees, afore she said:'!

---
She was a little child then."


---
She was twelve if a day."


---
now she's older
---
she's of a thoughtful,
 quivering, tender nature, and as sensitive as--"

" Jude!"
---
Do n't you be a fool
 about her!"


---
she's gone to
 the other side of the world, and
---
' ee to give her
---
she's
 townish and wanton
---
she began a commentary on past years,
---
She described
---
an odd little
 maid Sue had been
---
what how she appeared on the platform, the
 smallest of them all," in her little white frock, and shoes, and pink
 sash"
---
how she recited" Excelsior,
---
she would knit her
 little brows and glare round tragically, and
---
She'd bring up the nasty carrion bird that clear
---
she stood there in her little sash and
 things
---
The neighbour told also of Sue's accomplishments in other kinds:

"
---
She was not exactly a tomboy
---
she could do things that
 only boys do, as a rule. 
---
her hit in and and up the back slide without stopping
---
her little curls blowing, one of
 a file of twenty moving along against the sky like shapes painted
 on glass
---
then they'd cheer her, and
---
Sue's little figure had so glorified
 itself;
---
After all she had only known
 a little part of the miserable struggle in which he had been engaged
 thus unequipped, poor, and unforeseeing.


---
the schoolmaster had been since
 blest with the consolation of sweet Sue,.


---
She laid it down. 
---
The spirit of Sue seemed. 
---
the maid stood
 still, Jude's voice echoing sonorously into the inner parlour, where
 the landlord was dozing, and bringing him out to see what was going
 on. 
---
She must have recognized his voice, for the light
---
Sue appeared with a candle in her hand.


---
she led him indoors, and
---
She asked him, but
---
she would come down early
 in the morning and
---
that get him some breakfast she bade him good- night
 and.


---
She knew the worst of him-- the very worst. 
---
She would soon be coming down, and
---
she had said,
---
she had hung
 it
---
attended by the woman who lived with her
---
her speaking of him
---
My aunt has mentioned
 you more than once. 
---
I bitterly regret the
 Church, and the loss of my chance of being her ordained minister."


---
there was no other girl, O bridegroom,
     like her!"--SAPPHO( H. T. Wharton).



---
was created
 by a letter from Sue,
---
She evidently
 wrote with anxiety, and. 
---
more
 than she had passed some sort of examination for a Queen's
 Scholarship, and
---
she had chosen
---
Sue was even less than formerly as proper
---
Sue had gone to the Melchester
 Normal School. 
---
She had acquiesced so readily that he wished he had not
 proposed it-- she evidently did not much care about him, though she
 had never once reproached him for his strange conduct in coming to
 her that night, and his silent disappearance. 
---
she ever
 said a word about her relations with Mr. Phillotson.


---
Suddenly however quite a passionate letter arrived from Sue.

---
She was quite lonely and miserable
---
she told him. 
---
She hated the
 place she was in
---
She felt utterly friendless
---
she would only be able to
 see him at limited times
---
; she found
 herself in being strict to a degree. 
---
she wished.


---
she had never listened to
 him
---
as how near the girl with the kindling glance,
 daringly soft at times-- something like that of the girls seen in engravings from paintings of the Spanish school. 
---
She was
 here-- actually in this Close-- in one of the houses confronting this
 very west façade.


---
she came
---
she had been here such a short while
---
Though she was not. 
---
All her bounding manner was gone
---
her curves of
 motion had become subdued lines. 
---
She wore a murrey- coloured gown with a little lace collar. 
---
formerly she had worn
---
Her hair, which according to the
 custom of the day was now twisted up tightly, and
---
she had altogether
 the air of a woman.


---
She had come forward prettily, but
---
she had hardly
 expected him,
---
Sue regarded him as a lover, or
---
she knew the worst of him,
---
Sue came out into the town with him, and
---
then she confessed,
 with something of shame,
---
she was dreadfully hungry
---
she most desired in the world
---
She told him about the school
---
the mixed character of her fellow- students gathered
 together from all parts of the diocese, and. 
---
how she had
---
she did not tell
---
, she looked up
 and.


---
they were the
 fingers of a glove she was purchasing
---
, she said.


---
She had touched the subject at last. 
---
Her ever- sensitive lip began, and.


---
her to say
---
" said she, with the perverseness that was
 part of her. 
---
Sue regarded him
 passively without moving.


---
she said with an air of no emotion
 whatever. 
---
she
 probably knew, and
---
She was something of a riddle to him, and
---
Though she answered, a remnant of vexation still in her voice.

---
she cried. 
---
Her reproach had taken that shape, then, and not the shape of words.

---
Nobody stared at Sue,. 
---
she was
---
which had no connection
 with her real life or her real self
---
said she.


---
Sue paused patiently beside
 him, and
---
When she had thoroughly estimated him at this
---
she would move on and
. 
---
her
 cousin deeply interested her, as one
---
that would intensify the sense of her
 day's freedom,
---
Sue, inclined for any adventure readily agreed; and away
---
Sue seemed, and
---
that his mother's and his pointing to a little dip ahead from which a
 faint blue smoke arose,
---
admitted by an old woman
 without a single tooth, to whom
---
You can bide here over the night-- can't'em, Mother?

---
then she can go into
 Mother's room, and
---
I rather like this said Sue,. 
---
An urban miss is.
---
She looked severe disagreement, and.


---
she was again
---
the gables of the old building in which to
 be immured rose before Sue's eyes
---
walked to the
 Close, and she looked a little scared. 
---
she murmured.


---
she
 said quickly,
---
She passed
 in,.




---
The seventy young women, of ages varying in the main from nineteen to
 one- and- twenty, were older,. 
---
Sue Bridehead had not come in at closing- time
---
She went out with her young man
---
She'll have it hot."


---
when she does come
---
She said,.


---
to be
 effectual in saving our souls said the head girl of the year,
 drily.


---
there had occurred
 a lamentable seduction of one of the pupils who had made the same
 statement in order to gain meetings with her lover
---
Sue's being pronounced three
 times sonorously by Miss Traceley without eliciting an answer
---
every girl's thought was,? 
---
Where is Sue Bridehead
---
which remained empty, and
 at her little dressing- table at the foot,
---
Sue's table had a moderate
 show,.


---
Who did she ever say?"
---
One-- the middle- aged man said a student in the next bed--"is the
 schoolmaster she served under-- Mr.
---
She has never told his name."


---
Was it either of these two who came for her?"


---
they fell asleep the
 girls indulged in conjectures about Sue, and
---
she had carried on in London and
---
she came
 here, some of the more restless ones getting out of bed and looking
 from the mullioned windows at the vast west front of the cathedral
 opposite, and the spire rising behind it
---
they glanced into Sue's nook,
. 
---
When accordingly Sue came into the dormitory.

---
hastily tidy
 herself looking flushed and tired she went to her cubicle in
 silence,
---
she did not follow them
 into the dining- hall to breakfast, and
---
she had
 been severely reprimanded, and
---
dictating her
 subject the girls in the class sat with folded arms.


---
We are willing to take her word
---
said the head girl.


---
the mistress left
 the room to inquire from her superiors what was to be done.


---
Presently the pupils as heard exclamations
 from the first- year's girls in an adjoining classroom, and
---
Sue Bridehead had got out of the back window of the
 room in which she had been confined,
---
How she had managed.


---
she was
. 
---
She must have walked through the river!
---
Or drownded herself said the porter.


---
The mind of the matron was horrified-- not so much at the possible
 death of Sue as at the possible half- column detailing that event in
 all the newspapers,.


---
some
 little boot- tracks were discerned in the mud, which left no doubt
 that the too excitable girl had waded through a depth of water
 reaching nearly to her shoulders-- for this.

---
Sue had not brought disgrace upon the school by drowning herself
---
she was gone
---
that contained Sue
---
she could enter easily enough
---
she
 had fled to him in her trouble
---
she appeared in
 the light of his lamp
---
she
 was clammy as a marine deity, and
---
her clothes clung to her like
 the robes upon the figures in the Parthenon frieze
---
she said through her chattering teeth. 
---
She crossed to his little grate and very little fire, but
---
the
 water dripped from her
---
she moved
---
the idea of drying herself was
 absurd. 
---
She had begun the explanation in her
 usual slightly independent tones, but
---
she had finished
---
the
 thin pink lips trembled, and.

" Dear Sue!
---
she could hardly refrain from crying
---
I'll ask her."


---
her know,
---
were her wet garments.
---
She blushed.


---
They are only a woman's
 clothes-- sexless cloth and linen... 
---
She
 gasped a little, but, and.


---
She then began; but
---
her voice faltered,

---
her head nodded, and. 
---
she ceased
---
She was in a sound sleep. 
---
she should have caught a chill which might
 permanently injure her
---
a warm flush now rosed
 her hitherto blue cheeks, and
---
her hanging hand was no
 longer cold
---
When she had descended
---
Suddenly she said," Jude!"


---
she said,.


---
When she had sat
---
the supper fortified her somewhat, and.


---
when she
 had had some tea and
---
again she was bright and cheerful
---
she seemed
 preternaturally wakeful afterwards,
---
she said,. 
---
she asked, with a touch
 of raillery.

"
---
Only you do n't talk quite like a girl--
---
she said thoughtfully,". 
---
most women are taught
---
she invites him
---
she says by a look
'
---
she said, a contralto note of
 tragedy coming suddenly into her silvery voice. 
---
she, with an ostensible sneer could hear
---
she was

---
some women would not have remained.
---
Better women would not. 
---
she seemed.


---
she suddenly asked, in
 a voice of such extraordinary tenderness
---
who had just told her story so lightly
---
she was treating
 him cruelly
---
Her very
 helplessness seemed.


---
she answered,"
---
And"

" I whatever except said Sue Bridehead earnestly. 
---
she turned her face away.


---
" she said, perverse still at his differing
 from her. 
---
she
 turned the conversation to some generalizations about the offending
 university
---
she would not enlighten
 him.

"
---
" But she murmured.


---
she added,
.

---
she replied, in the tone of a child who was going to be good for ever
 after, turning her back upon him accordingly. 
---
she
 took it up, and.


---
," she come back to her will you let like the one I made
 for myself at Christminster?"


---
she said,
---
she glanced
 into the pages of Solomon's Song
---
her introducing personal feeling
 into mere argument
---
she cried,. 
---
Whither is, O thou fairest among women
---
The Church
 professeth her faith_
---
YOU are fairest among women to me
---
Sue replied,. 
---
her voice changing
 to its softest note of severity
---
she went on
 soothingly,
---
She
 looked up trustfully, and
---
her voice seemed.


---
Sue was so
 dear!... 
---
she
 seemed
---
If, as to be able to do so easily of his she would
 make
---
She
 was nearer to him than any other woman he had ever met, and
---
she
 fell asleep again
---
her clothes were dry
---
Her chair being a far more comfortable
 one
---
his she still slept on inside his great- coat,. 
---
her
 touching her on the shoulder
---
she was dressed as usual.


---
" she asked. 
---
She has a school
 near Shaston, about eighteen miles from here-- and
---
Sue still
 seemed sorry for her rashness, and. 
---
she had not rebelled
---
she would let as soon as she
 got
---
Jude she said. 
---
waving her pretty hand she vanished away
---
came a letter from her,
 which, with her usual promptitude, she had written. 
---
directly she had

---
She told him of her safe arrival and
 comfortable quarters, and then added:--


   
---
I felt what a cruel and
    ungrateful woman I was to say it, and. 
---
You do forgive your
    thoughtless friend for her cruelty? and.



---
which should have
 rendered a long residence with a female friend quite unnecessary for
 Sue
---
she would
 write again
---
she was ill from her
 immersion
---
A little girl opened the door. "
---
Miss Bridehead is up- stairs
---
she
 said. 
---
will you walk up to her?"


---
Is she ill?
---
her lying in a little bed in a room a dozen feet
 square
---
she answered. 
---
She did not answer directly. 
---
she went on. 
---
She turned her eyes doubtfully towards him, and.


---
she might forgive him
---
she said shortly,. 
---
her face changing a little
---
" she said decisively.


---
Sue's kind hostess now returned from church, and
---
she was rather unreasonable,
---
she must
 have written almost immediately
---
you would like?--Your repentant

    SUE
---
when she came
---
she chose
---
she would not marry him offhand
---
the young woman said.
---
she had received
 his considerate letter, and
---
she desired
---
the
 school being such an awkward place for callers, and because of her
 strong wish)
---
who loved her
---
There
 was another of her as a young woman, her dark eyes and hair. 
---
that lay behind her lighter moods
---
Sue had never written a line to her suitor on the subject,
. 
---
she
 had promised; and
---
Sue as saw, moreover, that to speak to him felt no little embarrassment;.


---
her escaping
 from the training school
---
her coming to me?"


---
Sue had irretrievably committed herself with him
---
were I in a position to marry her, or someone, and
---
What was simply that he loved her.

"
---
which
 led to her rustication
---
Sue
 appeared
---
she had

---
to get my things from the college she said-- an
 observation which he was expected to take as an answer, though it was
 not one. 
---
she, smiling with quick
 curiosity
---
she knew his sentiment towards her Jude
---
she continued:
---
Could she possibly know of that morning performance
 of his with Arabella;? 
---
she did not
---
which merely led up to the
 information that he had married a wife some years earlier
---
his wife was living still
---
her countenance had time to
 change
---
Almost before she hurried out the words,

"
---
she withdrew it. 
---
She was his comrade,
 friend, unconscious sweetheart no longer; and
---
she burst out. 
---
" that-- all the time-- oh, she said,.


---
It was a question which in the circumstances Sue did not choose to
 answer.


---
she-- your wife is-- a very pretty woman,
---
even she's
 wicked
---
-- if she asked quickly.


---
She's pretty enough, as far as that goes."


---
I have never seen her for
 years... 
---
she's sure
---
How strange of you to stay apart from her like this! said Sue,
 her trembling lip and lumpy throat belying her irony. 
---
When she saw
---
she softened, and
---
once Sue was as miserable as he, in her attempts to keep herself free
 from emotion, and her less than half- success.


---
she said,. 
---
she showed. 
---
herself recovered
---
less had she
 appeared anyhow
---
she did appear; essentially large- minded and
 generous on reflection, despite a previous exercise of those narrow
 womanly humours on impulse that were necessary to give her sex
---
" she said,.

---
" that wanted to be your
 wife, if said Sue, with a gentle
 seriousness which did not reveal her mind. 
---
Her being able to talk learnedly showed.


---
she was mistress of
 herself again; and
---
she had almost regained her
 vivacious glance, her reciprocity of tone, her gay manner, and her
 second- thought attitude of critical largeness towards others of her
 age and sex
---
She said."


---
she said with nervous
 lightness. 
---
yet could the poor girl do?
---
Sue was not a very practical or calculating person;
 and
---
secret
 had moved her,
---
Sue had, been
 placed in an awkward corner. 
---
Sue had written
---
Sue also thanked him. 
---
who had been one cause of Sue's unpleasant
 experience as for the sake of room
---
Then Sue wrote.


---
she should come into residence on the
 following Saturday,
---
She arrived by the ten o'clock train on the day aforesaid,,
---
to meet her at the station, that she said(. 
---
this were
 her true reason)
---
the
 remembrance of their mutual sensitiveness at emotional crises might have weighed with her in this
---
she had taken possession of her apartment.


---
She lived in the same house with him, but on a different floor, and

---
each other little an occasional supper being the only meal
 they took together, when Sue's manner was something like that of a
 scared child
---
she felt
---
she did not look pale or ill
---
Sue and her cousin
 had breakfast together for the first and last time during this
 curious interval; in his room-- the parlour-- which he had hired for
 the period of Sue's residence. 
---
women do
---
,, she bustled about.


---
she said suddenly.


---
She talked incessantly,. 
---
she dreaded his indulgence in
 reflection, and
---
the
 curious trick in Sue's nature of tempting Providence at critical
 times she took his arm.


---
they walked through the muddy street-- a
 thing she had never done before in her life-- and on turning the
 corner they found themselves close to a grey perpendicular church
 with a low- pitched roof-- the church of St. Thomas
---
Indeed she exclaimed with curiosity. 
---
She does not realize
---
Sue still held Jude's arm,. 
---
almost she
 loved him
---
Cruelly sweet indeed she had been to him that morning;
 but...
---
to do things like this she said in the delicate voice of an
 epicure in emotions, which left no doubt that she spoke the truth.


---
she said regretfully. 
---
she blinked away an
 access of eye moisture
---
she continued
 humbly; and
---
whose train had arrived sooner than Sue expected. 
---
she withdrew her
 hand, and
---
she smiling candidly
---
she had gone too far.


---
she accordingly
 did
---
said Sue,".


---
requesting
 her lover not to be a long time she departed with the schoolmaster
---
she could almost be seen.


---
she was

---
the couple were
 judged, nobody supposing
 Sue to have been a recent pupil at the training school.


---
" she said. 
---
she obeyed.


---
How could Sue have had the temerity?

---
Women were different from men in such matters. 
---
was Sue simply so perverse
 that she wilfully gave herself and him pain for the odd and mournful
 luxury of practising long- suffering in her own person, and of being
 touched with tender pity for him at having made him practise it? 
---
her face was nervously set, and
---
it seemed, from her knowledge of
 what her cousin must feel,
---
rather however as she need not have had there at all,
 than from self- consideration. 
---
Possibly she would go on.


---
she looked back;
 and
---
there was a frightened light in her eyes. 
---
Sue
 had acted with such unusual foolishness
---
as to plunge into she knew
 not what for the sake of asserting her independence of him, of
 retaliating on him for his secrecy? 
---
Perhaps Sue was thus venturesome
 with men.


---
she was childishly ignorant of that side of their
 natures which wore out women's hearts and lives
---
When her foot was on the carriage- step
---
she turned round,. 
---
she had forgotten something
---
she said,. 
---
She had found it, and. 
---
She looked into his eyes with her own tearful ones, and
---
her
 lips suddenly parted. 
---
she were going
---
she
 went on; and.




---
she had meant
---
she had really left her handkerchief behind
---
she had miserably wished
---
she could not bring herself
---
she would come back
---
She could not
 possibly go home with Phillotson
---
Her
 actions were always unpredictable:? 
---
why should she not come
---
she did not come.


---
whither she and Phillotson had gone for their holiday
---
looked out of
 the window, and pictured her through the evening journey to London,
 their rattling
 along through the damp night to their hotel as that showed its
 position rather than its shape, and
---
It was a new
 beginning of Sue's history. 
---
If, see
 her child-- hers solely there would be comfort in it!
---
his old
 aunt was dangerously ill at Marygreen, which intelligence
---
There was every possibility of her
 lingering on for weeks or months, though little likelihood. 
---
she might like
---
she had occupied when
---
The chair, leaning over her ecclesiastical
 scrolls a hog- hair brush in her hand had

---
she were dead, and
---
nobody had been
 found capable of succeeding her in that artistic pursuit. 
---
when she turned her face for a moment to the glass
---
she had come on to his compartment
---
If she would have seen him.

---
she did not being presided over by the maiden on the other
 side. 
---
Abby was in a black gown, with white linen cuffs and a broad
 white collar, and her figure, more developed than formerly,.

---
was
 accentuated by a bunch of daffodils that she wore on her left bosom
---
she served
---
she cried gaily. "
---
She served the liqueur from one of the lovely bottles and.


---
Not a sound said she.


---
She handed the change over the counter, in taking. 
---
Arabella now seemed. 
---
she served
---
Arabella did not recognize him for a moment. 
---
She started
---
she
 spoke.


---
She idly allowed. 
---
her fingers to rest on the
 pull of the beer- engine
---
she inspected him critically
---
her hands were smaller and whiter than when he had lived with
 her, and
---
she wore an
 ornamental ring set with what seemed to be real sapphires-- which they
 were, indeed, and were much admired as such by the young men who
 frequented the bar.


---
to go into them she replied evasively. 
---
Arabella was
. 
---
she said,
. 
---
Arabella's word was absolutely
 untrustworthy
---
there might be some truth in her
 implication
---
she had not wished, and
---
Having to meet Arabella here it was impossible. 
---
Arabella was perhaps an intended intervention to punish him for his
 unauthorized love. 
---
each having a pink
 flush on her cheek
---
she would find him outside the door
---
when she came away
---
" But she said with great
 good humour. 
---
She drew a couple of liqueur glasses of brandy; and

---
she had evidently, from her countenance, already taken in
 enough alcohol either by drinking or,
---
though more probably she had breathed for so many hours
---
she finished hers
 quickly. 
---
she came, in a thick jacket and a hat with a black
 feather. 
---
she said," and. 
---
none in particular answered,; the probable disappointment of Sue that he was not there when
 she arrived, and the missed pleasure of her company on the long and
 lonely climb by starlight up the hills to Marygreen. 
---
My aunt is on her deathbed
---
There was something particularly uncongenial in the idea of Arabella,
. 
---
She speedily returned, and
---
Having, like Jude, made rather a
 hasty toilet to catch the train Arabella looked a little frowsy,
 and
---
her face was very far from possessing the animation which had
 characterized it at the bar the night before. 
---
she found. 
---
she still had half an hour to spare
---
she was due at the bar
---
What? said she.


---
Arabella spoke somewhat hurriedly for her. 
---
her disappear in the direction of
 the hotel
---
she lay asleep at dawn,
 which set upon his motionless face a look as of one accurst
---
Sue stood
 like a vision before him--.


---
her strained eyes speaking reproachful
 inquiry
---
" Oh, Jude-- she said in quick,
 uneven accents not far from a sob. 
---
Then she flushed.


---
she observed
 his thought that they had not met since her marriage
---
she glanced at him with furtive solicitude
---
Aunt was a trifle better
---
I sat up with her, and
---
she said,
,!"


---
she appeared to him now, in his tender

---
her spirit could be seen
---
yet she was Phillotson's. 
---
How she had

---
such how she lived as such,
---
how my aunt is by this time
---
she knew
---
Though she did not turn
 to him, but.

"
---
she quickly returned.


---
she entreated.

---
She had asked the question in perfect innocence,.

---
That Sue was not, but. 
---
she had been
---
Yet she seemed unaltered
---
Sue talked; but
---
she still kept the conversation
 from herself
---
she said. 
---
she is hardly conscious
---
There was something in her face which belied
 her late assuring words, so strictly proper and so lifelessly spoken
 that they might have been taken from a list of model speeches in" The
 Wife's Guide to Conduct." 
---
she was unhappy
---
she had not been
---
she had hardly known in her life
---
She reproached him by a glance.


---
Sue put on a look of being offended,, so far as I can see!"


---
she answered," Nor has
 husbandom you
---
That's the house my wife and

---
I brought her
 home to that house."


---
She looked at it. "
---
She closed her lips in retortive silence, and
---
she glanced at him
---
Sue felt
---
she had done
---
who
 lifted her hands deprecatingly
---
She's downstairs,
!"
---
she got, and

---
nothing could turn her. 
---
there indeed by the fireplace sat the old woman, wrapped
 in blankets, and. 
---
she
 said in a hollow voice:

"
---
she added,. 
---
most women marry, Aunt
---
Sue jumped up and. 
---
She means well, but."


---
said Sue,. 
---
I do n't
 mind her roughness one bit."


---
she says
---
she said hastily. 
---
she had really been going
---
her aunt took
 rather kindly to Sue,.

---
not many young women newly
 married
---
Sue prepared
---
She would not let him. 
---
she
 looked at him prohibitively
---
She bent down and.

---
She waved her hand and.


---
She's right! 
---
Before
 there arrived a letter
 from Arabella. 
---
Arabella informed him. 
---
she had been surprised by an
 affectionate letter from her Australian husband, formerly manager of
 the hotel in Sydney
---
her to join him in conducting the business, which was likely
 to be a very thriving one, the house being situated in an excellent,
 densely populated, gin- drinking neighbourhood, and
---
where she was
---
As that implored her to
 tell him, as as her engagement in Christminster was only temporary she had

---
She could not help,.

---
she belonged to him more than to Jude
---
she had properly married
 him, and
---
she bore him no ill- will, and.




---
she had a chance of improving her
 circumstances and leading a genteel life
---
insulted Nature sometimes vindicated her rights" in such
 circumstances
---
even she had not told him of her
 Sydney husband till afterwards
---
she despised herself for having
 and
---
she liked

---
her manner was
---
Since Sue as delayed her reply till Thursday before Good Friday,. 
---
when she said
---
she was now assistant- teacher in
 her husband's school
---
where there were more wanton
 women than honest wives and maids
---
girls in white
 pinafores over red and blue frocks appeared. 
---
Sue had gone out into the town at the
 heels of the last scholar
---
the girl sweeping the floor having informed him
---
it was still the girl with
 the broom
---
Do n't stop said Sue. 
---
Sue sat down, and
---
She was evidently
; and, and
---
when she
 had finished
---
she said, in a voice"
---
She played on and suddenly.


---
She uttered a forced little laugh.

---
she relinquished his quickly
---
How funny she said. 
---
" said Sue. 
---
she flung open
 before going out, and
---
when she returned,
---
the door of which followed by the maiden with
 tea
---
she said,.


---
she talked of
 him to Phillotson
---
she went on.

---
she read clearly
---
she always did
---
She regarded him curiously.


---
she coaxed. 
---
The
_ tremolo_ in her voice caused.


---
her to break off
---
she suddenly jumped up; and
---
she said,. 
---
Some women's love of being loved is
 insatiable;
---
As she touched
 his fingers but lightly when he went out now. 
---
when she jumped on a form
 and
---
to catch your train,
 Jude she asked.


---
Now that so that she seemed.


---
she had

---
she continued, still in the tone of one
 brimful of feeling,"
---
a woman tossed about, all alone, with aberrant
 passions, and
---
She stretched out her hand
 and. 
---
She had said.


---
she lived over the way at Old- Grove
 Place, a house which he soon discovered from her description of its
 antiquity
---
Sue evidently just come in
---
the latter being
 crossed by huge moulded beams only a little way above her head. 
---
The centuries did, indeed, ponderously
 overhang a young wife who passed her time here.


---
She had opened a rosewood work- box, and.

---
she pressed it against her
 bosom, and
---
she had not obscured the windows she came
 forward to do so, candle in hand
---
her to see
 Jude without
---
She closed the shutters, and
---
was she looking at?
---
she had others
---
However if woman did. 
---
she was wrong in her view
---
Your aunt is sinking
---
she is dead,
---
She would n't have knowed' ee. 
---
She lay like a doll wi' glass eyes
---
It was absolutely necessary to
 communicate with Sue, though. 
---
Aunt Drusilla is dead,
---
Sue would come
---
She had not written, and
---
she would come
---
she would not
---
she looked so slender to- day. 
---
she might be crushed in the intensity of a too passionate
 embrace--
---
Two- thirds of the way
 up her head suddenly took a solicitous poise, and
---
she
 had at that moment
---
Her face soon began a pensive
 smile, which lasted till, having descended a little way
---
she began with nervous quickness
---
however Sue did

---
Sue saw it not at all, or,.


---
herself to feel it
---
Drusilla was put
 into the new ground, quite away from her ancestors. 
---
Sue and Jude
 had gone side by side to the grave, and
---
She was opposed to marriage, from first to last
---
murmured
 Sue.


---
She said. 
---
Sue was silent. 
---
she said with a tentative
 tremor," for a husband or wife? 
---
Presently she went on
---
Would n't the woman be very
 bad- natured
---
she did n't like
---
she had a
 personal feeling against it-- a physical objection-- a fastidiousness,
 or whatever it may be called-- although she might respect and be
 grateful to him
---
she to try
---
she contradicted. 
---
How can a woman be unhappy
---
she chose freely
---
A little laugh of objection came from Sue. 
---
she said dubiously. 
---
her know
---
Her hand lay on the table, and
---
Sue drew hers
 away.


---
she said repentantly. 
---
I've seen Arabella."


---
She winced at the hit
---
When did you see her
---
So she's come back; and
---
you will live
 with her now
---
She looked at the window pots with the geraniums and cactuses,
. 
---
her eyes began
---
Why should you be so glad to go back to her! 
---
How could your heart go back to Arabella so soon?"


---
she said with gentle resentment. 
---
she had
---
she did in a vanquished tone
---
She bent down
 her face upon her hands.


---
she went on,. 
---
a woman shrinks from-- in the early days of her
 marriage
---
what she shakes down to with comfortable indifference in half a
 dozen years
---
You would have been my
 wife, Sue,
---
she rose quickly, and. 
---
she was going
---
her cross the village green towards Mrs. Edlin's
---
soon she
 sent a little girl, and.


---
she was too tired
 to see him again that night
---
Sue was sitting within its walls equally lonely and
 disheartened; and
---
a woman looking out of the open
 casement at a window on the ground floor of the adjacent cottage
---
said a voice timidly-- Sue's voice. 
---
she
 was visible down to her waist
---
She let.

"
---
a married woman in trouble of a kind like commits a mortal
 sin in making a man the confidant of it, as I did you
---
it happens to lots of
 women
---
she bent over the sill, and. 
---
She shut the casement, and
---
when it was time for her to go
---
her companion and herself disappearing on foot down the hill path
 which led into the lonely road to Alfredston
---
she said tearfully. 
---
Then she had conceded. 
---
given
 in the spirit of a cousin and a friend she saw no objection. 
---
she could not permit it
---
she had said.


---
Sue
 had said in warmth
---
the women are; or
---
Burning up your awld aunt's rubbidge I suppose? 
---
her give way to an impulse,
 if not wrongly
---
She was inclined to call it the latter
---
she jerked out. 
---
she pranced on
---
Then the slim little wife of a husband was disagreeable
 to her
---
brought weariness into her eyes by
 gazing and worrying hopelessly
---
she was

---
it must be owing to the depressing effect of her
 aunt's death and funeral
---
While ascending to the
 town seated on the top of the omnibus beside him she said suddenly
 and with an air of self- chastisement,:

". 
---
Sue had placed the minor for the major indiscretion, and
---
She remained in an unusually silent, tense, and restless condition,
 and at last,,. 
---
she was tired
---
Sue was dozing
---
The heavy, gloomy oak wainscot,," and stood in odd contrast
 to the new and shining brass bedstead, and the new suite of birch
 furniture that he had bought for her, the two styles seeming to nod
 to each other across three centuries upon the shaking floor.


---
this being the way in which he pronounced her name)
---
She was not in the bed,
---
she had apparently been there--
---
though the
 clothes on her side being flung back. 
---
she might have
 forgotten some kitchen detail and
---
when finding she did not come
---
She was not there,
 even now. 
---
She answered" Yes!" as before, but
---
she
 had suddenly become deranged
---
She had
 fastened it inside with a piece of string, which broke at his pull.

---
she had flung down some rugs and
---
she sprang out of her lair, great- eyed and
 trembling.


---
she cried excitedly.

---
She looked so pitiful and pleading in her white nightgown against the
 shadowy lumber- hole. 
---
She continued.


---
she weeping
---
Eliza will hear."

---
Sue had already gone downstairs. 
---
There was a little nest where she
 had lain, and spiders' webs hung overhead. 
---
must a woman's
 aversion be!"
---
when it is stronger than her fear of spiders
---
her sitting at the breakfast- table, and
---
so many women are--
---
to tell you that inquired of your cousin about it she said with pained surprise.


---
Her eyes had filled. 
---
" she said.

---
What she burst out,
""


---
Sue continued:.' 
---
She, or he,' or his own portion
 of it choose his plan of life for him,
---
she meant
---
She was beginning.


---
his wife turn and
---
she read it
---
as her lips slightly crisped,
---
she changed her position, and
---
She wrote again
---
No poor woman
    has ever wished
---
she had seemed
; but
---
the irksomeness of
 their position worked on her temperament, and
---
the fibres of her
 nature seemed. 
---
She talked vaguely and
.




---
her
 flinging up the sash
---
she meant
---
she had mounted upon the sill and
---
She
 disappeared in the darkness, and
---
her fall below
---
bringing Sue into the hall seated her on a chair, where he
 gazed at her by the flapping light of the candle which he had set
 down in the draught on the bottom stair
---
She had certainly not broken her neck. 
---
She looked at him with eyes

---
She pressed her side and
---
Her fall had not been a serious one,.

---
she had
---
she began
---
she was silent.


---
Her cloak was hanging at the back of the door, and
---
The aspect of things was not improved by her admission. 
---
She ascended
 the staircase slowly, the waving light of the candle shining on her.

---
her enter her room
---
I've a wife I love who not
 only does not love me, but
---
I should prefer hatred from her!"


---
she is not so much to blame as I.
---
She
 was a pupil- teacher under me,, and
---
I took advantage of
 her inexperience, and. 
---
her to agree
 to a long engagement before she well knew her own mind
---
Afterwards
 she saw somebody else, but
---
she blindly fulfilled her engagement."


---
I think-- possibly
 to herself. 
---
She is one of the oddest creatures I ever met. 
---
even
 she may like me as a friend,
---
She has conscientiously struggled against it, but to no purpose.

---
I ca n't answer her arguments
---
she has

---
Her intellect sparkles like diamonds
---
She's one too many for me!"


---
She'll get over it, good- now?"


---
there are reasons why she
 never will. 
---
she calmly and firmly asked. 
---
she might leave
 me and
---
my
 entering her room by accident
---
when owing to she jumped out of window--
---
She pretended, but
---
when a woman jumps out of window without caring
 whether she breaks her neck or no
---
Now she's not; and
---
her go
---
Whom with is her matter. 
---
her go
---
certainly she wishes. 
---
I am doing wrong in refusing
 her
---
she was puzzling and peculiar
---
Have you ever stood before a woman,--?"


---
she has pleaded for release
---
she has

---
I had not the remotest
 idea-- living apart from women as I have done for so many years-- that
 merely taking a woman to church and putting a ring upon her finger
 could by any possibility involve one in such a daily, continuous
 tragedy as that now shared by her and me!"


---
I could admit some excuse for letting her leave you,. 
---
she kept to herself
---
as she would rather endure her
 present misery than
---
that is a question for herself
---
However she has not distinctly implied,...  And,
---
she means to
---
why the woman and the children should not be the unit without the
 man
---
Does SHE say all this too?"


---
She little thinks
---
I have out- Sued Sue in this-- all in the
 last twelve hours!"


---
she's a charming young thing
---
she ought,
---
to be smacked brought to her senses that's
!"
---
she glided into the parlour to tea
---
Her nervous
 manner, begotten of a fear should be injured by her course
---
She took the slice
---
So being without a wife will
 not really be irksome to me,. 
---
she said with
 amenable gentleness. 
---
I have a sort of affection for a little
 of it that belonged to my poor mother and father. 
---
Sue was for a few moments a little tearful at these reflections, and

---
she was going for
 a short visit
---
She is quite well. 
---
She is gone--. 
---
That's her tea- cup,
. 
---
she drank out of only an hour ago
---
she is
---
I would have died for her; but
---
I would n't be cruel to her
 in the name of the law. 
---
She is,,. 
---
she has my full consent to."


---
she had left behind
---
She
 would n't take all I wanted her to
---
when I made
 up my mind to her going to live in her own way
---
To adorn her in somebody's eyes Sue had written the following
 note to Jude:


    and
---
she was carried by the omnibus farther and farther down from
 the mountain town-- the single passenger that evening-- she regarded
 the receding road with a sad face. 
---
she was departing stopped by signal only. 
---
such a powerful organization as a railway
 train should be brought to a stand- still on purpose for her-- a
 fugitive from her lawful home
---
Sue began
. 
---
she beheld Jude. 
---
She clasped his hand with both hers, and
---
her tense state
 caused. 
---
her to simmer over in a little succession of dry sobs
---
she repeated.


---
I would have deserted any day at
 your command, dear Sue. 
---
she taking up in her voice the emotion that had begun in his
---
she
 recovered her equanimity by the time.


---
she resumed. 
---
she answered. 
---
Arabella
 has actually written
---
" to ask me to get a divorce from her-- in kindness
 to her she says. 
---
She wants; and
---
she has already married virtually
---
I could n't do it without getting
 her into trouble about that second marriage
---
Perhaps she's no worse than I am, after all!

---
she wants
---
If to start afresh I have
 only too obvious reasons for not hindering her."


---
" she asked, with the discontinuity that
 marked her to- night.

"
---
She looked at him. 
---
Sue bent her forehead against the
 corner of the compartment. 
---
she put her
 face against his cheek,
---
she said,.


---
could not be quite candid
 as to the state of that mystery, her heart. 
---
Put it down to my
 timidity she said with hurried evasiveness;" to a woman's natural
 timidity. 
---
nobody will have any
 right to question her
---
she had

---
you are tender and kind to her
---
you love her
---
You were all along' the shadowy third' in my short life with
 her. 
---
she said with latent tears. 
---
she added,"! 
---
she said, and. 
---
she could
---
She
 added in hurt tones, without turning round:". 
---
My liking for you is
 not as some women's perhaps
---
she had handled thus
---
she coaxed,. 
---
when she pleaded
---
she well knew
---
she aroused herself at
 some thought
---
sometimes a woman's LOVE OF BEING LOVED
---
gets the better of her
 conscience, and
---
she is agonized at the thought of treating a
 man cruelly
---
But though she encourages him. 
---
she does n't love
 him at all
---
when she sees
---
Then her remorse sets in,
 and
---
she does."


---
she can
---
she was distressed and tearful at his criticisms,
 and
---
she said,
.


---
you are my dear Sue, from whom neither length nor
 breadth, nor things present nor things to come
---
Though so sophisticated in many things she was such a child in others
. 
---
this satisfied her, and
---
she would not go
 to the Temperance Hotel because of the form of his telegram
---
the waiting- maid spoke to Sue.


---
Oh said Sue, with a certain sickness of heart. 
---
You were lately here with Arabella. 
---
I had met her
---
you had met her
---
not you had made it up with
 her
---
I ca n't explain, Sue."


---
She was so mortified that he was
 obliged to take her into her room and close the door lest the people
 should hear. 
---
she was, after all, my legal wife,.


---
not-- Slipping down on her knees
---
if"

 Sue buried her face in the bed and
---
you must have thought much of her! 
---
Or--"

-- women never do! 
---
she pouted provokingly
---
she had never been really your wife
---
she left you of her own accord years and years ago
---
I ca n't say more without speaking against her, and
---
She has married another man--! 
---
I shall never inform against
 her! 
---
it is evidently a prick of conscience in her that has led
 her to urge me to get a divorce,. 
---
she may remarry this man
 legally
---
I shall not be likely to see her again
---
when you saw her
---
Sue more gently rose
---
she solicited,. 
---
She put the tip of her finger gingerly to her cheek; and
---
they were glad to have her settle among them
---
Sue's absence did not
 excite comment. 
---
Her place as monitor in the school was taken by
 another young woman within a few days of her vacating it
---
Sue's services having been
 of a provisional nature only. 
---
Sue had played
 him false and
---
when misapprehensions as to Sue's conduct spread abroad
---
your wife's going
 away
---
She has gone?"


---
She has gone away under circumstances that usually call for
 condolence with the husband. 
---
She asked
, and
---
I let her. 
---
A
 woman of full age it was a question of her own conscience-- not for
 me. 
---
I was not her gaoler. 
---
who was a schoolgirl just out of her standards
---
she required
---
I have acted wrongly
 by her
---
She does n't care anything about me!
---
should
 she?
---
Why She does n't know."


---
she living?"


---
its reaching her
---
there
 entered-- Sue.


---
She was in light spring clothing, and
---
her advent seemed ghostly-- like
 the flitting in of a moth. 
---
she said,. 
---
Sue did not for a moment, either now or later, suspect never once seemed, and.

---
she had received no news whatever from Shaston
---
she descended the stairs she lifted her
 eyes and hands in grotesque amazement
---
While Sue went
 to the window and."


---
She went to where a swing- glass stood, and taking it in her hands
 carried it to a spot by the window where it could catch the sunshine,
 moving the glass.

"
---
-- she said. 
---
She spoke with a
 childlike, repentant kindness,.


---
she could not do too much for
 him
---
she said quickly. 
---
she put
 her hand in
---
she was
 significantly light in touch. 
---
She had nearly closed the door!" 
---
tears
 were on her face and a quiver in her lip
---
She came back.

"
---
Sue do wish, and? 
---
, you she said hastily. 
---
It is altogether news to me that he has a wife."


---
She wrote and. 
---
it would be a kindness to her,
---
then she could marry and
---
She's his-- his from lips to heel!"
---
so she did not hear it
---
her telling him
 of her, thus far, incomplete relations with Jude; and
---
She's been here
---
She just came,."


---
I mean, what a tantalizing, capricious little woman! 
---
she were
 not your wife--"


---
She is not
---
she's another man's except in name and law. 
---
it was suggested to me by a conversation I had with
 her--
---
now she has
 been back, and. 
---
I had forgiven
 her
---
's the use of keeping
 her chained on to me if she does n't belong to me? 
---
she would welcome to her
---
she
 sympathizes with
---
she can not endure me
---
as a fellow- creature, and pities me, and even weeps for me, as a husband
 she loathes me
---
she loathes me, and my only manly, and dignified, and merciful

---
her to be independent
---
she does not know it
---
her go
---
my liberating her
---
can do her no possible harm, and
---
she has never dreamt of hitherto
---
Sue and Jude were living in Aldbrickham, in precisely the same
 relations that they had established between themselves when she
 left Shaston to join him the year before. 
---
Sue kept
 house, and.


---
As Sue held up a letter she had just
 received.

"
---
her criminal second marriage would have

---
she punished;
---
nobody took any interest in
 her--. 
---
Sue acquired her lover's cheerfulness at the sense of
 freedom, and.

---
Sue went up- stairs and.


---
we can said Sue, without enthusiasm
---
It
 is so much sweeter-- for the woman at least, and. 
---
when she is sure of
 the man
---
she sighed,". 
---
I am not so exceptional a woman.

---
Fewer women like marriage than only enter into it
 for the dignity."


---
women are taught by other women
---
Not being men these women do n't know. 
---
who
 was the soul of truth in her conduct
---
A Nemesis attends the woman who plays the game of
 elusiveness too often, in the utter contempt for her."


---
sooner
 or later her old admirers feel;
---
her to go
 unlamented to her grave
---
Sue, had acquired a guilty look; and

---
she suddenly replied in a tragic voice:!"


---
Sue was assisting Jude very
 materially now
---
Sue, laid out supper for him. 
---
Contrary to custom she did not
 speak. 
---
her face was troubled
---
She paused a moment. 
---
she answered.


---
Sue's voice quavered, and
---
she spoke
---
she suddenly
 sat down from her preparations,. 
---
whether she
 continued. 
---
when she said
---
she would
 wait
---
you might not be able to see her
---
she wanted a headstone
---
Was
 she in mourning?"


---
She was n't in mourning, and
---
she did n't want a headstone; and
---
you could n't see her
---
Sue looked critically and imploringly
 at him.

"
---
was she? 
---
Did n't she say?"


---
She would n't give her name. 
---
she was--
---
It was Arabella!"


---
should Arabella come for? 
---
it was she
---
I feel perfectly certain
 it was-- by the light in her eyes as she looked at me. 
---
She was a
 fleshy, coarse woman."


---
she may be getting so by this time under the duties of
 the public house
---
She was rather handsome."


---
when I knew her
---
she is!"


---
she is nothing to me, and
---
waiving that as virtuously married to another man why
 should she come?"


---
Are you sure she's married? 
---
why she asked me
---
She and the man both wanted,."

"
---
it WAS Arabella
---
cried Sue,. 
---
It seems such an ill omen,
 whatever she may have come for. 
---
You could not possibly see her
---
It would be so very painful to talk
 to her now-- for her as much as for me. 
---
However she's gone. 
---
she would come again
---
she went away very reluctantly."


---
Sue instantly emerged from her room,
 but.


---
she had
---
There she is again!" 
---
Sue whispered in appalled accents.


---
She knocked like that last time."


---
which was
 unmistakably Arabella's
---
Is it she?
---
said Arabella humbly.

---
Arabella hesitated. 
---
No, Jude, she returned. 
---
Sue remained at gaze, in painful tension,, but
 speaking none.


---
She was about to give the address, but
---
she
 said,". 
---
I must do her the kindness of hearing what's the
 matter
---
she's going
 back to- morrow
---
she did before
---
She is
 such a low- passioned woman
---
I can see it in her shape, and!

"
---
I love her little enough now
---
she's not your wife!"
---
are you going to her? 
---
now she's not your wife any
 more than I!"


---
she is, rather more than you
---
she is so anxious to tell me
---
She said no more, but,. 
---
when in the
 presence of nobody but herself she also trotted down,. 
---
she went
---
She listened. 
---
She knew. 
---
exactly how far
 it was to the inn that Arabella had named as her lodging
---
She looked at the clock. 
---
as she might get; and
---
she waited on. 
---
Sue gave a little ecstatic cry. 
---
I ca n't find her anywhere in this street, and
---
She has walked on,. 
---
I've been so hard- hearted
 as to refuse her requests entirely, poor woman
---
why should you take such trouble for a woman who has served
 you so badly!"
---
" Oh, but said Sue in a jealous burst of disappointment.


---
she's a woman, and
---
I once cared for her; and."


---
She is n't your wife any longer!"
---
exclaimed Sue, passionately
 excited. 
---
You
 CAN'T join her
---
now she's a stranger to you. 
---
She seems much the same as ever-- an erring, careless, unreflecting
 fellow- creature. 
---
What
 makes no
 difference in my real relations to her. 
---
she was my wife
---
she was away in Australia with another husband
---
If while
 she's my wife now."


---
she was n't! 
---
She is too low, too coarse
---
It is all very well, and
 the wickedness of coercing a woman. 
---
But I should just like a few
 virtuous people, about Arabella
 and other things, to have been in my tantalizing position with
 you through I think,."


---
Arabella has appealed to me for help. 
---
, she said,
. 
---
she were yours
---
She ran across and. 
---
her go
---
it would be unfair to you perhaps unfair to her
---
She is not like you, my darling, and
---
Sue absently agreed. 
---
her mind for the moment was
. 
---
A glow had passed away from her, and

---
depression sat upon her features.


---
she murmured. 
---
I
 did n't care about her being in trouble, and what she wished to tell
 you! 
---
Perhaps it was really something she was justified in telling
 you. 
---
how she got on
---
she reached the
 inn all right, poor woman
---
she got on all right
---
she was n't shut out, and
---
she had
---
she got in
---
I've been thinking of her all the morning."


---
You haven't the least idea how Arabella is
 able to shift for herself. 
---
There was no limit to the strange and unnecessary penances which Sue
 would meekly undertake when in a contrite mood; and
---
whose relation to her was
 precisely of a kind that would have made.

"
---
them was
 her instinct ever
---
Sue agreed, and. 
---
she had never done
 before
---
she said, a sadness showing in her smile.


---
She walked along the muddy street. 
---
she reached the public house
 mentioned by Arabella, which was not so very far off
---
She was

---
Arabella had not yet left, and
---
she sent up word that a friend from Spring Street had called,
 naming the place of Jude's residence
---
She was asked and. 
---
it was Arabella's
 bedroom, and
---
She halted on the
 turn of her toe".


---
Arabella cried from the bed,"
---
Sue accordingly did
---
Arabella lay, and. 
---
Sue was wicked enough, despite her penitence,
---
She may have seemed handsome enough in profile under
 the lamps, but
---
the sight
 of her own fresh charms in the looking- glass made Sue's manner
 bright,.


---
she reflected, and
---
a meanly sexual emotion was in
 her
---
" to see,
 she said gently. 
---
said Arabella,
 flinging her head back upon the pillows with a disappointed toss, and
.


---
she had just taken the trouble to
 produce
---
Indeed I do n't said Sue.


---
what said Sue stiffly. 
---
Sue looked out at the rain, and at the dirty toilet- cover, and at the
 detached tail of Arabella's hair hanging on the looking- glass,; and. 
---
she had not come
---
Arabella opened it.


---
she lay, and
---
her ruffled look disappeared
---
" she said
 blandly. 
---
when the maid had gone
---
She held
 out the telegram, but
---
Sue to read
---
Sue did not take it. "
---
returned Sue, with frigid pride.


---
And
-- as woman to woman, for
 any knowing you'll have the sticks
 o' furniture, and
---
she said;
---
a woman seems in trouble
---
"

" to marry him-- to make our natural
 marriage a legal one said Sue, with yet more dignity. 
---
Ah, yes-- said Arabella,. 
---
said Sue hastily.


---
the soft parts of her person shook
---
Sue jumped
 aside in trepidation. "
---
I am only a woman-- not a six- foot
 sojer!
---
she continued,
---
When Sue reached home
---
III


 was awaiting her at the door. 
---
She clasped his arm, and
---
she was preoccupied, and forbore to question her
---
Oh Jude-- I've been talking to her she said at last. 
---
she was civil
---
She's not
 an ungenerous nature; and
---
I am so glad her difficulties have all
 suddenly ended." 
---
She explained. 
---
how Arabella had been summoned back,
 and
---
Arabella has been saying to me
---
Phryne made complaint that she was tired
 of posing
---
Sue stood back,
. 
---
her lover went up to the door
---
when she said:" Jude
---
Just let she said timidly. 
---
she said
---
Her face brightened. 
---
" Yes-- said she. 
---
Sue taking his arm and
---
Whilst postponing thus a letter and a
 newspaper arrived before breakfast one morning from Arabella.

---
the handwriting went up to Sue's room and and. 
---
she was dressed
---
as soon as she hastened down
---
Sue opened the
 newspaper; Jude the letter. 
---
she held
 across the first page to him with her finger on a paragraph
---
" Look! said she.


---
CARTLETT-- DONN"; the united pair being Arabella and the inn- keeper
---
However she is provided for now in a way poor thing. 
---
I suppose, whatever her faults,

---
we are able to think that, than to be
 uneasy about her
---
my mother and father have lately written
---
Sue's look was one of dismay. 
---
What, dear she asked
 faintly.


---
Sue watched him anxiously, with heavy
 breaths.


---
when
 she says
---
why she did n't tell me
---
when
 I met her at Christminster
---
she said something about having
 a thing on her mind
---
she would like me,
---
Sue replied, and
---
her
 eyes filled.


---
Sue jumped up and. 
---
she murmured.


---

---
The woman opened the cover now and then,. 
---
she had
. 
---
when she could absolutely postpone no longer
---
she had known
 for weeks of his approaching arrival
---
she truly said,

---
she had received her
 former husband's answer at some time in the afternoon
---
Arabella had looked him over with
 an expression that was as good as saying," You are very much what I
 expected you to be
---
Mother did n't wish."


---
Sue was about to
 enter her chamber adjoining.


---
when she heard and
---
Sue ran up to Jude's room and and
---
What-- she asked.


---
She scrutinized the child's features, and. 
---
Arabella says
---
she, and holding his hand
---
she had looked at him
---
who's my REAL mother
---
Can I call
 you Mother?"


---
Sue
 thereupon could not refrain from instantly doing likewise,.


---
You may call me Mother,, my poor dear!
---
if she said,
.


---
Well-- said Sue. 
---
said Sue. 
---
And said Sue tenderly. 
---
Of course not she was hating you all the
 time!"


---
Both Sue and Jude together went to the office of the district
---
she read the
 four- square undertaking

As never before seen by her,
---
her own and were inserted, and
---
to be parties now,
 not lovers she thought).
---
she said on their way home.

---
that hath betrothed a wife and
---
She could not bear its aspect. 
---
Coming after her
 previous experience of matrimony all the romance of their attachment
 seemed. 
---
She was usually leading little Father Time by the hand,
 and.


---
she would come
---
she
 did,. 
---
She was allotted the spare room in
 Jude's house,,.


---
whither she retired early, and
---
where they could hear
 her through the ceiling below
---
however she could not sleep, and
---
Sue and Jude
 were still sitting up
---
As,, discovered that it being in fact only ten o'clock dressed
 herself again and
---
your great- aunt was
---
Sue breathed uneasily.


---
She ran away from him, with their child,
 to her friends; and
---
she was there
---
she would n't give it
 up. 
---
His wife went mad. 
---
she said,

---
"-- she
 murmured. 
---
Sue, Jude, and the widow stood in the background
,. 
---
she
 was soon, obviously,, and
---
she had a black eye.

---
She met him at the gaol gates, and. 
---
She's

---
Sue turned her head and.

---
her mouth shaping itself like that of
 a child about to give way to grief
---
turned to her lover,:

 I do n't like it here! 
---
she paused, and
---
her little voice began
 anew:"
---
she
 would
---
she must
---
which was owing to the weakness of her
 character,
---
who scorned her
---
the other poor soul-- to
 escape a nominal shame degrading herself to the real shame of bondage to a tyrant
-- a man whom to avoid for ever was her only chance of
 salvation... 
---
Sue said. 
---
she supposed
---
" Let she said," and
.
---
her mechanical
 murmur of words whose meaning
---
her brain seemed
---
Sue and Jude listened,
 and.


---
It is not the same to her, poor thing, as it would be to me doing it
 over again with my present knowledge
---
Sue whispered. 
---
" if knowing this, are proposing
 to perjure ourselves she said.


---
she hesitated
---
just she did
---
Sue still held. 
---
Sue said more brightly:

"
---
Sue sighed.


---
some women fail,
---
" No-- don't let she continued. 
---
accompanied by a woman of
 rather fine figure and rather red face, dressed in black material,
 and,.


---
her glisten

---
when the woman said,"
---
I lived as a girl at Aldbrickham, and
---
if said his wife.


---
when her attention
 was attracted by a young couple leading a child, who had come out
 from the second platform, into which the train from Aldbrickham had
 steamed
---
" Sakes alive!" said Arabella.


---
when Arabella was new to him
---
Arabella so regulated her pace and her husband's as. 
---
Her answers to Cartlett's remarks
 were vague and slight, for the group in front interested her more
 than all the rest of the spectacle.


---
" said Arabella with a curious,
 sudden covetousness. 
---
the smouldering maternal instinct was strong enough
 in her
---
although to lead her to quash her husband's conjecture she was not
. 
---
She looks quite a girl."


---
The unwitting Sue and Jude, the couple
 in question had determined. 
---
flexible and light as a bird her little thumb
 stuck up by the stem of her white cotton sunshade,. 
---
she hardly touched ground, and
---
a moderately strong puff of wind
 would float her over the hedge into the next field
---
The pair with their charge passed through the turnstiles, Arabella
 and her husband not far behind them. 
---
When the
 publican's wife could see
---
How she sticks to him!
---
said Arabella. 
---
she rejoined. 
---
attracted by
 what Arabella's sharpened vision discerned
---
she were some fairy
---
She's not a particular warm- hearted creature to my
 thinking,
---
she cares for him pretty middling much
---
though as much as
 she's able to; and
---
her heart ache a bit--
---
she d where were being exhibited,
 and Arabella in the direction taken by Jude and Sue. 
---
however she had regained
---
their wake met her own,
 and
---
she was confronted by Anny, the friend of her girlhood.


---
I am still living down there as soon as
 she was composed. 
---
she said,
---
She's
---
pretty is n't she!"


---
" murmured she.


---
what woman do n't should like? 
---
she do n't know! 
---
I
 can see in her face."

"
---
she do n't
---
she calls love
---
you do n't look a day older than
 when you knew me as a girl
---
Arabella was induced.


---
Arabella and her friends came to it in due course, and
---
Admiring their own work said Arabella. 
---
Arabella did not care;

---
they should recognize her
---
She walked round the outside of the listening throng,
---
whose movements had an unexpected fascination for
 her to- day. 
---
Scrutinizing them narrowly from the rear she noticed
.


---
Arabella whispered to herself
 morosely,
---
she rejoined her companions,
---
she preserved a
 preoccupied silence.


---
the physician to Arabella, apart do want anything
 such as this, Mrs. Cartlett
---
She produced five shillings
---
she was due at an appointment with her husband
---
Saying
 presently that she
 sauntered away towards the refreshment bar, Jude, his companion, and
 the child having gone on to the horticultural tent, where Arabella
 caught a glimpse of them standing before a group of roses in bloom.


---
She waited a few minutes and. 
---
She found.


---
Arabella
 remarked gloomily. 
---
now we have met," she returned, ready to quarrel
 with the sun for shining on her. 
---
she gazed
---
In the meantime the boy Sue's usually pale cheeks reflecting the pink of
 the tinted roses at which had quickened
 her blood and. 
---
her eyes sparkle with vivacity
---
She adored roses,
 and.


---
Arabella had witnessed
---
she learnt the names of this variety and that
---
she had

---
so her nose went among the petals
---
Then she looked up at him, and.


---
that told so much to
 Arabella
---
She nodded.


---
that because
 she went on
---
she looked at the aged child, whom.


---
discussed by
 other persons than Arabella
---
who had
 previously been called Mrs. Bridehead
---
Sue, now openly adopted the name of
 Mrs. Fawley. 
---
Her dull, cowed, and listless manner for days seemed
.


---
The baker's lad and the grocer's boy, at first to lift
 their hats gallantly to Sue to execute their errands no longer took the trouble,
 and
---
when they encountered her
---
Sue was always.


---
she saddened
---
Well-- said she presently. 
---
Sue could hear
 the conversation:

... 
---
Sue came, and also.


---
she could render
---
The silence and emptiness of the building gave her confidence, and,

---
she was
 nevertheless timid at mounting
---
standing on a safe low platform, which she began. 
---
She was quite pleased at her powers
---
she had acquired them
 in the days she painted illumined texts for the church- fitting shop
 at Christminster. 
---
a young woman
 was assisting
---
Sue had told him. 
---
She came down from her perch,
 and?"


---
Sue returned to her work. 
---
Sue recognized
 her as one who had friends in Spring Street, whom she visited. 
---
The
 church- cleaner looked at Sue,
---
gaped, and lifted her hands she had

---
the latter had recognized
 her
---
Sue stood reaching upward
---
her
 hand tracing the letters, and
---
she grew so nervous that she
 trembled visibly
---
Sue could not hear which--"She's his wife
---
Then she ought
---
who had been talking to the old woman
---
she meant by calling them strange people
---
Sue and Jude, working sent back the child to school, and
---
she had been crying
 silently
---
However Sue
 seemed.


---
she laughed
---
she said,"! 
---
she laughed again
 silently and intermittently,.


---
she was quite weak
---
she sighed. 
---
she took up the
 brush and
---
I am afraid I must ask
 you and her to leave off, and
---
Sue cleansed her brush.

---
she dropping to her tragic note
---
Sue cooked her
 own
---
to be a wet day moreover Sue was unwell, and

---
; not wishing to desert her poor Jude in such gloomy circumstances,
 for to stay awhile she acted on the suggestion of
 the auctioneer's man, and.

---
Sue silently took
 her companion's hand, and
---
Arabella is there?"


---
she said,. 
---
I
 grew up in the baking business with aunt,. 
---
They were Sue's pets, and
---
Sue tried
---
she heard the trifling sum that her dears were deemed to be worth
 advanced by small stages to the price
---
When she was left alone
---
she waited patiently, but
---
she started, and on passing the
 poulterer's shop, not far off
---
she saw her pigeons in a hamper by the
 door. 
---
her to act on impulse
---
, first looking around her
 quickly she pulled out the peg which fastened down the cover, and
. 
---
Sue reached the lodging trembling, and. 
---
she asked breathlessly.


---
she explained,
 in bitter contrition.


---
" Yes! said Sue vehemently.


---
Sue had occupied
---
Her sombre suit, of pronounced cut, caused
.


---
her to appear a little out of place in the medley and bustle of a
 provincial fair
---
, said the
 woman in weeds reprovingly. 
---
The companions then went their several ways, the one in crape walking
 firmly along with a mien of disconnection from her miscellaneous
 surroundings. 
---
she came to a hoarding,
---
Having ascertained thus much the immensely weeded widow retraced her
 steps, and.

---
tended by a young woman apparently unused to the business
---
she being
 accompanied by a boy with an octogenarian face, who assisted her.


---
" Upon my-- senses!" murmured the widow to herself. 
---
she is so
---
His wife Sue-- if
!"  drew nearer to the stall. "
---
she said blandly.


---
Sue changed colour and.


---
she said stiffly. 
---
her voice grew sympathetic in spite of herself
---
You be the woman I thought wer my mother for a bit, till
 I found you was n't
---
Arabella continued:
---
her tender
 little mouth began.


---
Sue's lips quivered again. 
---
she's leaving soon
---
She had helped
 herself, and
---
Still harping on Christminster-- even in his cakes! laughed
 Arabella. 
---
Sue sighed, and
---
she looked her distress at hearing him criticized.

"
---
Arabella was quizzing Sue with more regard of how she was speaking
 than of what she was saying. 
---
a woman selling

---
she said. 
---
She shook her head. 
---
Here in Kennetbridge Sue's manner showed Arabella.

"
---
her random guess was right
---
continued Arabella. 
---
" she
 cried.


---
I am not the
 woman to find fault with what the Lord has ordained. 
---
Then Arabella wished Sue good- bye, and.




---
Arabella Cartlett and her
 weeds stood among them. 
---
She had a clear, powerful voice,.


---
Arabella was in a thoughtful mood; but

---
her thoughts were not of the new chapel,.


---
" No-- at last said Arabella sullenly. 
---
I've seen
 HER!"


---
her lover having jilted her.)


---
" What urged Arabella morbidly.


---
Arabella and Jude had lived during the first months of
 their marriage, and
---
were passing the lonely
 house in which she could
 control herself no longer.


---
she burst out. 
---
Arabella had hastily drawn from her pocket a bundle of tracts which
 she had brought with her to distribute at the fair, and of which she
 had given away several. 
---
she spoke
---
As she flung the whole remainder
 of the packet into the hedge. 
---
Arabella did calm herself down by degrees; and
---
Arabella looked at him, and
---
she spoke.

---
I
 should you?--Arabella Donn
---
her loss was a loss to me in more ways than one
---
You lost your school and good income through her
---
the vicar having known me before my so- called eccentric
 conduct towards my wife
---
She has done
 no better."


---
She is not doing well,"


---
I met her by accident at Kennetbridge this very day, and
---
she is
 anything but thriving. 
---
You
 made a fool of a mistake about her and
---
She was innocent."


---
She was quite innocent of
 what obtained you your freedom, at the time you obtained it. 
---
I saw
 her just afterwards, and."


---
Still she wanted
---
you should n't have let her. 
---
That's the only way with
 these fanciful women that chaw high-- innocent or guilty. 
---
She'd have
. 
---
she's fond of her man still
---
You were too quick about her. 
---
her go
---
I should have kept her! 
---
There's nothing like
 bondage and a stone- deaf taskmaster for taming us women. 
---
the woman shall bear her iniquity
---
she's got
 her deserts now."


---
Sue though remarkably successful in her cake- selling
 experiment at Kennetbridge fair had lost the temporary brightness
 which had begun to sit upon her sadness on account of that success.

---
they met an old woman carrying a child in short clothes,
 and
---
Sue kissed the children, and?"


---
She told him the
 pecuniary results, and. 
---
she informed him of the unexpected meeting with Arabella, and
 the latter's widowhood.


---
is she living here
---
No said Sue.


---
she continued,.


---
is she doing there?"


---
She told him all she knew. "
---
She has taken to chapel- going
---
Sue
 added;" and."


---
Sue asked, a troublousness in her
 tones.


---
it would surprise
 her, perhaps,
---
she did n't mind
---
she said pensively.

---
she humbled her body greatly, and all the places
     of her joy she filled with her torn hair."--ESTHER( Apoc.).


      
---
said Sue. 
---
But she said,.


---
" she asked.


---
She saw from his face. 
---
if she answered. 
---
Sue and the others kept immediately behind him
---
They are only learned Doctors said Sue.


---
Sue again wished.


---
, said a woman.


---
Sue's face grew more emotional; but
---
she stood close to Jude

---
though she was screened.


---
Sue only possessed a small one, half sunshade. 
---
She
 had grown pale,.


---
" Let she whispered,.

---
the newcomers knocked at the
 door of one, which a woman opened.


---
The householder scrutinized Sue's figure a moment. 
---
she shutting the door
---
said
 Sue,". 
---
" said Sue. 
---
The woman
 here was more amiable; but
---
she had little room to spare, and. 
---
They came to terms with
 her,. 
---
her price was rather high for their pockets
---
Sue took possession of a back room
 on the second floor with an inner closet- room for the children. 
---
she had taken in
---
she was
---
Are you really a married woman
---
Sue hesitated; and
---
Sue had not the art of prevarication, and, after admitting several
 facts as to their late difficulties and wanderings, startled
 by the landlady saying suddenly:

"?"

 then impulsively told the woman that each been unhappy in their first marriages terrified at the thought of a second irrevocable union, and

---
Therefore she was a married
 woman, in the landlady's sense
---
she was not.


---
Sue sat by
 the window in a reverie,. 
---
she was explaining to him the incoming of
 the lodgers during his absence.


---
The wife expostulated, but,
---
, presently a tap came to Sue's door, and
---
the woman
 appeared.


---
she said,". 
---
she knew
---
she was entitled to the lodging for a week
---
Though that Sue
 did not wish,
 and
---
she said. 
---
she would leave
---
gone Sue looked out of the window again. 
---
she proposed to the boy
---
Sue resolving
---
she
 wandered into this street and into that; but
---
she tried a dozen
 different houses she fared far worse alone than she had fared in
 Jude's company, and
---
Every householder looked askance at such a woman and
 child inquiring for accommodation in the gloom.


---
Thoroughly tired at last Sue returned to the place where she was
 not welcome, but. 
---
where at least she had temporary shelter
---
knowing she adhered to her determination not to disturb him till the next
 day.

II


 Sue sat
---
then she regarded the scene
 outside the uncurtained window. 
---
she occupied
---
She thought of
 the strange operation of a simple- minded man's ruling passion,. 
---
said Sue despondently. 
---
you are not my real mother,
 and
---
Sue did not reply. 
---
She was doubtfully pondering.


---
She at last concluded.


---
so far as she
 would be honest and candid with one who entered into her difficulties
 like an aged friend
---
to be another in our family soon she hesitatingly
 remarked.


---
murmured Sue,
---
her eyes glistening
 with suspended tears
---
she pleaded,.
---
There she heard!"


---
dear she cried, rather peremptorily
---
she awoke at a little past six, and. 
---
her to be his quarters,
---
She arose softly,.


---
she knew
---
She found Jude at breakfast in the obscure tavern he had chosen as a
 counterpoise to the expense of her lodging: and
---
she explained to him
 her homelessness. 
---
She joined Jude in a hasty meal, and
---
she
 found. 
---
she had brought with her
---
she put
 them into the boiling kettle, and.


---
she went,
---
A shriek from Sue suddenly caused
. 
---
she pushed
 it back
---
Sue had sunk to the floor just within it
---
those of the girl and the baby boy were.


---
Sue lie,
---
Sue had come to herself, and
---
the two helpless
 women bending over the children in wild efforts to restore them,
 and the triplet of little corpses formed a sight which overthrew
 his self- command. 
---
They carried her away against her; and
---
there she lay, her slight figure shaken with her
 gasps, and
---
her eyes staring at the ceiling
---
the woman of the house
 vainly trying.


---
she implored, and. 
---
if her presence might
 do harm, and the reminder that it was necessary to take care of
 herself lest she should endanger a coming life
---
Her inquiries were
 incessant, and
---
she could speak
---
As soon as she informed him.


---
she had said to the
 boy, and
---
how she thought herself the cause of this
---
this stimulated Sue to efforts of sympathy which in
 some degree distracted her from her poignant self- reproach
---
she was allowed.


---
" What said Sue, her spasmodic breathing suspended.


---
She sobbed again. 
---
moaned Sue. 
---
she went back again to her room. 
---
she would not now have removed,
---
though have got them out of her sight. 
---
she
 implored him, and.


---
when she also attempted
---
she cried out, after
 one of these. 
---
too obscurely.--Why
 was I half- wiser than my fellow- women
---
she afforded us-- instincts which
 civilization had taken upon itself to thwart
---
now Fate has given us this stab in the back for being such
 fools as to take Nature at her word!"


---
She sank into a quiet contemplation,
---
she said,
---
Again Sue looked at the hanging little frock and at the socks and
 shoes; and
---
her figure quivered like a string. 
---
she said," good neither for earth nor heaven any more!

---
She stared at Jude, and.


---
She paused. 
---
she asked heavily.


---
her grief would return in a wave.


---
Sue had declared. 
---
she would follow the two little
 ones to the grave, but at the last moment she gave way, and
---
she was lying
 down
---
The woman thought, but
.

---
she was still lying down
---
she was not in her bedroom after all
---
Her hat and jacket too were
---
,, missing she had gone out. 
---
She had not
 been there. 
---
It was Sue,
---
she had never thought of changing for the mourning he
 had bought
---
she cried wildly. 
---
when she saw Jude
---
She's been wanting
---
her get
 to the coffins
---
She ought. 
---
She is hardly responsible, poor thing,
 seemingly. 
---
Sue kept! 
---
Thus she went on. 
---
her to support her
---
whispered tenderly, and put his arm round she helplessly gave in, and.


---
Sue was
---
Sue was convalescent,. 
---
she had hoped for death, and
---
Vague
 and quaint imaginings had haunted Sue in the days
---
when her intellect
 scintillated like a star
---
herself fleeing from a persecutor
---
she said mournfully. 
---
she murmured. 
---
she said quickly. 
---
she was not the Sue of their earlier time
---
she said, with a little quiver in her words,".

---
Sue sighed uneasily.


---
Sue and himself had mentally travelled in opposite directions
 since the tragedy: events which had enlarged his own views of life,
 laws, customs, and dogmas
---
She was no longer the same as in the independent days, when
 her intellect played like lambent lightning over conventions and
 formalities which he at that time respected, though he did not now.


---
She was
 not at home, but
---
she soon returned,.


---
are you thinking of, little woman
---
dear!--there's no evil woman in you. 
---
as you are absolutely the most ethereal, least sensual
 woman I ever knew to exist without inhuman sexlessness. 
---
she were an infant
---
" not to stay like this she murmured,.

"
---
when she had remained
 in the position a long while
---
She paused, and. 
---
Never she whispered.


---
she had

---
she was wide awake
 all the time
---
She sat upright and.


---
She stopped. 
---
she
 could control the lumpiness of her throat
---
You certainly ARE my wife, Sue, in all but
 law. 
---
a woman's form appeared.


---
she sat down in the window
 bench,;
 but
---
where they could distinctly see her outline against the light
---
she was not
,
---
she
 had been during Cartlett's lifetime
---
she had never replied to his letter
---
" she said. 
---
A sigh came from the dark corner where Sue sat.


---
The unexpectedness of her words struck Jude silent.


---
, said Arabella. 
---
her new and
 transcendental views lurked in her words
---
missed by Arabella
---
she was struck by Sue's avowal
---
, went on to talk with placid bluntness about" her",
 for whom, though in his lifetime she she now exhibited a ceremonial mournfulness. 
---
She alluded to the past, and. 
---
Sue had
 invisibly left the room.


---
She said?"
---
she was not your wife
---
Why should she do that?"


---
She is,? 
---
is n't she
---
She once told me so."


---
she says
---
Mother died
 of dys. 
---
Jude's former wife had maintained a stereotyped manner of strict good
 breeding even now that Sue was gone, and. 
---
When
 she had departed Jude, much relieved
---
what had become of her
---
she
 had not come in
---
Sue might have gone to St. Silas' church,

---
she often went there
---
She knows somebody who keeps the key, and."


---
she has it
---
whenever she
 wants it
---
How long has she been going on with this?"


---
Sue whispered.


---
white she had turned up her face.

"
---
she said almost sharply.

---
when Arabella came--
---
She seems, and
---
Arabella's child
 killing mine was a judgement-- the right slaying the wrong. 
---
she came
---
though she preferred.


---
she said in a sweet and imploring voice.

---
I am not your wife
---
is it common to woman? 
---
Is a woman a thinking
 unit at all, or a fraction always wanting its integer? 
---
she had returned the key. "
---
Can this be the girl
---
when she came back,
---
can this be the girl who brought
 the pagan deities into this most Christian city?--who Shelley, and Mill? 
---
when she crushed them with her heel?--quoted Gibbon
---
" Oh do n't, do n't be so cruel to me, Jude, and I so unhappy! she
 sobbed. 
---
Arabella's coming was the
 finish. 
---
she could hinder him
---
She said. 
---
she wanted no supper, and

---
Turning she found. 
---
She
 went to him, and."


---
An average woman is
 in this superior to an average man--
---
she never instigates
---
you had n't
 broken me down by making me fear you would go back to her
---
which undermines some women's morals

---
you go-- possibly to Arabella
 again--
---
Sue burst out. 
---
The woman mostly gets the worst of
 it in the long run!"


---
She does."


---
she is absolutely worthless and contemptible. 
---
Sue drew a nervous breath or two. 
---
She is--
---
Sue looked at him, and
---
that she brokenly murmured. 
---
she starting up
---
she said," Good- bye,
 good- bye
---
she got free,
---
I saw her, too."


---
you did see
 her
---
I have good
 reason for supposing that she was innocent when I divorced her-- that
 I was all wrong
---
She has taken care, anyhow, apparently."

" H'm.
---
Arabella having made her home at Alfredston, and
---
where she had stayed much longer
---
she
 had
---
she was approaching the town
---
" she replied. 
---
where I lived
 as maid and wife, and all the past things of my life that are
 interesting to my feelings
---
She do n't live with him any
 longer. 
---
She has never really married him
. 
---
And,, she as only hers is of a more' sterical sort
 than mine. 
---
she says,."


---
she's your wife in the
 eye of Heaven and the Church
---
perhaps she feels, over and above other things,. 
---
Arabella gave it.


---
Arabella smiled grimly from where the pollard willows begin
 to the old almshouses in the first street of the town.


---
she resumed her way, and
---
Sue coming out of
 the door
---
her recalcitrant
 spirit would soon have been broken
---
she came willingly
---
now she was gone
---
her be
---
she were anybody's wife
---
if she was
 the wife of the man to whom she had borne three children and owed
 such tragical adventures
---
She's affected by Christminster
 sentiment and teaching. 
---
I can see her views on the indissolubility
 of marriage well enough, and
---
where she got them
---
it has done little
 more than finish her education
---
I shall write to her, and."


---
that woman said
---
her views had considerably changed
---
she should come to him there at Marygreen
---
It had been in the trembling accents of Sue.

---
too much affected to go on talking at first she too was
 now such a mere cluster of nerves and
---
I want," she presently said, her voice now quick, now
 slow," so that you may not hear of it by chance. 
---
you are MY wife! 
---
" Yes; she answered with despairing
 self- suppression. 
---
Strictly speaking you, too-- don't mind my saying
 it Jude!--you should take back-- Arabella."


---
The blow of her
 bereavement seemed. 
---
her conviction was proof against
 all. 
---
she was firm
---
her firmness in had left her tottering in every other
 impulse and
---
she possessed
---
to tell it you myself she said in cut tones;". 
---
She was so sadly sweet in what he called her wrong- headedness that
 Jude could not help being moved to tears more than once for pity of
 her. 
---
I never knew such a woman for doing impulsive penances, as
 you, Sue! 
---
Sue had been there often, and
---
she knew the way
 to the spot in the dark. 
---
" said she.


---
Sue's slim shape was only just discernible going towards the
 station.


---
Sue's gone from me--!"
---
She in the meantime had left by the train, and. 
---
where she entered the steam- tram and
---
She wished
---
she said,.


---
she hired at the Bear
---
The little car to drive her to
 set her down at the end of the lane, half a mile from the
 village, by her desire, and. 
---
she had brought
---
she
 encountered it, and. 
---
her things
 had been taken in by the schoolmaster himself
---
She could now enter Marygreen without exciting much observation.

---
She crossed by the well and under the trees to the pretty new school
 on the other side, and. 
---
she looking pale and shaken, and
---
you forgive your-- wife!"


---
" Everything, darling Susanna said Phillotson.


---
She started at the endearment,. 
---
Then she nerved herself again.


---
Sue imperceptibly shrank away,.


---
" Oh no,-- she said, with a hurried smile of apprehension. 
---
Unlike a woman in ordinary, Sue seemed. 
---
she uttered a little" Oh!" and. 
---
her eye had caught a document which lay there. 
---
she said,.


---
she
 came back to the table
---
Sue nervously
 made herself agreeable to him by talking on whatever she thought
 likely to interest him, except herself,. 
---
She obediently ate some supper, and. 
---
The old woman accompanied Sue to her temporary quarters, and. 
---
she laid out a night- gown
.


---
said Sue quickly. 
---
She handed a new and
 absolutely plain garment, of coarse and unbleached calico.


---
She took it, and, the tears
 resounding through the house like a screech- owl.


---
Mrs. Edlin lifted her hands, and
---
Sue excitedly continued.


---
Sue repeated. 
---
Sue flung her face upon the bed,. 
---
She remained, and.


---
She remained with her face in the bed- clothes, and
---
A light was burning in Sue's room,.


---
Gillingham had evidently been impressed with the indefinable charm of
 Sue, and. 
---
She ca n't very well go a second time. 
---
I am right in taking her at her word
---
her being
---
she is
---
Apart from what
 a luxury for a fogey like me it will set me right
 in the eyes of the clergy and orthodox laity, who have never forgiven
 me for letting her go. 
---
you've got any sound reason for marrying her again
---
you
 had n't been so weak about her
---
her housed again,
---
her go
---
I know woman better now. 
---
there was in releasing her
---
the reactionary spirit would make Phillotson more orthodoxly cruel to her
 than he had erstwhile been informally and perversely kind.


---
Women are so strange in their influence
 that they tempt you to misplaced kindness. 
---
She'll come to any terms in time."


---
when I left after the row
 that was made about my agreeing to her elopement
---
she'll come, and
---
she should have thought of doing so."


---
I've been upstairs with her,; and
---
She's forcing herself to it, poor dear little thing; and
. 
---
you've no notion what she's suffering
---
her do this
---
it was
 very good and forgiving of' ee to take her to' ee again
---
She's his wife. 
---
She had three
 children by him, and
---
it's a wicked shame to
 egg her on to this, poor little quivering thing! 
---
She's got nobody
 on her side. 
---
who'd be her friend
---
What first put her into this mood o'
 mind
---
It is all voluntary on her part.

---
When Mrs. Edlin had gone back to her cottage Phillotson
---
she is really compelling herself to this against her
 instincts--
---
her wait a bit
---
when she gave that little cry at sight of the licence
---
I did n't urge more objections to your letting her
 go, and
---
they do n't know Sue.

---
she has ever done anything against her conscience
---
she left me for him
---
she thought. 
---
she was quite within her right
---
Now
 she thinks otherwise."


---
she was pleased to call her principles
---
her name connoted as she did in that pallid
 morning light
---
Chastened world- weary remorseful, the strain on her
 nerves had preyed upon her flesh and bones, and
---
she appeared smaller
 in outline than she had formerly done,.


---
Sue had not been a
 large woman in her days of rudest health
---
they left the house, Widow Edlin
 continuing steadfast in her refusal to assist in the ceremony.


---
said Sue. 
---
She had not lived there for any
 length of time.


---
Sue said no more;
---
her go
---
when the
 clergyman came to the words," What God hath joined," a woman's voice
 from among these was heard to utter audibly:

" God hath jined indeed
---
Sue was making a pretence of doing
 some housewifery. 
---
she lived there
---
she seemed timid at his
 approach, and
---
Sue brightened a little.




---
A woman in shabby black stood on the doorstep,
.


---
a woman to keep virtuous
---
The woman in the rain was Arabella,.


---
" said Arabella. 
---
She bent her head against
 the doorpost and.


---
She has really taken me; but

---
she
 could get out of the strait
---
she was in-- not by her own fault,-- and.


---
she
 declared
---
While for Arabella said:"?"


---
She had just heard
: but
---
she did n't know."


---
Do n't speak of her I say
---
She's a fool! 
---
she's an angel, too,
 poor dear!"


---
Arabella was duly installed in the little attic, and
---
she
 did not come near Jude at all. 
---
She went to and
---
fro about her own
 business,,, she was that of obtaining another place in
 the occupation she understood best. 
---
she shook her
 head. "
---
No-- she said.
---
following, she meekly asked him
---
she might come in to breakfast
 with him, and
---
she had broken her teapot,
---
While she suddenly observed:. 
---
It is about her,. 
---
she
 has friends at Marygreen
---
Arabella went,. 
---
When she had gone
---
Why should I
 have charged her
---
She's nothing to
 me-- nor the other neither!"


---
she might bring, and
---
Arabella had made dimples
 most successfully all the way home, and
---
when she stepped out of the
 railway carriage
---
she smiled. 
---
She observed, however, the
 hard strain upon his lip as he spoke.


---
she has heard from Belinda, her relation out at Marygreen,
 that it was very sad, and curious
---
She wanted
---
to marry him again did n't she?

---
She wanted to in one sense, but not in the
 other. 
---
Sue was that excited about it that she burnt her
 best embroidery that she'd worn with you, to blot you out entirely.

---
a woman feels
---
if she ought. 
---
I commend her
 for it,." 
---
Arabella sighed. 
---
She felt. 
---
she belonged to nobody else in the sight of
 God A'mighty
---
Perhaps another woman feels the same
 about herself, too!" 
---
Arabella sighed again.


---
ca nt said Arabella. 
---
I feel exactly the same as she!"


---
Sue had not dwelt on this.


---
Arabella meanwhile had gone back. 
---
she said to him,". 
---
She then sallied out again, and
---
where she had been
 barmaid for a brief term
---
She had
---
she entered and.


---
She saw.


---
Arabella held up her
 finger to the barmaid. 
---
Sue has served me badly,
 very badly. 
---
I did n't expect it of Sue! 
---
I stuck to her, and
---
she
 ought. 
---
I'd have sold my soul for her sake, but

---
she would n't risk hers a jot for me. 
---
To save her own soul she lets
!... 
---
it is n't her fault, poor little girl
---
How Arabella had obtained money. 
---
she ordered a
 liqueur each, and
---
Arabella kept very considerably
 in the rear of Jude; but
---
she only sipped
---
though she
 took as much as she could safely take without losing her head--.


---
the crimson upon her countenance showed
---
she replied,"!" 
---
Arabella put her
 arm round his waist, and
---
she said:". 
---
Sue to understand such things
---
I
 was her seducer-- poor little girl! 
---
she's gone-- and
---
yet she did it for
 conscience' sake, poor little Sue!"


---
she was right
---
I've
 my feelings too, like her; and
---
she softly unfastened the
 door,.


---
she did
---
she said. 
---
when she had fastened up
 the door
---
She pulled off his boots. 
---
Now she whispered,". 
---
VII


 Arabella was preparing breakfast in the downstairs back room of this
 small, recently hired tenement of her father's. 
---
She put her head
 into the little pork- shop in front, and.

---
She looked deedily into his face.

---
But to be up there said Donn,.


---
Arabella was suddenly seized with
 a fit of loud laughter,.


---
Be civil to him, and she said. 
---
when she had

---
Arabella ascended the stairs,. 
---
her shorn Samson was asleep

---
Finding that she entered to the bedside and. 
---
Her ardent gaze seemed
---
said she. 
---
Arabella took his purse,.


---
putting on her
 outdoor things went off to the lodgings she and he had quitted the
 evening before
---
ere she reappeared round the
 corner,
---
she had taken to the lodging for her short sojourn there
---
she expressed it--
---
suggested by her
---
Donn had only just opened his miserable little pork and sausage
 shop, which had as yet scarce any customers;. 
---
Arabella took him at his word so far as the men went, but.


---
" Yes!" cried Arabella,. 
---
she was sitting beside Jude
---
Well, to arrive to
 tell the truth she continued bashfully, and. 
---
she was announcing, or
 indeed to anything
---
Arabella
 whispered to her father
---
Now she said to Jude. 
---
she had made so tipsy
 by her special knowledge of that line of business
---
Why said Arabella,. 
---
There's only one
 woman-- but
---
I wo n't mention her in this Capharnaum!"


---
Arabella looked towards her father. "
---
Keep your figures for your debts to friends said
 Donn.


---
I am-- though
 how I came to be here with her
---
I have never behaved dishonourably to
 a woman or to any living thing. 
---
she putting her cheek against
 Jude's
---
Arabella too had hastily arranged herself,
 and
---
accompanied by Donn away
---
Do n't go she said to the guests at parting. 
---
I've told the little
 maid; and
---
When Arabella, Jude, and Donn had disappeared on their matrimonial
 errand
---
She's got. 
---
her say so to her
 father
---
Take her all together, limb by limb she's not such a bad- looking
 piece
---
she's passable enough. 
---
I like a woman that a puff o' wind wo n't
 blow down."


---
Their eyes followed the movements of the little girl. 
---
she spread
 the breakfast- cloth on the table they had been using, without wiping
 up the slops of the liquor
---
her
 face was enough to show that her strategy had succeeded.

"
---
The Church do n't recognize divorce in her
 dogma,
---
She said. 
---
Arabella was saying to him. 
---
Arabella kiss Jude one evening when she had taken a
 little cordial
---
her haranguing Jude in rattling terms,
 and
---
She asked
 him indifferently.

"
---
me to write to her for
---
how she is,
---
she'll come,,
 and
---
you to insult a lawful wife by asking such a thing
---
I love Sue. 
---
to mince the matter there stands the
 fact: I love her. 
---
I could find a dozen ways of sending a letter to
 her without your knowledge. 
---
A message through you asking her to come
 is at least free from any odour of intrigue. 
---
she retains any of
 her old nature at all
---
If she'll come."


---
HER to know
---
She do n't want. 
---
She's the rat that forsook the sinking ship!"


---
Arabella knew
---
where she was
---
" What gasped Arabella.


---
Promise never to speak of her."

"
---
she estimated his life with an
 appraiser's eye. 
---
I'll send for her,"

---
Arabella murmured,"."


---
you'll agree to my being in the room with you
 all the time she's here
---
she had written
---
she said;". 
---
she really did post it
---
She did not come; but
---
no Sue appeared;
---
Arabella had never posted hers,
---
she had written
 it
---
There was something in her manner which told it. 
---
Arabella thought.


---
when she came into the room
---
, after an absence of
 two hours, she beheld the chair empty.


---
she flopped on the bed, and
---
she said.


---
a conviction
 possessed Arabella. 
---
when she had searched the house
---
If, let! she said. 
---
she will
 be kind enough
---
she quickly recovered and.


---
she said,. 
---
her mouth quivering and
---
her
 tears flowing
---
she allowed
---
She has
 never been other than yours, Jude-- in a proper sense. 
---
If it is
 this meretricious contract with Arabella which has been called doing
 the right thing! 
---
a woman in your state of feeling is quite beyond all
 appeals to her brains
---
you are humbugging yourself, as
 so many women do about these things; and
---
She turned
 off quickly.


---
Her bosom began. 
---
she burst out, and
---
she turned back
 impulsively. "
---
She rushed up to him and,
---
The words struck her like a blow, and
---
she bent her head. 
---
she gasped presently. 
---
She ran up the church to the east end, and
---
she requested
---
she had not
 seen
---
As she
 heard, and
---
even now unsubdued by her fetters
---
in a last
 instinct of human affection, she
 sprang up. 
---
she knelt down again, and
.


---
which still contained
 Sue

IX


 stood Arabella. 
---
She looked him up and down.


---
to see her she asked.


---
said she. 
---
a fellow, to see a particular woman, and
---
I have seen her for the last time, and
!"

"
---
she often did now before bedtime
---
Sue was muddling helplessly in the kitchen,, and.


---
she was not a good
 housewife,
---
she tried
---
No woman ought."


---
when Mrs. Edlin put on her bonnet and shawl
---
Half an hour later to
 leave Sue seemed.


---
" No-- no-- she implored,.


---
her eyes enlarged, and

---
She then fastened up the doors, and
---
Wait here Mrs. Edlin said Sue. 
---
Leaving the widow on the landing Sue turned to the chamber. 
---
She then arose,
 and. 
---
She
 wished Mrs. Edlin good- night, and
---
the widow entered the room that Sue
 had just vacated.


---
again she half opened
 the door, and
---
the word came out of her mouth
---
As she
 visibly shuddered.


---
Sue seemed relieved, and. 
---
she asked.


---
she gasped. 
---
I forgot HER-- and God!"


---
Sue had dragged herself back. "
---
when she was
 alone
---
she
 whispered."
---
She waited a moment, and! 
---
She had been intending
---
a contrite woman always keeps back a little
---
She went on:
---
She swore.

"
---
she crouched before him in her night- clothes
---
her to lift her up
---
Sue started back.


---
A quick look of
 aversion passed over her face, but.


---
she uttered
 no cry
---
when she said to herself:"
---
Sue had disappeared
---
Arabella saw. 
---
said Arabella. 
---
who said Arabella
 indignantly. 
---
Calling a respectable married woman by the name of
 that-- She remembered herself and
---
when she saw
---
how very little she had
---
But in the course of time, to fear from Sue's rivalry she had a fit of
 generosity. 
---
" to see your-- Sue she said. 
---
You can have her here."


---
She has chosen her course. 
---
Mrs. Edlin came, quite
 on her own account. 
---
Jude's wife, had reached absolute indifference by
 this time. 
---
how Sue was,
---
Sue had told him
---
She's begun it
 quite lately-- all of her own free will."


---
When did she begin?
---
she insisted."

"
---
Sue, my Sue-- fool is almost more than I can
 endure!... 
---
-- don't be frightened at my rambling-- I've
 got to talk to myself lying here so many hours alone she was once
 a woman whose intellect was to mine like a star to a benzoline lamp:
 who saw all MY superstitions as cobwebs that she could brush away
 with a word. 
---
her intellect
 broke, and
---
she veered round to darkness. 
---
she loathes
---
they met with brought reaction in her
---
The lanky form was that of
 Physician Vilbert, who had been called in by Arabella.


---
She's not in at present, but."


---
she'll be here soon
---
Arabella inquired and. 
---
" she said. 
---
She brought him a bottle and a glass, and
---
Arabella began. 
---
Laughing again she said:
"
---
Do n't do n't she whispered,.
---
She let him out of the house, and
---
she went back
---
as she said to
 herself:" Well! 
---
Weak women must provide for a rainy day. 
---
Arabella was at the looking- glass curling
 her hair, which operation she performed by heating an umbrella- stay
 in the flame of a candle and. 
---
she had lighted,
---
When she had finished this
---
, practised a dimple, and
 put on her things she cast. 
---
Arabella, hatted, gloved, and ready sat down and.


---
They made her restless, and
---
at last she said to herself:"?"


---
She looked again at Jude,
---
she
 had done so many times during the late months, and
---
she slipped from the room
---
which moved Arabella
---
She shut the front door, and
 and
---
She entered under the archway of Oldgate College, where
 men were putting up awnings round the quadrangle for a ball in the
 hall that evening. 
---
Arabella walked along the
 gravel paths and under the aged limes. 
---
When she moved on.


---
Meanwhile Arabella to discover,
. 
---
She nodded to one workman and another, and.


---
having a spin there with a fellow's arm round my
 waist she said to one of the men. 
---
When she reached home
---
she was met at the door by Stagg, and one or
 two other of Jude's fellow stoneworkers. 
---
, thank you said Arabella.


---
to go said she. 
---
could! She looked longingly down the street. "
---
she entered. 
---
When she reached the bedroom
---
she
 found.


---
she said impatiently. 
---
However she brightened,. 
---
she saw
,
---
her to start
---
she
 went to the bed. 
---
She touched his fingers
---
She listened at his chest. 
---
the faint notes
 of a military or other brass band from the river reached her ears;
 and
---
she exclaimed,"! 
---
she went to the door
---
Here she is!"
---
she said
 hurriedly.


---
said Arabella. 
---
a band in red uniform gave out the
 notes she had already heard in the death- chamber. 
---
she regarded the lively scene
---
While somebody touched
 Arabella in the ribs, and
---
looking round she saw Vilbert.


---
She did not reply. 
---
Vilbert's arm stole round her waist,. 
---
she kept her
 eyes on the river.


---
she did not know of the embrace
---
she would have laughed heartily at the horse- play
 that succeeded, if the imprint on her mind's eye of a pale,
 statuesque countenance she had lately gazed upon had not sobered her
 a little.


---
Arabella exclaiming," Dear, dear
---
more and more
 impatiently it had just occurred to her mind
---
who being
 pressed close against her by the throng
---
she got up
 into the street Arabella hastened on, forbidding the physician to
 accompany her further that day
---
She did not go straight to her
 house; but to the abode of a woman who performed the last necessary
 offices for the poorer dead; where she knocked.


---
she said. 
---
Arabella waited a few minutes; and
---
the two women went along,.


---
" said Arabella.

---
was Arabella, on the other the
 Widow Edlin. 
---
" said she.


---
said Arabella.


---
murmured the old woman.


---
she
 will come
---
she asked.


---
She swore."


---
How is she looking?"


---
when
 you saw her last. 
---
she
 ca n't stomach un, even now!"


---
her know
---
she's found forgiveness
 somewhere
---
She said!

"
---
she had found peace
---
She may swear that on her knees to the holy cross upon her necklace
 till she's hoarse, but!
---
said Arabella. 
---
She's

---
she left his arms, and
---
again she's
