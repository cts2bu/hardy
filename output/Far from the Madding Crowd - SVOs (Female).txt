wherein they become united again, in the character of
 prejudice, by the influence of a wife and family
---
said the girl, in a soft, though
 not particularly low voice.
---
" I heard a noise I could
 not account for when we were coming up the hill."

---
" I'll run back."

---
" Then I heard."" she answered.

---
The girl on the summit of the load sat motionless,
,
.
---
There was also a cat in a willow
 basket, from the partly- opened lid of which she gazed
 with half- closed eyes, and affectionately- surveyed the
 small birds around.

---
The handsome girl waited for some time idly in her
 place, and
---
Then she looked attentively downwards.
---
She
 turned her head.

---
her- eyes crept back to
 the package.
---
, her thoughts seeming
---
At length she drew the article into her
 lap, and
---
in which she proceeded to
 survey herself attentively
---
She parted her lips and
.

---
the sun lighted up to a
 scarlet glow the crimson jacket she wore, and painted
 a soft lustre upon her bright face and dark hair.
---
The
 myrtles, geraniums, and cactuses packed around her

---
She blushed
 at herself, and
---
Woman's prescriptive
 infirmity had stalked into the sunlight, which had
 clothed it in the freshness of an originality.
---
There was no necessity whatever for her looking
 in the glass.
---
She did not adjust her hat, or.
---
that any such intention had been her motive in

---
She simply observed herself as a
 fair product of Nature in the feminine kind,.
---
her thoughts
 seeming though likely dramas in
 which men would play a part-- vistas of probable
 triumphs--
---
She
 put the glass in the paper, and the whole again into its
 place.

---
she says
---
she wo n't pay any more."
---
the young woman pass
---
;
 she heard his words, and.

---
The redjacketed and dark-
 haired maiden seemed, and.
---
for she carelessly
 glanced over him
---
She
 might have looked her thanks to Gabriel on a minute
 scale, but
---
she did not speak them
---
; more probably she
 felt none, for in gaining her a passage he had lost her
 her point, and
---
how women take a favour of
 that kind
---
" That's a handsome maid
---
she has her faults."
---
The place contained two women and two cows.
---
One
 of the women was past middle age.
---
Her companion was ap-

---
She wore no bonnet or het, but.
 
---
if she recovers

" I do hope. I have
 I do n't mind break-
."
 " I wish," she said.
 
---
her long back being mathematically level
---
" I think," said the
" Yes, aunt; and
---
I'll ride over for it as soon as it is light."

---
" I can ride on the other: 
---
in which
 Nature, like a busy mother, seems

her
 children smile
---
By one of those whimsical coincidences to spare a moment
 from her unremitting labours to turn and make, the girl now dropped the cloak, and

They placed the calf beside its mother again,.

A GIRL ON HORSEBACK-- CONVERSATION


 THE sluggish day began.
---
soon
 there appeared in view an auburn pony with a girl on
 its back,
---
She was the young woman of the night before.

---
; possibly she had come to
 look for it.
---
She came up and.
---
The girl,, looked around for
 a moment,,.
---
The
 rapidity of her glide into this position was that of a
 kingfisher-- its noiselessness that of a hawk.
---
Thus she passed under the level boughs.

---
, she began.
---
She had
 no side- saddle, and
---
that a firm
 seat upon the smooth leather beneath her was un-

---
Springing to her accustomed
 perpendicular like a bowed sapling, and satisfying her,
 self, she seated herself in the
 manner demanded by the saddle,.

---
An hour passed, with a bag of bran in front of her.
---
, the girl returned, properly

---
On
 nearing the cattle- shed she was met by a boy bringing
 a milking- pail, who held the reins of the pony whilst

---
she slid off.
---
she
 would follow in leaving the hill
---
She came, the pail in one hand,.
---
There was a bright air and manner
 about her now,
---
by which she seemed;
 and
---
that the
 desirability of her existence could not be questioned
---
that she saw
---
she now presented
 him with
---
The adjustment of the farmer's hazy conceptions of her
 charms to the portrait of herself was less a diminution than a difference.
---
She seemed tall, but
---
, she could have been not
 above the height to be chosen by women as best
---
From the contours of her
 figure in its upper part, she must have had a beautiful
 neck and shoulders; but
---
since her infancy nobody had

---
Had she been put into a low dress

---
she would have run and.

---
Yet she was not a shy girl by any means
---
; it was merely
 her instinct.

---
to have a tickling effect upon virgin faces
 in rural districts; she brushed hers with her hand,.
---
the free air of her previous movements was
 reduced at the same time to a chastened phase of
 itself
---
said she, and,
---
She was surprised.
---
she said.

---
" I was here."

---
I'm lately come to this place."

---
" she inquired,; but
---
" I wanted my hat this morning.
---
" she went on.

---
" I had."

---
" I saw you!"

---
Where?" she inquired, a misgiving bringing every
 muscle of her lineaments and frame to a standstill.
, and all down
 the hill.
---
she had

---
when passing through the trees was suc-
 ceeded in the girl by a nettled palpitation, and that by
 a hot face.
---
It was a time to see a woman redden who
 was not given to reddening as a rule
---
when she would recover coolness sufficient to

---
She had gone away.

---
The young
 woman came regularly, but.
---
she appeared.
---
The
 young girl with the remarkably pleasant lips and white
 teeth was beside him.
---
She seemed, but of too insignifi-
 ca nt a kind to start enjoyment.

---
" Nothing now', she answered,"."

---
" I gave ten
 pounds for that hut.
---
But I'll sell it, and!
---
she ob-

---
her to be that novelty
 among women-- one who finished a thought before
 beginning the sentence which was to convey it
---
should I think,
---
" Yes I suppose."
---
I should
---
she knew his impressions
---
She made, and
---
the girl, smiling, and

---
" O no," the girl replied.
---
She seemed and
---
she shunned it.

---
I believe
---
"-- I do n't know
 your name.
---
I know your aunt's, but not yours."

---
I would just as soon not tell it--
---
" Still, I should like."

---
" You can inquire at my aunt's
---
-- she will tell you."

---
I
 must make the most of it."

---
" I always think."

---
" I should think."

---
" Well Miss- excuse the words- I thought
---
But I ca n't match you
---
I know in
.
---
I never was
 very clever in my inside.
---
But I thank you.
---
She hesitated, somewhat disconcerted at Oak's old-
 fashioned earnest conclusion.
---
she said, and.

---
" I am sorry."
---
She gave him her hand again.

---
" said she, though with-
 out pulling it away"
---
But I suppose?
---
" I was n't thinking of any such thing."
---
She snatched back her hand.

---
she said, teasingly; and

---
This well- favoured and comely girl soon made appre-
 ciable inroads upon the emotional constitution of young
 Farmer Oak.

---
that the girl's name
 was Bathsheba Everdene, and
---
Bathsheba Everdene
 came up the hill no more.
---
she had worn on the hill
---
Bathsheba's aunt was indoors.
---
" Will you tell Miss
 Everdene?
---
that somebody would be glad to speak to
 her
---
Bathsheba was out.
---
she might like one to rear
---
; girls do."

---
" She might," said Mrs. Hurst, musingly;
---
" though
 she's only a visitor here.
---
,
 Bathsheba will be in."

---
Yes, I will wait
---
if she'd like
---
if she would
---
if she's got
---
she's so good- looking, and
 an excellent scholar besides
---
-- she was going
---
to be a
 governess once,, only she was too wild.
---
, Lord, in the
 nature of women, she must have a dozen!"

---
It was
 Bathsheba Everdene.
---
--" she said,
---
" I have just called
---
she said.
---
I did n't know

---
I should have come
 in from the garden instantly.
---
I ran--
--"
 Gabriel expanded."I'm sorry to have made you
 run so fast, my dear."
---
that my aunt made a mistake in sending you away from
 courting me-- -- 
---
as times go with women
---
when she had eased her side by pressing
 it there, was prettily extended upon her bosom to still
 her loud- beating heart
---
Bathsheba had overtaken him at a point beside which
 stood a low stunted holly bush, now laden with red
 berries.
---
Seeing threatening a possible enclosure, if not compression, of
 her person, she edged off round the bush.

---
she said, over the top,,
---
" she said
 eagerly, and yet half conscious of the absurdity of the
 position she had made for herself--"
---
as my aunt said
---
; I hate.
---
though possibly I shall be had
 some day
---
if I'd wanted you
---
Why, I should n't have
 run after you like this;'!
---
Well, I am not quite certain

---
whether I wanted
---
she observed, rather more timor-
 ously
---
if I can think out of doors
---
Bathsheba looked thought-
 fully into the distance, away from the direction in which
 Gabriel stood.

---
" I can make you happy
---
Her countenance fell, and
---
she was silent awhile.

---
Bathsheba decisively turned to him.

---
she said.
---
" I do n't want."

---
" I have tried hard all the time I've been thinking
---
I had won my
 battle
---
I should feel triumphant, and all that,
 But a husband-- -- --
" Well!"

---
whenever
 I looked up
---
what I mean
---
that I should n't mind
---
if I could be one without having
 a husband
---
But since a woman ca n't show off in that
 way by herself
---
, I sha n't marry-- at least yet."

---
At this criticism of her statement Bathsheba made
 an addition to her dignity by a slight sweep away
 from him.

---
" Upon my heart and soul, I do n't know."
---
what a
 maid can say stupider than that
---
" she said,.
"
---
Because I do n't love you
---
" Yes, but-- --"
 She contracted a yawn to an inoffensive smallness,
.
---
I do n't love
 you.
---
"" she said.
---
" But I love you-- and,."

---
as for myself, I am content
 to be liked
---
she said with a little distress, and
."
---
H(ow I wish!"
---
I had n't run
 after you
---
However she seemed, and.
---
I want

---
; I am too independent; and

---
" she said,
---
I have
 hardly a penny in the world--
---
I am staying with my
 aunt for my bare sustenance.
---
I am-- and
---
I do n't love you a bit
---
Bathsheba was

---
she said, almost angrily, if not quite, an enlarging red
 spot rising in each cheek.

---
" I ca n't do--
---
I think
---
" she
 exclaimed, with even more hauteur, and."
---
I could
 marry you
---
Not if I know it."

---
Because I am open enough to own what
 every man in my shoes would have thought of
---
I have
 heerd, a large farmer-- much larger than ever
---
I shall
 be
---
May I call in the evening, or
---
I do n't want at once, if you'd rather not."

---
" No-- no-- I can not.
---
I do n't love you--
---
that Bath-
 sheba Everdene had left the neighbourhood
---
that she was gone
---
all that Oak learnt
 of Bathsheba's movements was done indirectly.
---
that she had gone to a place called Weatherbury,
 more than twenty miles off,
---
what would she have

---
where Bathsheba had gone
 two months before
---
Bathsheba had probably left Weatherbury long before
 this time, but
---
" Be as' twill, she's a fine handsome body as far's
 looks be concerned.
---
But that's only the skin of the
 woman, and
---
She's a very vain feymell
---
, I ca n't look her in
 the face. as I be" Yes-- she's very vain.'
---
that every night at
 going to bed she looks in the glass
---
And how do she play?"

---
that they might
 be speaking of Bathsheba
---
the woman alluded.
---
said the woman on foot.
---
I
 declare!
---
The young woman on the pony rode out from the
 shade and.

---
she said.

---
" said
 the second woman,.

---
I think so
---
the young woman on
 horseback, looking up at Gabriel through her thick
 woollen veil
---
" I wish.
---
the girl on horseback," go to him
, and
---
She delivered her
 message.

---
" That's she, back there upon the pony."
---
She lifted the wool veil tied round her face, and

---
Bathsheba did not speak, and
---
A TIMID GIRL


 BATHSHEBA withdrew into the shade.
---
She scarcely
 knew.

---
she was not, and
---
she" remembered
.

---
she had nearly forgotten it
---
" Yes," she murmured,
---
to speak to the bailiff, said
 Bathsheba.

---
Men." said
 Bathsheba,".
---
Bathsheba then rode off into the darkness, and
---
with which the unpractised girl
 of Norcombe had developed into the supervising and cool
 woman here
---
But some women only require an emerg-
 ency.

---
It was a slim girl, rather thinly clad.

---
" said the girl to Gabriel.

---
" I'll thank you?"
---
if I'm in the way for
 Warren's Malthouse
---
--" The girl hesitated and."
---
She seemed",.

---
" I do n't know.
---
" Yes-- --" The woman again paused.
---
There was
 no necessity for any continuance of speech, and the fact
 that she did add more seemed to proceed from an
 unconscious desire to show unconcern by making a
 remark, which is noticeable in the ingenuous when they
 are acting by stealth.
---
""
 she said, timorously.

---
" I am not.
---
I am the new shepherd--
---
She may have

---
for she said
 coaxingly
---
" I wo n't if you wish me not to."
---
Then she was silent and shivered.

---
She extended her hand;
---
It suggested a
 consumption too great of a vitality which, to judge from
 her figure and stature, was already too little.

---
The young girl remained motionless by the tree, and

---
when she was speaking
 to me
---
Yes-- mother was
 concerned to her heart about it-- yes.
---
I kneeled
 down and, and then the Belie
 right through, and then the Ten Commandments, in
 earnest prayer. then I went on with Dearly Beloved Brethren, and,
 I, this makes four, and' tis all I know out of
 book and I'm a
 lost man. when I got to Saying After Me, I
 rose from my knees and."
   what sort of a mis'ess is she to
 work under?"
---
" We d' know little of her-- nothing.
---
She only
 showed herself a few days ago.
---
,
 she's going.
  
---
Nater requires her
, or
---
she's not herself; and

---
if she
 had the good fortune to get into Heaven
---
she was a lovely woman.
---
she's ticketed as my lawful
 wife
---
she was only his sweetheart, and
 not married to him at all.
---
" Amen" said Everdene, quite absent-

---
she'd have growed up such a handsome body.
---
as she is
---
her temper is as good as her face
---
Bathsheba see
---
she's my vocation now
---
that after Miss
 Everdene got home
---
she went out again, and.
---
as she usually do
---
She fleed at him  like a cat-- never
 such a tomboy as she is--
---
She fleed at him, and,
---
" Fanny Robin-- Miss everdene's youngest servant--
 ca n't be found.
---
she is n't come in.
---
They would n't be so concerned if she
 had n't been noticed in such low spirits these last few
 days, and.
---
" Well-- Miss Everdene wants.
---
What with this trouble about
 the baily, and now about the girl, mis'ess is almost wild."
  
---
" she said anxiously.
  
---
if they have seen
 such a person as Fanny Robin
---
She must have left whilst

---
" Tomorrow morning I wish two or three of you." I beg yer pardon, but" I do n't know." said Bathsheba.
  
---
I've never heard of any such thing, ma'am
---
The most mysterious
 matter connected with her absence-- indeed, the only
 thing-- is."
  
---
that she was
 seen
---
" And, ma'am, excusing my words, that a
 young woman would hardly go."
---
"-- she would
 not, ma'am.
---
"
  " She had, a bundle,."
---
But she had no
 young man about here.
---
Bathsheba said.
  
---
" No, mistress; she was very close about it."
  
---
" Perhaps I might be able to find out."
---
if I went to
 Casterbridge barracks
---
if she does n't return tomorrow, mind

---
she
 has come to no harm through a man of that kind
---
I feel more responsible than I should if she
 had had any friends or relations alive. I do hope....
 but I ca n't speak of him now. Bathsheba had so many reasons for uneasiness that
 it seemed she did not think it worth while to dwell
 upon any particular one."
---
Do, then"
 she said in conclusion,.
  
---
from which the conversation proceeded,
 Bathsheba and her servant- companion,
---
Liddy, the maltster's
 great- granddaughter, was about Bathsheba's equal in
 age, and
---
her face was a prominent advertisement of the
 features'.
---
Though elastic in
 nature she was less daring than Bathsheba, and occa-

---
To
 think of her was
---
to get good- humoured; to speak of
 her was.
  
---
said Bathsheba
 through the door to her.
---
" I hear something."
  
---
" What impertinence!" said Liddy, in a low voice.

---
I see the
 top of his hat."
 " Be quiet!" said Bathsheba.
  
---
The further expression of Liddy's concern was.
  
---
said she,.
  
---
." said Bathsheba.
  
---
Liddy held up her hands and arms,.
  
---
" said Bathsheba,

---
which
 had lain in her bosom a minute or more
---
Is Miss Everdene at home
---
", Bathsheba
 said at once--
  
---
" I ca n't see him in this state.
---
Whatever shall I do?"
  
---
Not- at- homes were hardly naturalized in Weatherbury
 farmhouses, so Liddy suggested--"."
  
---
" Miss is dusting bottles, sir, and
---
returned the
 answer as requested, adding, however, on her own
 responsibility, is quite
 a object-- that's why' tis."
  
---
if anything had been heard
 of Fanny Robin
---
William
 Smallbury is gone to Casterbridge, where her young
 man lives,, and
---
said Bathsheba.
  
---
" Forty, I should say-- very handsome-- rather stern-
.
---
I am always in
 some unfortunate plight or other complainingly.
---
," Bathsheba said,

---
as she had no friends in her childhood
---
-- all the girls,
 gentle and simple, for miles round, have tried him.
---
" I've got a pen- nee!
---
"?" said Liddy.
  
---
She is a staid woman
---
, is n't she, my little man
---
said Bathsheba,
.'
---
" Ay, mistress-- so I did.
---
But what between the poor
 men I wo n't have, and the rich men who wo n't have me,

---
I stand as a pelicon in the wilderness!"
  
---
Liddy
 ventured.
---
" em, i daresay.?"
 
---
Bathsheba paused, as if about to refuse a reply, but

---
since it was really in her
 power
---
the temptation to say yes, was irresistible by aspiring virginity, in spite of
 her spleen at having been published as old.
  
---
" she said, in a highly experi-
 enced tone and the image of Gabriel Oak,.
  
---
!" said Liddy, with the fixed
 features of mental realization
---
" I seem.

---
I hear it
---
" No, sir-- I'm your better." or
---
But I rather liked him."
  
---
I hear
---
Liddy looked from a back window into the courtyard
 behind,.
---
Two or three women in pattens brought up the rear.
  
---
said Liddy,.

till I am dressed

followed by Liddy

CHAPTER X



 HALF- AN- HOUR later Bathsheba, in finished dress,


 and, entered the upper end of the old
 hall.
---
She sat
 down at a table and.
---
From this
 she poured a small heap of coin.
---
Liddy chose a
 position at her elbow and.
  
---
before I begin
---
, have you heard anything of
 Fanny?
---
she had gone there
---
nobody
 had seed her.
---
said Bathsheba,
.
---
" I daresay.

---
Well, now then"-- she looked into the book--" Joseph
 Poorgrass,?"
  
---
-- ma'am I mane
---
" I be the personal name of Poorgrass."
  
---
In the eye of other people
 -- well, I do n't say it;."
  
---
I do do
---
in seed time I
 shoots the rooks and sparrows, and.
---
-- ma'am I mane."
  
---
as I am a new comer
---
Bathsheba blushed slightly at the sense of being
 generous in public, and
---
who had drawn
 up towards her chair
---
How much do I owe you-- that man in the corner
---
I shall
 not hurt you."" Matthew Moon mem" said Henery Fray, correct-
 ingly, from behind her chair,.
  
---
Are they satisfactory women?
---
" Yes-- I see." she
 inquired softly of Henery Fray.
  
---
Bathsheba summarily speaking, and

---
said a woman in the
 back quarter, who had just entered with clicking pattens.
  
---
" What woman is that?"
---
Bathsheba asked.
  
---
" I be his lawful wife!"
---
This lady
 called herself five- and- twenty,.
---
She was a woman who never,
 like some newly married, showed conjugal tenderness in
 public, perhaps because she had none to show.
  
---
" said Bathsheba."
---
" said again the shrill tongue
 of Laban's lawful wife.
  
---
" Well, he can speak for himself, I suppose. the wife replied
  " Heh- heh- heh!"
---
" Now I think."
---
I have done with you
---
said Bathsheba,
.

---
she cried her heart out about it almost.
---
She was

---
But perhaps her air was
 the inevitable result of the social rise which had advanced
 her from a cottage to a large house and fields.
---
" said Bathsheba, as William,
 after marching to the middle of the hall
---
I should have been sooner
---
said Bathsheba.

---
" Well, ma'am, in round numbers, she's run away with
 the soldiers."
---
she's gone after him
---
said Bathsheba.
---
She then rose; but
---
to which her
 mourning dress added a soberness that was hardly to

---
I do n't yet know my powers or my talents in farming;
 but
---
I shall do my best, and
---
, so
 shall I serve you.
---
I hope not)
---
because I'm a woman
---
that
 I do n't understand the difference
 between bad goings- on and good
---
What
 girl are you?"

---
" Your wife, Fanny Robin."
" Fanny!" said the wall, in utter astonishment.

---
" Yes." said the girl, with a half- suppressed gasp of
 emotion.

---
There was something in the woman's tone which is
 not that of the wife, and
---
There are bad women about, and
---
When she passed the
 corner
---
A RULE-- IN EXCEPTION


 THE first public evidence of Bathsheba's decision to
 be a farmer in her own person and by proxy no more

---
Among these heavy yeomen a feminine figure glided,
 the single one of her sex that the room contained.
---
She
 was prettily and even daintily dressed.
---
She moved
 between them as a chaise between carts,,.
---
It had required a little
 determination-- far more than she had at first imagined
 -- to take up a position here, for at her first entry the
 lumbering dialogues had ceased, nearly every face had
 been turned towards her, and those that were already
 turned rigidly fixed there.

---
to these she had made her
 way.
---
if she was
---
she had

---
But to be the practical woman intended to show herself, business must be carried on,
 introductions or none, and
---
she ultimately acquired con-
 fidence enough to speak and reply boldly to men merely
 known to her by hearsay.
---
Bathsheba too had her
 sample- bags, and
---
in the keenly pointed corners of her
 red mouth when, with parted lips, she somewhat
 defiantly turned up her face
---
But her eyes
 had a softness-- invariably a softness-- which, had they
 not been dark,.
---
she always allowed
---
her interlocutors to finish their state-
 ments before rejoining with hers
---
In arguing on prices,
 she held to her own firmly,,
 and.
---
But there was an elasticity in her firmness
 which removed it from obstinacy, as there was a naivete
 in her cheapening which saved it from meanness.

---
with whom she had no dealings
 by far the greater part
---
Who is she?
---
The reply would be--
" Farmer Everdene's niece
---
she'll do
 everything herself
---
she's so headstrong.
---
to be proud of her here-- she
 lightens up the old place.'
---
that she'll soon get picked up
---
that the novelty of
 her engagement in such an occupation had almost as
 much to do with the magnetism her face and movements
---
whatever
 it may have been to Bathsheba as the buying and selling
 farmer
---
this Saturday's debut in the forum,, was unquestionably a triumph to her as the
 maiden.
---
that
 her instinct on two or three occasions was merely to
 walk as a queen among these gods of the fallow, like a
 little sister of a little Jove, and to neglect closing prices
 altogether
---
The numerous evidences of- her power to attract were

---
Women seem.
---
Bathsheba, without looking within
 a right angle of him, was conscious of a black sheep
 among the flock.

---
It perplexed her first.
---
If nobody had regarded her
---
, she would
 have-- taken the matter indifferently
---
, she would
 have taken it as a matter of course
---
She soon knew thus much of the recusant's appear-
 ance.
---
Bathsheba was.

---
, she rushed off to Liddy,
.
---
who was waiting for her-- beside the yellowing in which
 they had driven to town
---
on they trotted Bathsheba's sugar, tea, and drapery
 and.

---
" I've been through it, Liddy, and" I knowed." Liddy said"."

---
The information was put
 in this form that Liddy might not for a moment suppose
 her mistress was at all piqued.
---
she continued," upright
---
"; about forty, I should
 think.
---
Liddy could n't think.

---
" said Bathsheba with some
 disappointment.

---
I have n't a notion
---
Bathsheba was suffering from the reverse feeling just
 then, and
---
she said.

---
Liddy looked."
---
" murmured Bathsheba, and

---
as if Bathsheba and her charms
 were thin air
---
" she
 remarked.

---
" I wonder.
---
A woman jilted him
---
women scarcely ever jilt men
---
I expect."

---
-- I expect so
---
I--  should n't wonder after all-- just between the two-- rather cruelly
 used and rather reserved."

---
" O dear no, miss-- I ca n't think it between the
 two!"

---
I am.

---
Bathsheba's new piano,, looked.
---
Liddy, like a little brook, though
 shallow, was always rippling;
---
her presence had not so
 much weight as to task thought, and yet enough to
 exercise it.

---
Liddy looking at it
---
; I do."

---
said Bathsheba,."
---
Liddy fetched it.
---
I wish.
---
" she
 said, on returning."
---
The special verse in the Book of Ruth was sought out
 by Bathsheba, and
---
the sublime words met her eye.
---
Folly in the
 concrete blushed, persisted in her intention, and.
---
" Now keep steady, and be silent." said Bathsheba.

---
;
 Bathsheba blushed guiltily.

---
said Liddy curiously.

---
" I shall not tell you."

---
, miss?"Liddy continued, the track her thoughts had taken.

---
." said Bathsheba, with serene indifference

---
" I know it."

---
Certainly I did not
---
, I tell you."

---
Liddy assumed a smaller physiognomy, and.

---
Bathsheba said perforce.

---
" I did n't ask him to.
"
---
Bathsheba dropped into a silence intended to ex-
 press that she had opinions on the matter too abstruse
 for Liddy's comprehension, rather than that she had
 nothing to say.

---
" Dear me-- I had nearly forgotten the valentine
 I bought yesterday.
---
" she exclaimed at length.
" Valentine!
---
who for, miss?" said Liddy.
---
It was the single name among all possible wrong
 ones that just at this moment seemed to Bathsheba
 more pertinent than the right.

---
I'll direct it at once."

---
Bathsheba took from her desk a gorgeously illumin-
.
---
said Bathsheba.
---
" What
 shall I put?"

---
" Something of this sort, I should think',
---
returned
 Liddy promptly: --

---
said Bathsheba.
---
She inserted the
 words in a small though legible handwriting;.

---
to send it to the stupid old
 Boldwood" said the
 irrepressible Liddy, contem-

---
as she thought
 of the moral and social magnitude of the man
---
Bathsheba paused.

---
She was far from being
 seriously concerned about his nonconformity.
---
that a girl like Liddy should talk about it
---
So
 Liddy's idea was.

---
said the persistent Liddy.

---
" Really, I do n't care particularly."
---
said Bathsheba, idly.
---
Bathsheba, a small yawn upon her mouth, took the
 pen, and
---
I remember,
 but
---
I ca n't read it.
---
Bathsheba looked
 closely at the hot wax.

---
she exclaimed,."'
---
Of love as a spectacle Bathsheba had a fair knowledge;

---
but of love subjectively she knew nothing.




 CHAPTER XIV



 EFFECT OF THE LETTER--
---
was the letter Bathsheba had sent.

---
; her unrevealed eyes had

---
as she formed it
---
her brain had

---
Why should
 she have imagined him?
---
Her mouth-- were the lips
 red or pale, plump or creased?--
---
The vision of the woman writing, as a supplement to

---
She was a
 misty shape, and
---
well she might be,.

---
that
 her original was at that moment sound asleep and
 oblivious of all love and letter- writing under the sky
---
she took a form, and com-

---
It is for Miss Everdene's.
---
" And how is she getting on without a baily?"
---
She'll rue it-- surely, surely!"
---
she can carr' on alone!
---
what she is
---
what's
 under her bonnet
---
" She can
 spaik real language, and
---
what a farmer- woman can want with a
 harpsichord, dulcimer, pianner, or whatever' tis
---
" What have you been saying about her?"
---
her have rope enough
---
you've been speaking against her
---
that
 she's no worse
---
At the same
 time, Miss Everdene has a right to be own baily if
 she choose-- and to keep me down to be a common
 shepherd only."
---
" And she do n't even let,
---
she's took against ye
---
you are interested
 in Fanny Robin
---
she is so confident
 of has not yet come
---
, she should remember-- and.
---
she gives no address
---
His mother was a French
 governess, and
---
that a secret attachment existed
 between her and the late Lord Severn
---
She was
---
if ever little Fanny will
 surprise us in the way she mentions-- very much doubt

---
that henceforth the lambs belonged to Farmer
 Bathsheba Everdene, and to no one else
---
" Where's the woman?"
---
where the woman is
---
The women threw off their
 nervousness, and
---
The women were impressed, and
---
; every
 woman in the church was waiting, and

---
she asked blankly.

---
" I do n't go through that experience again for some
 time
---
, I warrant you!"

---
" But after all." she expostulated in a trembling voice,
"!
---
turning from her walked rapidly away
---
When women are in a freakish
 mood
---
that Bathsheba was fated today
---
wood women had been remote phenomena rather than
 necessary complements-- comets of such uncertain
 aspect, movement, and permanence,
---
Was she really beautiful?
---
Is Miss Everdene
---
" O yes; she was a good deal noticed the first
 time she came,.
---
And this charming woman had in effect said to
 him,".
---
" Why should she have done that
 strange thing?
---
well matched
 by Bathsheba's insensibility to the possibly great issues
 of little beginnings
---
She was at this moment.
---
It
 was evident that such a nature as his had no attraction
 for a woman of Bathsheba's taste.
---
This could be done, but only
 in one way-- by asking to see a sample of her corn.

---
All this time Bathsheba was conscious of having
 broken into that dignified stronghold at last.
---
, she knew,
---
, such a
 triumph would have been the sweeter to her for this
 piquing delay.
---
she valued it.

---
only as she
 valued an artificial flower or a wax fruit
---
wherein her heart was not involved
---
Being a woman with some good sense in reasoning
 on subjects, Bath-
 sheba genuinely repented.

---
that a freak as much to Liddy as to herself, should
 ever have been undertaken,
---
she respected too highly
---
She that day nearly formed the intention of begging
 his pardon on the very next occasion of their meeting.

---
she ridiculed him
---
she wanted
---
, it would read
 like additional evidence of her forwardness.





---
Bathsheba was far from dreaming.
---
upon which she had so carelessly thrown a
 seed
---
Had she known
 Boldwood's moods
---
, her blame would have been fearful,
 and the stain upon her heart ineradicable.
---
Moreover,
 had she known her present power for good or evil over
 this man
---
, she would have trembled at her responsibility.

---
Luckily for her present, unluckily for her future tran-
 quillity, her understanding had not yet told her.
---
Beyond the first enclosure
 was a hedge, and on the other side of this a meadow
 belonging to Bathsheba's farm.

---
They were those of Miss Everdene,
 Shepherd Oak, and Cainy Ball.

---
When Bathsheba's figure shone upon the farmer's
 eyes
---
No mother existed to
.
---
whenever
 an ewe has lost her own offspring, one of the twins of

---
another ewe being given her as a substitute
---
whilst Bathsheba was holding open a little pen of four
 hurdles, into which the Mother and foisted lamb were
 driven, where they would remain till the old sheep

---
Bathsheba looked up at the completion of the
 manouvre, and.
---
to whom her face was as the uncertain glory of an April
 day
---
As for Bathsheba, she was not deceived into the
 belief that Farmer Boldwood had walked by on business
 or in idleness.
---
She collected the probabilities of the
 case, and.
---
that she was herself responsible for
 Boldwood's appearance there
---
It troubled her much
.
---
Bathsheba was no schemer for marriage, nor

---
was she deliberately a trifler with the affections of men,
 and
---
a censor's experience on seeing an actual flirt after
 observing her would have been a feeling of surprise
 that Bathsheba could be so different from such a one,
 and
---
She resolved never again, by look or by sign,.
---
She was
 not at home."
---
, her probable whereabouts was out- of- doors at
 this time of the year.
---
whilst she still lived
 and
---
she was at the sheepwashing
---
Bathsheba was standing by in a new riding- habit--
 the most elegant she had ever worn--.
---
the reins of her
 horse being looped over her arm
---
that she could not but think
---
bade her good- morning, with
 such constraint stepped across to the washing for its own sake, hoping
 not to find her there; more, she fancied his brow severe
 and his eye slighting.
---
Bathsheba immediately contrived
.
---
till she was
 a stone's throw off
---
She heard footsteps brushing the
 grass, and.
---
Instead of turning or waiting,
 Bathsheba went further among the high sedges, but

---
" Miss Everdene!" said the farmer.

---
She trembled,."

---
she had

---
is the reverbera-
 tion of thunder, so did Bathsheba's at her intuitive
 conviction.

---
" I feel-- almost too much--."."
---
Bathsheba tried, and
---
she made
---
she stammered.

---
Bathsheba answered nothing, and
---
the mare upon
 her arm seemed so impressed that instead of cropping
 the herbage she looked up.

---
" I think and!"
   
---
Bathsheba's momentary impulse at hearing this was
.

---
that, till she remembered
---
" I wish."
---
I could say courteous flatteries to you
---
I have neither power
 nor patience to learn such things.
---
I want you for my
 wife-- so wildly that no other feeling can abide in me;
 but
---
I should not have spoken out."

---
had I not been led

---
she
 said to herself, but not a word to him.
  
---
so that I do n't know-- but
---
I mean my meaning
---
how to answer you with
 propriety and respect am only just able to speak
 out my feeling--; that I am afraid
 I ca n't marry you, much as I respect you.
---
I did n't
---
-- I know
---
I ought never
---
-- it was a
 wanton thing which no woman with any self- respect
 should have done.
---
lessness, I promise never to-- --"

---
to say-- I never thought of it in that light, and

---
I ca n't endure it.
---
I wish!

---
I knew
---
that I ca n't do
---
but-- I can only ask.
---
if I have already got
 you
---
If I have not, and
---
as I have to you
---
, I can say no
 more."
  
---
" I have not fallen in love with you, Mr. Boldwood--

---
certainly I must say that."
---
She allowed a very small
 smile to creep for the first time over her serious face in
, and
---
I fear, but.
---
I am too old for you
---
I will take
 more care of you
---
I will protect and
---
cherish you with all my strength
 -- I will indeed!
---
-- I can afford it
---
I rather cling
---
I will sell it, and.
---
I can not say how
 far above every other idea and object on earth
---
Bathsheba's heart was young, and
---
I can not bear you, and
---
And I am afraid they
 will notice us, Mr. Boldwood.
---
I can not think collectedly.
---
I did not know

---
O, I am wicked to
!"
---
She was.
  
---
" I can do nothing.
---
I can
---
" Yes."
" I may think of you?"

---
" Yes, I suppose."

---
" I will call upon you again to- morrow."

---
" Yes-- I will give you any time."
---
And then she turned away.
---
Bathsheba mused.

---
Bathsheba, not being the least in love with him, was
 eventually able to look calmly at his offer.
---
It was one
 which many women of her own station in the neighbour-
 hood, and not a few of higher rank, would have been
 wild to accept and proud to publish.
---
that she, a lonely girl, should marry, and
---
Had she felt,, any wish whatever for the married state in the
 abstract, she could not reasonably have rejected him,
 being a woman who frequently appealed to her under,
 standing for deliverance from her whims.
---
which she did
 not
---
: she esteemed
 and, yet.
---
she did not want him
---
that ordinary women
 accept husbands
---
But the understood incentive
 on the woman's part was wanting here.
---
But a disquiet filled her.
---
which was somewhat to her
 credit,
---
with which she combated her objections
---
Beyond the men-
 tioned reasons,
 she had a strong feeling that, having been the one who
 began the game
---
, she ought in honesty.
---
She said in the
 same breath.

---
that she could n't do it
---
Bathsheba's was an impulsive nature under a delibera-
 tive aspect. 
---
An Elizabeth in brain and a Mary Stuart
 in spirit, she often performed actions of the greatest
 temerity with a manner of extreme discretion.
---
Many of
 her thoughts were perfect syllogisms
---
she found

---
looked upon them in
 silence for a minute or two; then she said--

---
I'll turn the winch of the grindstone.
---
I want.

---
Bathsheba took the handle.

---
Bathsheba turned
 the winch, and
---
Bathsheba felt
 the unpleasant symptoms after two or three dozen
 turns.
  
---
she said.
---
I ca n't talk.

---
Bathsheba then began, with some
 awkwardness,.
  
---
her thoughts to stray occasion-
 ally from her story
---
" I wanted?"
  
---
" she said again.

---
" I thought so by the look of them!
---
I want!
---
what I came for
---
" she
 continued.

---
" Well, then, Bathsheba!" said Oak,.
  
---
" Miss Everdene,," she said, with dignity.
  
---
I mean this
---
that, I bain't going
---
I have already tried to please
 you too much for my own good!"

---
Bathsheba regarded him with round- eyed perplexity.

---
She did not know--.
  
---
With Bathsheba a hastened act was a rash act
---
that she valued as sounder than her own
---
At this period the
 single opinion in the parish on herself and her doings
 was Gabriel
 Oak's.
---
Knowing, she asked
 the question, painful as she must have known the sub-
 ject.
---
Such is the selfishness of some charm-
 ing women.
---
Perhaps it was some excuse for her thus
 torturing honesty to her own advantage,.

---
that she had
 absolutely no other sound judgment within easy reach
---
" I said I wanted I was going." I can say that to them Miss Everdene.
 And I could likewise give an opinion to' ee on what
 you have done."
" I daresay. But I do n't want."" Well, what is your opinion of my conduct.
---
" she
 said, quietly.

---
" That it is unworthy of any thoughtful, and meek,
 and comely woman."

---
But she forbore

---
the reticence of her tongue
 only made the loquacity of her face the more notice-
 able.

---
for I know
---
I thought
."

---
She instantly replied sarcastically--
"!"

---
that
 I see in your abuse the praise of discerning people
---
" I am glad you do n't mind it,."
  
---
Bathsheba had unmistakably
, and
---
She then broke out--
  ?
---
" I have
 long given up thinking of that matter."Or wishing it, I suppose." she
 said; and
---
it was
 apparent that she expected an unhesitating denial of
 this supposition.

---
A woman may be treated with a bitterness which
 is sweet to her, and with a rudeness which is not
 offensive.
---
Bathsheba would have submitted to an
 indignant chastisement for her levity
---
what she had been expecting, and
---
what she had not
 got
---
because the lecturer saw her in
 the cold morning light of open- shuttered disillusion

---
Bathsheba laid down the shears.
 
---
" I can not allow any man to--!"
---
she exclaimed."
---
It may have been a peculiarity-- at any rate it was
 a fact-- that when Bathsheba was swayed by an emotion
 of an earthly sort her lower lip trembled: when by a
 refined emotion, her upper or heavenward one.
---
, so I will
---
she, her
 eyes flashing at his
---
" she said, meeting
 them at the door just as she was coming out on her
 way to church, and ceasing in a moment from the close
 compression of her two red lips, with which she had
 accompanied the exertion of pulling on a tight glove.

---
With Bathsheba it was a moment--"
  
---
With Bathsheba it was a moment when thought was
 speech and speech exclamation.
---
Moreover, she had

---
which she had suffered from Oak's remarks
---
she cried,."
---
Her eyes were at their darkest and brightest now.

---
Bathsheba's beauty belonged rather to the demonian
 than to the angelic school
---
, she never looked so well as
-- and.

---
when she was angry
---
that her presence
 always gave them
---
Bathsheba, with a sad, bursting heart, looked at these
 primest specimens of her prime flock--
 Swoln with wind and the rank mist they drew.

---
said Bathsheba,
 helplessly.
---
I never
 knew."

---
she said, in a resigned tone.

---
she
 said excitedly.
---
" I told you never to allude to him, nor
 shall you if you stay with me.
---
Ah!" she added,
---
she stood alone with the dying flock.

---
she said firmly.

---
Bathsheba went up to it.
---
O, what shall I do
---
"-- what shall I do!"
---
she again
 exclaimed,.
---
" I wo n't send for him.

---
No, I wo n't!"

---
The" No, I
 wo n't" of Bathsheba meant virtually
---
," I think."

---
I must
---
She followed her assistants through the gate, and
.
---
Laban answered to her
 signal.

---
Bathsheba watched.
---
Bathsheba walked
 up and down.
---
Bathsheba continued.
---
She hoped.
---
that I say so" O, what folly!" said Bathsheba.

---
she said.

---
" Well?" said Bathsheba, unwilling to believe that
 her verbal lettre- de- cachet could possibly have miscarried.

---
Bathsheba turned aside, her eyes full of tears.
---
she was in through pride and shrewishness
---
: she burst out
---
she attempted no further concealment.

---
Bathsheba checked her grief and.

---
After this collapse, not very dignified for the head
 of an establishment, she went into the house,
---
Here she sat down and.
---
She held it at a distance,,!"

---
She looked a little redder in refolding it, and.
---
Bathsheba waited indoors for the result.

---
at which she had

---
although her first
 command had been so haughty
---
She went out, and.
---
A mounted figure passed between her and the
 sky, and.
---
It was a moment when a woman's eyes and tongue tell
 distinctly opposite tales.
---
Bathsheba looked full of
 gratitude, and
---
she said:--
  !"

---
She knew from the look which sentence in her
 note.
---
Bathsheba followed to the
 field.

---
,
 Bathsheba came and.

---
" she, said,
.

---
" I will.
---
And she smiled on him again.





---
Bathsheba, after throwing a glance here, a caution
 there, and lecturing one of the younger operators without re- stamping it with her initials, came
 again to Gabriel,
---
She blushes at the insult."
---
So the chatter was all on her side.
---
There is a
 loquacity that tells nothing, which was Bathsheba's;
 and
---
said Bathsheba,
.

---
that she was going to

---
which Bathsheba's
 presence had somewhat suppressed
---
she instinctively modulated her
 own to the same pitch, and
---
She was far from having
 a wish to appear mysteriously connected with him; but
 woman at the impressionable age gravitates to the larger
 body not only in her choice of words, which is apparent
 every day, but even in her shades of tone and humour,
 when the influence is great.
  
---
The issue of their dialogue
 was the taking of her hand by the courteous farmer to
.
---
Bathsheba demurely regarded a contemptible straw lying
 upon the ground, in a way which suggested less ovine
 criticism than womanly embarrassment.
---
She became
 more or less red in the cheek, the blood wavering in
 uncertain flux and reflux over the sensitive space between
 ebb and flood.
---
She left Boldwood's side, and
---
Then she
 reappeared in her new riding- habit of myrtle- green, which
 fitted her to the waist as a rind fits its fruit; and young

---
; Bathsheba
 instantly gazed towards it, and.

---
she exclaimed, with severe remon-
 strance you who are so strict with the other men--!"

---
Bathsheba to be
 well aware that she herself was the cause of the poor
 ewe's wound
---
because she had wounded the ewe's shearer
 in a-- still more vital part
---
she again spoke out to Oak
 with the same dominative and tantalizing graciousness.

---
why a maid should take a
 husband
---
when she's bold enough
---
for' tis keeping another
 woman out
---
As usual with decided characters, Bathsheba invari-
 ably provoked the criticism of individuals like Henery
 Fray.
---
Her emblazoned fault was.
---
Henery Fray spoke, exhibiting miserable eyes at the
 same time:" I do n't see, and;." I
 once hinted my mind to her on a few things,. You all know,?"

---
That was n't too strong for her
---
her
 marry
---
an she will
---
Because she told me all that passed."
---
Bathsheba
 had shown indications of anointing him above his
 fellows by installing him as the bailiff that the farm
 imperatively required.
---
Far from coquetting with
 Boldwood, she had trifled with himself in thus feigning
 that she had trifled with another.
---
Miss Everdene sat inside
 the window,.
---
She was thus at
 the head without mingling with the men.

---
This evening Bathsheba was unusually excited
---
, her
 red cheeks and lips contrasting lustrously with the mazy
 skeins of her shadowy hair.
---
She seemed.

---
the seat at the bottom of the table was
 at her request left vacant the duties appertaining to that end, which he did
 with great readiness
---
So also was Bathsheba now.

---
" Faith, so she is;
---
" Now, Joseph, your song, please." said Bathsheba,
 from the window.

---
Bathsheba still remained inside the window, and.
---
from which she sometimes looked up
---
Whilst he was
 thinking of this, Liddy brought candles into the back
 part of the room overlooking the shearers, and
---
Bathsheba's form, still in its original position, was now
 again distinct between their eyes and the light,.

---
Would Miss
 Everdene sing to them the song she always sang so
 charmingly--" The Banks of Allan Water"-- before they
 went home?

---
After a moment's consideration Bathsheba assented,
.

---
" she whispered.

---
She stood up in the window- opening,.
---
Her singing
 was soft and rather tremulous at first, but
---
None was gay as she!

---
when the rest were all looking
 away that Boldwood observed her
---
when they regarded
 her
---
Bathsheba then wished them good- night,,.
---
produced by Bathsheba's
 voice
---
Miss Everdene and Boldwood were alone.
---
Her
 cheeks had lost a great deal of their healthful fire from
 the very seriousness of her position; but
---
her eye was
 bright with the excitement of a triumph--.

---
She was standing behind a low arm- chair, from which
 she had just risen, and he was kneeling in it-- inclining
 himself over its back towards her, and holding her hand
 in both his own.
---
which
 quenched much of the pleasure she derived from the
 proof that she was idolized
---
" I will try." she was saying, in a trembling
 voice quite unlike her usual self- confidence."
---
And if I
 can believe in any way that I shall make you a good
 wife I shall indeed be willing to marry you. I do n't want. I would rather ask you till I can see my situation better."But you have every reason to
 believe that then-- --"
" I have every reason to hope that at the end of the five or
 six weeks, between this time and harvest, that
 you say you are going to be away from home, I shall be
 able to promise to be your wife." she said, firmly."
---
But
 remember this distinctly, I do n't promise yet."

---
I do n't ask more
---
I can wait on
 those dear words.
---
" she said, graciously-- almost tenderly;
 and
---
Bathsheba knew more of him now
---
She had been and.
---
whether the sin quite deserved
 the penalty she was schooling herself to pay
---
To have
 brought all this about her ears was terrible; but after a
 while the situation was not without a fearful joy.
---
which Bathsheba had

---
voluntarily imposed upon herself by dispensing with the
 services of a bailiff
---
Women are never tired of bewailing man's
 fickleness in love, but
---
As watching is best done invisibly, she usually carried
 a dark lantern in her hand, and
---
This cool-
 ness may have owed its existence not so much to her
 fearlessness of expected danger as to her freedom from
 the suspicion of any; her worst anticipated discovery
 being that a horse might not be well bedded, the fowls
 not all in, or a door not closed.

---
she went round to the farm paddock.
---
Her way back to the house was by a path through a
 young plantation of tapering firs, which had been planted
 some years earlier to shelter the premises from the north
 wind.
---
her apprehen-
 sions of danger were not vivid enough to lead her to
.
---
Slipping along here covertly as
 Time, Bathsheba fancied enter-

---
she could hear footsteps
---
Her own instantly fell as gently as
 snowflakes.
---
She reassured herself by a remembrance
 that the path was public, and that the traveller was
 probably some villager returning home; regetting, at
 the same time, that the meeting should be about to
 occur in the darkest point of her route, even though
 only just outside her own door.

---
a figure was
 apparently on the point of gliding past her when some-
 thing tugged at her skirt and.
---
In recovering she struck against
 warm clothes and buttons.

---
" A rum start, upon my soul!" said a masculine voice,
 a foot or so above her head.
---
" Have I hurt you"
" No." said Bathsheba,.

---
", I think.
---
" Yes."
" Are you a woman?"

---
Bathsheba softly tugged again, but to no purpose.

---
, the
 rays burst out from their prison, and Bathsheba beheld
 her position with astonishment.

---
The contrast of this
 revelation with her anticipations of some sinister figure
 in sombre garb was so great that it had upon her the
 effect of a fairy transformation.

---
she hastily replied,
 and.

---
when she raised them
 for a moment
---
; Bathsheba looked down again,.
---
But she had obliquely noticed.

---
Bathsheba pulled again.

---
she exclaimed, helplessly."

---
She withdrew her own hand, but,.
---
Bathsheba was
 vexed
---
; she hardly knew why.

---
She looked at him again.

---
She coloured with embarrassment."'
---
" she replied, stiffly, and with as much
 dignity-- which was very little-- as she could infuse into
 a position of captivity
" I like you the better for that incivility, miss."
---
She pulled again,
 and
---
the gathers of her dress began.

---
But why should such a fair and dutiful girl have such
 an aversion to her father's sex?
---
she exclaimed, in high
 temper.
---
She closed her lips in a determined silence.

---
Bathsheba was revolving in her mind.
---
whether by a
 bold and desperate rush she could free herself at the
 risk of leaving her skirt bodily behind her
---
which she had

---
The dress-- put on to appear stately at the supper-- was the head
 and front of her wardrobe;
---
not another in her stock
 became her so well.
---
What woman in Bathsheba's
 position, not naturally timid, and within call of her
 retainers, would have bought escape from a dashing
 soldier at so dear a price?

---
said her cool friend.

---
, I perceive,"
" It is done in order that I may have the pleasure
 of apologizing to so charming a woman, which I
 straightway."
---
Bathsheba really knew.

---
She started up, and
---
She sidled off inch by inch,
 the lantern in her hand,.

---
till she could see the redness
 of his coat no longer
---
She made no reply, and,.

---
Liddy had just retired to rest.
---
In ascending to her
 own chamber, Bathsheba opened the girl's door an
 inch or two, and,,?"

---
There are
 occasions when girls like Bathsheba will put up with
 a great deal of unconventional behaviour.
---
Just now the first
 feeling was in the ascendant with Bathsheba, with a dash
 of the second.
---
So she could not clearly decide."

---
whether it was her
 opinion that he had insulted her or not
---
Clearly she
 did not think his barefaced praise of her person an
 insult now.

---
she was beautiful
---
to
 women lied like a Cretan-- a system of ethics above all
 others calculated to win popularity at the first flush of
 admission into lively society; and.

---
The wondrous power of flattery in passados at woman
 is a perception so universal as to be remarked upon by
 many people almost as automatically as they repeat a
 proverb, or.
---
who by deluging her with untenable
 fictions charms the female wisely, may acquire powers
 reaching to the extremity of perdition
---
A week or two
 after the shearing, Bathsheba, feeling a nameless relief
 of spirits on account of Boldwood's absence,.
---
In the first mead already loading hay, the women raking it into cocks
 and.

---
as she had entered the field
---
Bathsheba
 blushed with half- angry embarrassment, and.





---
Bathsheba was absolutely speechless.
---
And yet she
 could not help.

---
she said,
.
---
" I do n't allow."

---
that you are
 quite a common- place woman,
---
Bathsheba moved on.
---
she said, in a restless state between distress
 at hearing him and a penchant to hear more.

---
" I again say.

---
you are a most fascinating woman
---
I'm sure the fact is evident enough.
---
Miss Everdene,
 my opinion may be too forcibly let out,
 and, for the matter of that, too insignificant to convince
 you, but
---
Am I any worse for breaking the
 third of that Terrible Ten than you for breaking the
 ninth?"

---
that I am
 fascinating
---
" she replied evasively.

---
" Not so to you:  then I say with all respect.
---
, I mean to my face,."
---
she went on,
.

---
herself to be further lured into a conversation
 that intention had rigorously forbidden
---
" No-- that is-- I certainly have heard, but-- 
---
Liddy say

---
--" She paused.

---
well, Miss Everdene pardon my blunt
 way
---
" How-- indeed?" she said,.

---
I may as well be hung for
 a sheep as a lamb( an old country saying, not of much
 account, but
---
so I
 will speak my mind, regardless of your pleasure, and
 without hoping or intending to get your pardon.
---
She can marry him:

---
why I
 say that a woman so charming as yourself, Miss Ever-

---
dene, is hardly a blessing to her race."

---
she made no reply
---
she said simply.

---
I do---- and

---
when I have an opportunity, which latterly
 has not been often( my mother was a Parisienne)
---
" Ah!" she replied, and
---
there was even a little tremu-
 lousness in the usually cool girl's voice
---
And
 then poor Bathsheba instantly perceived her slip in

---
making this admission: in hastily trying to retrieve it,
 she went from bad to worse."
---
that I derive any pleasure from what you tell me
---
I know
---
"-- I know it perfectly."
---
"." said
 Bathsheba,
---
she was fitfully
.

---
" I would not own it to anybody else-- nor.
---
do I
 exactly to you
---
I
 knew
---
" Well, you need not think more of that: perhaps you
 did not mean to be rude to me by speaking out your
 mind: indeed, I believe." said the shrewd
 woman, in painfully innocent earnest."
---
And I thank
 you for giving help here.
---
unless
 I speak to you
---
for I shall not be
 here long
---
I am soon going back again to the miser-
 able monotony of drill-- and perhaps our regiment will
 be ordered out soon.
---
Well, perhaps generosity is not a woman's
 most marked characteristic."

---
"?" she asked, with
 some interest.

---
" Can you ask Miss Everdene----?
---
" I you do care so much for a silly trifle of that

---
kind, then, I do n't mind.
---
" she uncertainly and
 doubtingly answered."
---
I think."

---
I wo n't repeat the remark.
---
I
 am too gratified to get such a mark of your friendship
 at any price to cavil at the tone.
---
I do Miss Everdene,

---
I
 do n't know.
---
I am
 interested in knowing."

---
" she
 said,."
---
I am not, upon the honour of a soldier"

---
-- Of course I ask for mere pas-
 time."

---
I am so
 distracted."

---
" I am indeed."

---
I loved you then, at once--."

---
as I do now
---
Bathsheba surveyed him curiously, from the feet
 upward, as high as she liked to venture her glance,
 which was not quite so high as his eyes.

---
" she said demurely.

---
I wo n't
 listen to you any longer.
---
Hear me, I wish
---
I knew--
---
I am going--
---
I have wasted too much time
 here already!"

---
-- I am about to get a
 new one."

---
before she knew
---
And, a heavy gold watch was in her hand.

---
She did so.

---
she exclaimed, with round- eyed wonder."
---
which she held out persistently towards him
---
Bathsheba followed.

---
she said, in a perfect
 simmer of distress."
---
" I loved my father: good; but better
---
, I love you
 more.
---
how I can do it
---
Bathsheba was brimming with agitated bewilderment,
 and
---
she said, in half- suspicious accents of feeling,"!
---
: I may
 not be really so.

---
as I seem to you
---
I can not and.
---
I have

---
as she now stood--
 excited, wild, and honest as the day
---
she
 went on, unconscious of the transmutation she was
 effecting.

---
Bathsheba could not face the haymakers now.
---
, she retreated
 homeward, murmuring, O
---
saving the hay-- even Liddy had left the house for the
 purpose of lending a hand--
---
Bathsheba resolved.
---
She had dressed the hive
 with herbs and honey,
---
At once she heard, not ten yards off,
 a voice that was beginning to have a strange power in
 agitating her.
"
---
Miss Everdene, let
---
Bathsheba flung down the brush, crook, and empty
 hive,.
---
as well as she could
 slid down the ladder
---
By the time she reached
---
She found her voice in a minute.
---
she asked, in what, for a
 defiant girl, was a faltering way
---
"; though, for a timid
 girl, it would have seemed a brave way enough.

---
that her hat should be
 taken off--,
---
as she was
---
that, flurried, she could not avoid
---
Bathsheba looked on from the ground,

---
She made use of an unobserved minute
.
---
To hide her embarrassment during the unwonted
 process of untying the string about his neck, she said: --

---
" I have never seen."

---
Bathsheba hesitated.
---
She had heard wondrous
 reports from time to time by dwellers in Weatherbury,
 who had by chance sojourned awhile in Casterbridge,
 near the barracks, of this strange and glorious perform-
 ance,* tlie sword- exercise.
---
So she said mildly.

---
what she felt strongly
---
" Yes; I should like."

---
"
" Not with a walking- stick-- I do n't care.

---
" Yes, I know; and
---
I have no sword here; but
---
I
 think.
---
I could get one by the evening
---
!" said Bathsheba,.
---
She shook her head, but with a weakened negation.

---
If I were to
---
" she said,".
---
I must bring Liddy too
---
I do n't see.
---
An unconscious look of assent in Bathsheba's eyes
 betrayed.
---
her also feel
---
that Liddy Would be superfluous in
 the suggested scene
---
She had felt it, even whilst making
 the proposal.

---
" she added;" a very short
 time."

---
Bathsheba's dwelling extended, a
 mile off, into an uncultivated tract of land, dotted at
 this season with tall thickets of brake fern, plump and
 diaphanous from recent rapid growth, and radiant in
 hues of clear and untainted green
---
Bathsheba appeared in their midst, their soft,
 feathery arms caressing her up to her shoulders.
---
She
 paused,.

---
whence she cast a farewell glance upon
 the spot she had just left,
---
She saw a dim spot of artificial red moving round
 the shoulder of the rise.
---
She waited one minute-- two minutes-- thought of
 Troy's disappointment at her non- fulfilment of a promised
 engagement, till she again ran along the field,.
---
She
 was now literally trembling and
---
panting at this her
 temerity in such an errant undertaking; her breath
 came and, and
---
her eyes shone with an in-
 frequent light.
---
she must
---
She reached the
 verge of a pit in the middle of the ferns.
---
Bathsheba saw a sort of rainbow, upside down in
 the air, and
---
One,
 two-- --"
 She hurriedly interrupted: " I'd rather not
---
she said invincibly.

---
Bathsheba's adventurous spirit was beginning.

---
She took up her position,.

---
what I wish
---
" Now just to learn whether you have pluck enough
 to let, I'll give you a preliminary
 test."

---
of which she was
 conscious
---
that the point and blade of the sword
 were darting with a gleam towards her left side, just
 above her hip; then of their reappearance on her right
 side, emerging as it were from between her ribs, having
 apparently passed through her body
---
" Oh!" she cried out in affright,."
---
" I have not touched you."
---
In an instant the atmosphere was transformed to
 Bathsheba's eyes.
---
These
 circling gleams were accompanied by a keen rush that
 was almost a whistling-- also springing from all sides of
 her at once.
---
In short, she was enclosed in a firmament
 of light, and of sharp hisses,.

---
the space
 left untouched would have been almost a mould of
 Bathsheba's figure
---
Behind the luminous streams of this aurora militaris,
 she could see the hue of Troy's sword arm,;
---
she could see them individually.
---
before she had moved or
---
An arc of silver shone on her right side: the sword
 had descended.
---
she
 cried.

---
She saw,
 and.
---
the point glisten towards her bosom
---
Bathsheba closed her eyes in
 the full persuasion that she was killed at last.
---
ever, feeling just as usual, she opened them again.

---
said Bathsheba, amazed.

---
I merely gave point to your
 bosom."

---
She shuddered.
---
Bathsheba, abstractedly sat down on
 a tuft of heather.

---
She saw,.
---
She felt power-
.
---
Bathsheba seemed as one who, facing
 a reviving wind, finds it blow so strongly that it stops
 the breath.

---
and she saw.

---
That minute's interval had brought the blood beating
 into her face.
---
It had brought upon
 her a stroke resulting,.
---
She felt like
 one who has sinned a great sin.

---
the element of folly distinctly mingling
 with the many varying particulars which made up the
 character of Bathsheba Everdene
---
It was almost foreign
 to her intrinsic nature.
---
though she had too
 much understanding to be entirely governed by her
 womanliness
---
Bathsheba,, had too much womanliness to use her
 understanding to the best advantage.
---
Perhaps in no
 minor point does woman astonish her helpmate more
 than in the strange power she possesses of believing
 cajoleries.

---
she knows
---
she
 knows
---
Bathsheba loved Troy in the way that only self- reliant
 women love when they abandon their self- reliance.

---
When a strong woman recklessly throws away her
 strength
---
she is worse than a weak woman who has never
 had any strength to throw away.
---
One source of her
 inadequacy is the novelty of the occasion.
---
She has
 never had practice in making the best of such a
 condition.
---
Bathsheba was not conscious of guile in this matter.

---
Though in one sense a woman of the world, it was, after
 all, where a quiet family of rabbits or hares lives
 on the other side of your party- wall, where your neigh-
 bour is everybody in the tything, and where calculation
 formulated self- indulgence of bad, nothing at all.
---
her utmost thoughts in this direction been distinctly
 worded( and by herself they never were)
---
as that she felt

---
Her love was entire as a child's, and
---
Her culpability lay in
.
---
her making no attempt to control feeling by subtle and
 careful inquiry into consciences
---
She could show others
 the steep and thorny way, but
---
The difference between love and respect was mark-
 edly shown in her conduct.
---
Bathsheba had spoken of
 her interest in Boldwood with the greatest freedom to
 Liddy, but
---
she had only communed with her own heart
.

---
An opportunity occurred one evening when she had
 gone for a short walk by a path through the neighbour-
 ing cornfields.
---
her pass
---
she said.
---
" I thought,
---
I would come
---
when
 she had brushed somewhat quickly by him
---
She walked on without turning her head,
 and
---
for many steps nothing further was heard from her
 quarter than the rustle of her dress against the heavy
 corn- ears.
---
Then she resumed rather tartly--
."

---
she returned quickly.

---
Bathsheba would probably have terminated the con-
 versation there and
---
her conscious weakness of position allured her

---
" she said
 very emphatically,".
---
I am glad of the opportunity of
 clearing up a mistake which is very common and very
 provoking
---
I did n't definitely promise Mr. Boldwood
 anything.
---
I have never cared for him.
---
I respect him,
 and
---
But I have given
 him no distinct answer.
---
As soon I shall

---
that I can not think of
 marrying him
---
Bathsheba's steps became faintly spasmodic.
---
" Why?"
 she asked.

---
" she said, intractably."
---
Yet I must say
.
---
" I can not see.
---
" I believe.
---
And I
 can not help.
---
I do n't say
---
as I have fancied
---
-- I
 pray to God.
---
I ask you."

---
" I like soldiers, but this one I do not like.
---
is ruin to the woman.
---
detained by a window- pane ever
 pulsed as did Bathsheba now
---
she exclaimed desperately.
---
" she said eagerly,".
---
how entirely she trusted him
---
But Bathsheba, dear mistress, this
 I beg you."

---
" she exclaimed, in a choking
 voice.

---
she
 could not really forgive him for letting his wish to marry
 her be eclipsed by his wish to do her good, any more
 than for his slighting treatment of Troy.

---
she commanded,."
---
" she said decisively.

---
But mind this, I do n't wish
.
---
What I do
---
,
 I do.
---
Sometimes I say
---
I should be as glad as a bird to

---
I'm content to be a
 nobody
---
I was made for better things.
---
However, I
 do n't like
---
I hate, but,
---
I own to being rather interfering.
---
who she is that I
 like too well, and!"

---
that she privately and un-
 consciously respected him a little for this grim fidelity,
 which had been shown in his tone even more than in
 his words
---
At any rate she murmured something to the
 effect.
---
She said more
 distinctly,
---
I do n't
 order it as a mistress-- I ask it as a woman, and
---
I
 expect."

---
Certainly I will, Miss Everdene."
---
her to get far ahead of him
---
A figure apparently rose
 from the earth beside her.
---
an hour later Bathsheba entered her own house.

---
There burnt upon her face.
---
when she met the light of
 the candles the flush and excitement which were little
 less than chronic with her now
---
who had accompanied her to the very door
---
It is only fair to Bathsheba after-

---
she had

---
She now sank down into a chair, wild and perturbed
 by all these new and fevering sequences.
---
Then she
 jumped up with a manner of decision, and.

---
In three minutes, without pause or modification, she
 had written a letter to Boldwood, at his address beyond
 Casterbridge,
---
that she had well

---
saying mildly but firmly considered the whole subject kindly given her time to decide upon; that her
 final decision was.
---
that she could not marry him
---
She
 had expressed to Oak an intention to wait till Boldwood
.
---
But Bathsheba found.

---
that she could not wait
---
, she
 arose.

---
She paused in the passage.
---
Bathsheba and Troy were the
 subject of it.

---
", she'll gie up farming."

---
Bathsheba had too much sense to mind seriously
 what her servitors said about her; but
---
She
 burst in upon them.

---
" she asked.

---
At last
 Liddy said frankly,"."

---
" I thought so!
---
now I forbid you.
---
I do n't care the least for Mr. Troy-- not I. Every-

---
how much I hate him
---
said Liddy;" and
---
" I hate him too."
---
O you perjured woman!
---
" said Bathsheba, excitedly.

---
I have no right to hate him, nor you, nor anybody.

---
But I am a silly woman!
---
I do n't care for him
---
; I don"t

---
She flung down the letter and.

---
Liddy following
 her
---
" O miss!" said mild Liddy,.
---
" I am sorry we mistook you so!
; but
---
I see."

---
Liddy closed the door, and.
---
I'll make answer hencefor'ard,
"
---
;"
 I'll say it out in plain black and white."

---
Bathsheba burst out: "?
---
Are you a woman yourself?"

---
Liddy's clear eyes rounded with wonderment.

---
she said,
 in reckless abandonment and grief."
---
O, I love him
 to very distraction and misery and agony!
---
though perhaps I am enough to frighten
 any innocent woman
---
She put
 her arms round Liddy's neck.
---
I must let it out to
 somebody
---
that a woman
 thinks nothing of perjury
---
I want."

---
Liddy went towards the door.

---
how can I say--
---
She
 started off,.

---
I do n't--
---
I know!"
---
said
 Liddy, frightened at Bathsheba's unwonted vehemence.

---
I suppose.
---
" I do n't know
---
said Liddy, be-

---
If I say No
---
if I say Yes
---
" I do n't believe."

---
My poor life and heart,
 how weak I am!"
---
she moaned, in a relaxed, desultory
 way, heedless of Liddy's presence."
---
how I wish I

---
Loving is misery for women
 always.
---
I shall never forgive God for making me a
 woman, and
---
dearly am I beginning."
---
She freshened and."
---
Mind this, Lydia Smallbury,, I'll never trust you, or love
 you, or have you with me a moment longer-- not a
 moment!"

---
" I do n't want."
---
said Liddy, with
 womanly dignity of a diminutive order;" but I do n't
 wish to stay with you.
---
And,, I'll go at the
 end of the harvest, or this week, or to- day....
---
I do n't
 see!"
---
that I deserve
---
concluded the small woman, bigly.

---
said Bathsheba,

---
Dear, dear-- I do n't know
---
what I
 am doing since this miserable ache
---
What shall I come
 to!
---
I suppose.
---
I shall get further and further into
 troubles
---
I wonder sometimes.
---
if I am doomed
---
I am friendless enough
---
" I wo n't notice anything, nor
---
will I leave you!"
---
Liddy, impulsively putting up her lips to Bathsheba's,
 and.

---
Then Bathsheba kissed Liddy, and
---
I do n't often cry
---
", do I,?
---
" she said, a smile shining
 through the moisture."
---
" I will, miss, indeed."

---
I am afraid that's how I am.
---
that I have been crying about him,
---
I'll always be your
 friend."
---
" I think
---
" Indeed I do."

---
I fancy

---
said Bathsheba, slightly laughing,
 though somewhat seriously alarmed by this Amazonian
 picture of herself.
---
I hope?
---
I am not a bold sort of
 maid-- mannish
---
"" she continued with some anxiety.

---
" she
 said, after having drawn her breath very sadly in and

---
," I wish.'
---
I had half your failing
 that way
---
THE next evening Bathsheba, with the idea of getting
 out of the way of Mr. Boldwood in the event of his
 returning to answer her note in person, proceeded to

---
Bathsheba's companion, as a gage of their
 reconciliation, had been granted a week's holiday.
---
that Miss Everdene should honour them by coming
 there for a day or two to inspect some ingenious con-

---
Leaving her instructions with Gabriel and Maryann,
 to see the night, she went out of the house just at the close of
 a timely thunder- shower, which had refined the air, and
.
---
Before her, among the
 clouds, there was a contrast in the shape of lairs of
 fierce light which showed themselves in the neighbour-
 hood of a hidden sun, lingering on to the farthest north-
 west corner of the heavens that this midsummer season
 allowed.

---
She had walked nearly two miles of her journey,
.
---
when she beheld the very man she sought so anxiously to elude
---
That Bathsheba was
 a firm and positive girl, far less inconsequent than her
 fellows,
---
that these qualities would lead her, and
---
" she faltered, a guilty
 warmth pulsing in her face.

---
she turned a little aside
---
?" said Bathsheba.

---
I fancied.
---
She regained self- possession,.

---
she
 murmured.
---
Bathsheba was unable to direct her will into any
 definite groove for freeing herself from this fearfully
 and.
---
" Bathsheba-- darling-- is it final indeed?"

---
" O, Bathsheba-- have pity upon me!"
---
Still, she is
 you
---
-- she is you."

---
Bathsheba commanded herself well.
---
But she could
 hardly get a clear voice for what came instinctively to
 her lips
---
:" There is little honour to the woman in that
 speech.
---
In her noon- clear sense that she had never
 loved him.
"
---
she forgot for a moment her thoughtless angle
 on that day in February
---
Bathsheba, you are
 the first woman of any shade or nature that I have ever
 looked at to love, and
---
she
 earnestly said.

---
She checked emotion,.
---
Mr. Bold-
 wood, I promised you nothing
---
Would you have had
 me a woman of clay?
---
when you paid me that furthest,
 highest compliment a man can pay a woman-- telling
 her he loves her
---
I was bound.
---
How was I
---
I was contented
---
Bathsheba, in spite of her mettle, began.
---
that she was inherently the weaker
 vessel
---
She strove miserably against this feminity
 which would insist upon supplying unbidden emotions
 in stronger and stronger current.
---
She had tried to
 elude agitation by fixing her mind on the trees, sky, any
 trivial object before her eyes,
---
ingenuity could not save her now.

---
I did not take you up
---
"-- surely I did not!
---
" she
 answered as heroically as she could."
---
I can endure!
---
I am in
 the wrong
---
If I have lost
---
,
 how can I be?
---
as if I had won
---
Had I known.
---
, how would I have avoided you,
 and
---
I tell you
 all this, but
---
She returned silent and weak denials to his charges,
 and.

---
" Dearest, dearest, I am wavering even now between
 the two opposites of recklessly renouncing you, and
 labouring humbly for you again.
---
I do n't possess half
 the warmth of nature you believe me to have.
---
You are not the cold woman you
 would have me believe.
---
The swift music of her heart became hubbub now,
 and
---
she throbbed to extremity.
---
She delayed the reply, but.
---
" she whispered.

---
the woman not
 gained.
---
she glided
 from him, without obviously moving,,"

---
as she said
---
" I am
 only a girl--
---
-- this is woman's folly
 indeed!"

---
She fired up at once.
---
"" she said, vehemently.
---
I have nobody in the world; but
---
Yet say things against me, I WILL
 NOT be put down!"

---
The most tragic woman is cowed by a tragic man,
 and
---
,
 nearly her own self rendered into another sex,
 Bathsheba's cheek quivered.
---
She gasped,"
---
I am nothing to you.
---
" I shall not."

---
," she said, slowly, and,
---
" I am not ashamed to speak the truth
---
she implored in a miserable cry.
---
Bathsheba,, flung her hands to her face,
 and.
---
Instead of being a man trained to
 repression-- what she had seen him.

---
The force of the farmer's threats lay in their relation to a
 circumstance known at present only to herself:.
---
her lover was

---
She felt wretchedly certain that if he revisited her just at
 this nick of time, and came into contact with Boldwood, a
 fierce quarrel would be the consequence.
---
She panted with
 solicitude when she thought of possible injury to Troy.
---
With almost a morbid dread of being thought a gushing
 girl, this guileless woman too well concealed from the world
 under a manner of carelessness the warm depths of her strong
 emotions.
---
In fer
 her distraction, instead of advancing further she
 walked up and down,.
---
Then she sat down on a heap of stones by
 the wayside to think.
---
There she remained long.
---
the unresting world wheeled her round to a contrasting
 prospect eastward, in the shape of indecisive and palpitating
 stars.
---
She gazed upon their silent throes amid the shades of
 space, but.
---
Bathsheba's crannied and mouldy halls were to- night
 occupied only by Maryann, Liddy being, as was stated,
 with her sister, whom Bathsheba had set out to visit.

---
A few minutes, Maryann turned
 in her bed with a sense of being disturbed.
---
She was
 totally unconscious of the nature of the interruption to
 her sleep.
---
She left her bed and.
---
in the paddock she could just discern by
 the uncertain gray a moving figure approaching the
 horse that was feeding there.
---
Here she could see some object which circum-
 stances proved to be a vehicle for after a few minutes
 the horse down the road, mingled with the sound of
 light wheels.

---
They were a woman and a gipsy man.
---
A woman
 was out of the question in such an occupation at this
 hour, and
---
She
 hastily slipped on her clothes,
---
our Dainty- i'll swear to her step
---
she comes back!"
---
when she was at home
---
what's she between two of us?-
---
" Old Jimmy Harris only shoed her last week, and

---
drove her at starting, we shall catch'em yet."

---
how she was
 driven up this hill
---
" She walked up here--
 and
---
well she might.
---
On hearing his voice she had turned her face away
 from the light.
---
Bathsheba it certainly was, and
---
she had by this time

---
she could do so well
---
she inquired quietly,"?"

---
" she said,."
---
taking for her own
 use the assurance that Gabriel lacked
---
that I had taken the trap and horse
---
I could

---
though
 I hammered for ten minutes against her window- sill
---
Fortunately, I could get the key of the coach- house, so

---
I troubled no one further.
---
must n't a lady move an inch from her door without being
 dogged like a thief?
---
" I did leave an account-- and
---
I wrote in chalk on the coach- house
 doors that I had come back for the horse and gig, and
;."

---
that I could arouse nobody, and should
 return soon
---
" she said,
---
she had
 too much sense to blame them long or seriously for a
 devotion to her that was as valuable as it was rare.

---
She added with a very pretty grace,"
---
Well, I really thank
 you heartily for taking all this trouble; but
---
I wish Mr. Boldwood's."

---
" lt was only a stone in her shoe.
---
She turned her head-- the gateman's candle
 shimmering upon her quick, clear eyes as she did so--
 and.

---
" She wo n't be in Bath by no daylight!"

---
Bathsheba's perturbed meditations by the roadside
 had ultimately evolved a conclusion that there were only
 two remedies for the present desperate state of affairs.

---
Could she give up this new love-- induce
 him?

---
she did not like him
---
her and Weather-
 bury no more
---
for a while she
 contemplated it firmly,.

---
as girls will, to dwell upon the happy life she would
 have enjoyed
---
; for she had penetrated
 Troy's nature so far,
---
She jumped to her feet.
---
She would see him at once.

---
Yes, she would implore him by word of mouth.
---
that
 by adopting this course for getting rid of him she was

---
The only way to accomplish her purpose was.
---
the journey was a fearfully heavy one, even for a strong
 horse, at her own estimate; and she much underrated
 the distance.
---
But could she go on to Liddy's and?
---
she turned back
 towards the village.

---
Her walk was slow,
---
for she wished
---
Her plan was now
,
---
, she thought),

---
By this arrangement she could trot Dainty gently all
 the day,--
---
she had been to Bath
 at all
---
Such was Bathsheba's scheme.
---
But in her topo-
 graphical ignorance as a late comer to the place, she
 misreckoned the distance of her journey as not much
 more than half what it really was.
---
Her idea, however,
 she proceeded.





---
was there any explanation of her Gilpin's
 rig
---
which had called her mistress to Bath
---
that the
 business still
 detained her there
---
that she hoped.

---
"" said
 Maryann, who with some other women was tying the
 bundles(," but

---
the corn was Bathsheba's
---
Mother says!"

---
she once
 was crying a'most to death.
---
And her eyes were shining and
---
she was as white as a lily;
 and
---
You are sure' twas she?

---
" Miss Everdene and the soldier were walking about
 together
---
she wore a beautiful gold- colour silk
 gown, trimmed with black lace,.'
---
her hair was brushed splendid.

---
she'll wish her cake

---
if so be she's over intimate with that man.
---
She's not over intimate with him."
---
" She would know better."
---
that the woman was Miss Everdene
---
whose sweetheart she is
---
since she ca n't be
 yours
---
It was
 Miss Everdene's gig, and
---
Liddy and her mistress were
 the only occupants of the seat.
---
Liddy was asking
 questions about the city of Bath, and her companion
.
---
Both
 Bathsheba and the horse seemed weary.

---
that she was here
 again, safe and sound
---
inside the room was Bathsheba,
.
---
that she had returned
---
Liddy's manner
 was odd, but
---
She went in,, and
---
in her absence the blind of the
 room containing Bathsheba was pulled down.
---
Liddy came out.

---
" she said.

---
she had denied him an entrance
 there now.

---
" she might have become en-
 gaged to you."

---
you might have been married to Fanny
---
Well, there's too much difference between Miss Ever-
 dene's station and your own for this flirtation with her
.
---
Bathsheba is only

---
playing with you: you are too poor for her
---
Fanny shall have fifty,, and
---
where she is living
---
as I said she shall have five hundred
 paid down on her wedding- day."

---
if,,
 Miss Everdene is out of my reach
---
But
 she's only a servant."

---
if you like her best
---
Miss Everdene inflamed me, and.
---
" Bathsheba-- out alone at this time o' night!" said
 Boldwood in amazement, and.
---
" Why must
 you meet her?"

---
" She was expecting me to- night-- and I must now
 speak to her, and wish her good- bye, according to your
 wish.
---
" I do n't see the necessity of speaking."

---
she'll be wandering about
 looking for me if I do n't.
---
You shall hear all I say to her.

---
when I am gone
---
if she does not know

---
, she will think more about me

---
than if I tell her flatly
---
I have come
---
Shall I hear every word you say?
---
The tones were
 Bathsheba's.

---
she continued, tenderly."
---
" she said, playfully;
" and
---
I've packed them all off so

---
Liddy wanted, and
---
she might stay
 with them till
---
whilst I fetch it" Yes." She turned and.

---
to give her up and
 can not marry her said the soldier, mockingly.

---
" Oh, how can she be saved now,?"

---
how the land
 lies with Bathsheba
---
She must love you
 indeed.
---
as she
 has done
---
Wretched woman-- deluded woman-- you
 are, Bathsheba!"

---
" Bathsheba is a woman well to do."
---
she will make a
 good wife; and,
---
indeed, she is worth your hastening
 on your marriage with her!"

---
" But she has, and
---
pray do n't desert her,
 Troy."

---
No; she would n't have it of me.
---
But she must know
 nothing of this cash business."

---
" First we'll call upon her."

---
But she must be consulted
---
They went up the hill to Bathsheba's house.
---
Fanny has long ago left me.

---
where she is
---
You say; yet
 on the merest apparent evidence you instantly believe
 in her dishonour.
---
you love Bathsheba
---
" She has married him!"
---
that she had had a fearful journey to Bath,
---
her miscalculating the distance
---
that she had been more than two
 days getting there
---
It was not Bathsheba's way to do
 things furtively.
---
With all her faults, she was candour
 itself.
---
Could she have been entrapped?
---
Her quiet return
 with liddy had to some extent.

---
too that,, to put the best face upon the matter would be the
 greatest kindness to her he loved
---
" Perhaps she's not there."

---
said the clear voice
 of Bathsheba, who stood at the inner end of the build-
 ing, observing the scene from behind a table covered
 with cups and viands.
---
said the sergeant
 gaily, taking Bathsheba by the hand and leading her
 to the top of the dance.
---
" For though I have pur-
 chased my discharge from Her Most Gracious Majesty's
 regiment of cavalry the11th Dragoon Guards, to attend
 to the new duties awaiting me here, I shall continue a
 soldier in spirit and feeling as long as I live."
 It has been observed in the musical circles
 of Weatherbury and its vicinity."
---
Bathsheba put her hand upon his arm, and, with
 upturned pale face
---
Bathsheba indignantly left the barn,.
---
followed by
 all the women and children
---
what this direct message from the Great Mother
 meant
---
By this hurried contrivance
 Bathsheba's property in wheat was safe for at any rate
 a week or two,.

---
Could it be that of the only venturesome woman in
 the parish-- Bathsheba?
---
" Who is there?" said the voice of Bathsheba,
" Gabriel.
---
Liddy is afraid to come out.
---
she said, resolutely.
---
She instantly
 took a sheaf upon her shoulder,.
---
At her third ascent the rick suddenly brightened
 with the brazen glare of shining majolica-- every knot

---
she exclaimed, and.
---
Bathsheba was on the ground
 now, and
---
she bore its dazzle
 without flinching-- thunder and ali- and again ascended
 with the load.
---
Bathsheba said nothing; but
---
She descended the ladder, and,
---
Bathsheba appeared
---
said Bathsheba."
---
she said,.
---
I am a timid woman and
---
" I am not certain."
---
It was Bathsheba's breath
---
-- she had followed him, and
.

---
She followed, but without a sheaf
" Gabriel.
---
" she said, in a strange and impressive voice.

---
She had not spoken since

---
Bathsheba was
 sitting almost on the apex of the stack
---
, her feet gathered
 up beneath her, and.

---
grieved and
 troubled-- --" She cleared her voice, and."
---
" she whispered
 with desperate impetuosity.

---
she quickly added.

---
She went down the ladder, and
---
said Bathsheba,
---
she said, gratefully.!
---
night- i know."

---
She diminished in the gloom, and and
---
as she passed through
---
which
 had caused speak as warmly as she chose
---
her to speak more warmly to him to- night

---
than she ever had done whilst unmarried and free to

---
that there was
 not, as some fancy, any jilting on-- her part
---
" O no-- I do n't think that."
 : she never
 promised me!"
---
no woman
 ever had power over me for any length of time.
---
One Saturday evening in the month of October
 Bathsheba's vehicle was duly creeping up this incline.

---
She was sitting listlessly in the second seat of the gig,
 whilst walking beside her in farmer's marketing suit
 of unusually fashionable cut
---
" said Bathsheba, sadly?
---
--
 her voice was painfully lowered from the fulness and
 vivacity of the previous summer--"
---
" she implored.
---
Bathsheba
 was at the full depth for tears, but
---
she maintained a
 dry eye.

---
I do n't see
---
why I should; in fact, be a fine day
---
", I was thinking of taking you.
---
I'll go a hundred miles the other
 way first.
---
I hate the sound of the very word!"

---
she exclaimed, with an
 agonized look.

---
, I'd never have."

---
- i know what
---
A flash of indignation might have been seen in
 Bathsheba's dark eyes.
---
as she looked resolutely ahead
 after this reply
---
A woman appeared on the brow of the hill.
---
so that she was very near the
 husband and wife
---
before she became visible
---
whilst putting
 his foot on the step- the woman passed behind him.

---
, Bathsheba could
 see plainly enough to discern the extreme poverty of
 the woman's garb, and the sadness of her face.

---
The woman said these words to Troy over his
 shoulder.

---
The woman, on hearing, quickly looked
 up,.
---
Her face was drawn
 into an expression which had gladness and agony both
 among its elements.
---
She uttered an hysterical cry,
 and.

---
he woman made no answer.

---
After advancing the distance, Bathsheba turned her head.
---
The
 woman was upon her feet, and
---
Bathsheba saw, and.
---
her
 withdrawing from Troy
---
who that woman was
---
she, with angry hauteur,
 and still regarding him
---
" I do."" Who is she?"

---
that frankness would
 benefit neither of the women
---
" What is her name?"

---
the woman walked on
---
she strained.
---
her eyes to look
 afar upon the naked road, now indistinct amid the
 penumbrae of night
---
she opened a gate
 within which was a haystack.
---
Underneath this she sat
 down and presently slept.

---
When the woman awoke
---
Towards this weak, soft glow the woman
 turned her eyes.

---
If I could only get there" she said.
---
Perhaps I
 shall be in my grave before then."

---
she carefully scanned the fence
.
---
as she slowly walked along
---
She drew her fingers across its face.

---
" Two more!" she said.

---
For a slight distance she bore up bravely,
.
---
Now
 there was not a rustle, not a breeze, not the faintest
 clash of twigs to keep her company.
---
The woman
 looked over the gate,.
---
Her
 attitude was that of a person who listens
---
A close criticism might have detected signs
 proving that she was intent on the latter alternative.

---
she was

---
By the aid of the Casterbridge aurora, and by feeling
 with her hands, the woman selected two sticks from the
 heaps.
---
These sticks were nearly straight to the height
 of three or four feet, where each branched into a fork
 like the letter Y. She sat down,.
---
She placed one of these forks under each
 arm as a crutch,.
---
The girl had made for herself a
 material aid.

---
The pat of her feet,
 and the tap of her sticks upon the highway, were all the
 sounds that came from the traveller now.
---
She had
 passed the last milestone by a good long distance, and

---
She was
 exhausted, and each swing forward became fainter.
---
At
 last she swayed sideways, and.

---
Here she lay, a shapeless heap, for ten minutes and
 more.
---
The woman desperately
 turned round upon her knees, and
---
Steadying herself by the help of one crutch, she
 essayed a step, then another, then a third,.
---
Thus she pro-
 gressed till descending Mellstock Hill
---
She staggered across to the first post,
 clung to it, and looked around.

---
She listened.
---
the woman murmured."
---
she added, after a pause.
---
After an interval she again spoke.
---
Holding to the rails, she advanced,.

---
whilst she dragged her feet on beneath
---
This woman was not given to soliloquy; but ex-

---
there I am!"
 I have. She said again in the
 same tone,"."

---
I'll believe, and
---
She passed five posts and.

---
" I'll pass five more by believing my longed- for spot
.
---
I can do it."

---
she passed five more.

---
She passed five more.

---
She passed them.

---
" she
 said,.

---
She crawled to the bridge.
---
During the effort each
 breath of the woman went into the air as if never to
 return again.

---
" she said,."
---
that I have less than half a mile
---
what she had known all the time

---
that she would have been powerless to face in
 the lump
---
that the woman, by
 some mysterious intuition, had grasped the paradoxical
 truth that blindness may operate more vigorously than
 prescience, and the short- sighted effect more than the
 far- seeing
---
The half- mile stood now before the sick and weary
 woman like a stolid Juggernaut.
---
It was an impassive
 King of her world.
---
She surveyed
 the wide space, the lights, herself,.

---
Every conceivable aid,
 method, stratagem, mechanism,, was revolved in her busy
 brain, and.
---
She thought of
 sticks, wheels,
---
crawling-- she even thought of rolling.

---
she whispered, and.

---
It glided noiselessly towards the recumbent woman.

---
She became conscious of something touching her
 hand
---
She
 opened her eye's, and
---
the substance touched her face.

---
A dog was licking her cheek.

---
even the suffering
 woman threw her idea into figure.

---
In her reclining position she looked up to him just
.
---
as in earlier times she had
---
who was as homeless as she
---
when the woman
 moved,
---
that she did not repulse him
---
A thought moved within her like lightning."
---
Perhaps
 I can make use of him
---
-- I  might do it then!"

---
She pointed in the direction of Casterbridge, and

---
she could not follow
---
The ultimate and saddest singularity of woman's effort
 and invention was reached.
---
when, with a quickened breath-
 ing, she rose to a stooping posture, and,
---
Whilst she
 sorrowed in her heart
---
she cheered with her voice, and

---
Her friend moved forward slowly, and
---
she with small
 mincing steps moved forward beside him,.
---
half her
 weight being thrown upon the animal
---
Sometimes
 she sank, from
 the crutches, from the rails.
---
as she had sunk from walking erect
---
who now
 thoroughly understood her desire and her incapacity
---
She always called
 him back, and
---
that the
 woman listened for human sounds
---
that she had an object in keeping her
 presence on the road and her forlorn state unknown
---
The woman raised herself
 as high as possible upon her knees, and.
---
She moved it and.

---
How did she get here?
---
" said one of the women.

---
FANNY IS SENT FOR



---
BATHSHEBA said very little to her husband all that
 evening of their return from market, and
---
Bathsheba going to church both morning and afternoon.

---
Her countenance instantly sank."
---
she said.

---
", I want it badly."
---
I
 do want it for races
---
Bathsheba replied, and
---
The tenderest and softest phases of Bathsheba's
 nature were prominent now--.
---
when she was cool

---
which the wariness of her character too frequently threw over them
---
Had the woman not been
 his wife
---
she asked.
---
she said, with features between a smile and a
 pout.

---
She reddened.
---
" I do that already.
---
" she said, quickly

---
" I wish.
---
I believe."

---
I do hate them."

---
She gave a sigh of resignation.
---
" I have about that
 sum here for household expenses.
---
I expect- morrow."

---
I shall have

---
" I must go, in spite of sentiment."
---
Bathsheba's eyes had been accidentally lifted at that
 moment, and
---
she saw the action and.
---
She
 flushed in pain and surprise, and
---
before she had thought
---
" she said.

---
It
 is the hair of a young woman I was going to marry
 before I knew you."

---
" Is she"
" No."
"

---
" Is she alive?
---
" Is she pretty?"

---
how she can be, poor thing, under
 such an awful affliction
---
" Why, her hair has been admired by everybody
 who has seen her since she has worn it loose, which has
 not been long.
---
" Bathsheba, do n't be so fitful and jealous.
---
: her
 heart was big in her throat, and
---
the ducts to her eyes
 were painfully full.
---
as she was
---
Ashamed to show
 emotion, at last she burst out:--

---
upon
 my heart, women will be the death of me
---
Trembling now, she put her hand upon his arm,
!
---
if you do n't love me better than any
 woman in the world
---
You like the woman
 who owns that pretty hair
---
You must like her
 best,!"

---
she said, in mournful astonishment.

---
when I am so wretchedly in earnest
---
I am not a fool,,
.

---
although I am a woman, and
---
she said,."
---
I do n't want much
---
once I felt.
---
I could be content
 with nothing less than the highest homage from the
 husband I should choose
---
the independent and
 spirited Bathsheba is come to this!"

---
, Bathsheba burst into great
 sobs-- dry- eyed sobs, which cut as they came, without
 any softening by tears.
---
But she determined to repress
 all evidences of feeling.
---
She was conquered; but
---
she
 would never own it as long as she lived.
---
Her pride
 was indeed brought low by despairing discoveries of her
 spoliation by marriage with a less pure nature than her
 own.
---
She chafed to and fro in rebelliousness, like a
 caged leopard
---
; her whole soul was in arms, and
---
the
 blood fired her face.
---
Until she had met Troy, Bath-

---
sheba had been proud of her position as a woman
---
; it
 had been a glory to her--
---
that her waist had

---
She hated
 herself now.
---
In those earlier days she had always
 nourished a secret contempt for girls who were the
 slaves of the first goodlooking young fellow who should
 choose to salute them.
---
She had never taken kindly to
 the idea of marriage in the abstract as did the majority
 of women she saw about her.
---
In the turmoil of her
 anxiety for her lover she had agreed; but

---
that had accompanied her happiest hours
 on this account
---
Although she scarcely knew
 the divinity's name
---
, Diana was the goddess whom
 Bathsheba instinctively adored.
---
That she had never
---
that she had felt herself sufficient to herself, and

---
if she had never
 stooped to folly of this kind
---
as she had stood on the hill at
 Norcombe, and
---
The next morning she rose earlier than usual, and

---
the horse saddled for her ride
---
When she came in at half- past
 eight-- their usual hour for breakfasting
---
-- she was in-

---
After breakfast she was cool and collected-- quite
 herself in fact-- and
---
she rambled to the gate,
---
which she still
 personally superintended as well as
---
her duties in the
 house would permit, continually, however,
---
Of course, she sometimes thought of him in the light of
 an old lover, and.
---
though she could feel
---
But
 Bathsheba,, was not much given
 to futile dreaming, and
---
her musings under this head
 were short and entirely confined to the times.

---
She saw.

---
Bathsheba blushed painfully,
 and.
---
Bathsheba, experienced great relief."
---
" she
 said.

---
that a conversation with a lady re-
 quired, spoke to Bathsheba over the gate
---
" You'll never see Fanny Robin no more-- use nor
 principal-- ma'am."

---
Because she's dead in the Union
---
"
" What did she die from?"

---
" I do n't know for certain; but
---
I should be.

---
She was such a limber maid that' a could stand no
 hardship, even when I knowed her, and' a went like a
 candle- snoff, so
---
She was took bad in the
 morning, and,
---
, she
 died in the evening.
---
She belongs by law to our parish;
 and
---
Fanny was my uncle's servant,
 and,
---
,
 FANNY IS SENT FOR
.
---
she belongs to me
---
the idea of Fanny being in a workhouse.
---
Bathsheba
 had begun, and
---
" Indeed I shall not let Mr. Boldwood do any such
 thing- i shall do it! although I only knew her for a couple of days she spoke
 with real feeling...."
---
not to put her in a waggon; we'll get a hearse."

---
" she said, musingly."
---
old
 Pleasant draw her
---
because she knew him so well."I, ma'am
---
I ought
."

---
when I gets to our churchyard gate
---
Casterbridge Union Fanny come
 to this
---
" Dear me---- and is?" said Bathsheba,.
---
she was far away
---
How long
 has she lived there?
---
" Oh!-- then she has not been staying there as a
 regular inmate?"

---
She first went, and
---
since then she's been picking up for several months,
 at the house of a very respectable widow- woman who
 takes in work of that sort.
---
She only got handy the
 Union- house on Sunday morning' a b'lieve, and' tis sup-
.
---
that she had traipsed every step
 of the way from Melchester
---
Why she left her place,

---
I ca n't say, for I do n't know; and as to a lie, why, I
 would n't tell it. No gem ever flashed from a rosy ray to a white one
 more rapidly than changed the young wife's counten-
 ance."
---
whilst this word came from her in a long- drawn
 breath
---
Did she walk along our turnpike- road?
---
" she
 said, in a suddenly restless and eager voice.

---
" I believe....
---
she did
---
Ma'am, shall I call Liddy?

---
" No; do n't call her; it is nothing.
---
When did she
 pass Weatherbury?"

---
What was the
 colour of Fanny Robin's hair?"

---
, I ca n't call to mind,!"

---
what I told you
---
She turned herself away from him,.
---
which had set its sign so visibly
 upon her
---
About an hour after, she
 heard the noise of the waggon and.
---
as she had directed

---
Bathsheba hardly saw them now.

---
" I do n't know, ma'am."

---
" I'm sure that all I know is that she arrived in the
 morning and died in the evening without further parley.

---
` Little Fanny Robin is dead, Joseph,'

---
I said,` Ah!-- did she
 come?'
---
` Well, she's dead in Casterhridge
 Union.
---
She reached the Union
 early Sunday morning, and.'
---
what she'd been doing
 lately
---
that she walked
 therefrom at the end of last week,
---
Her death might have been brought on by
 biding in the night wind, you know, ma'am;.
---
she'd go off in a decline
---
for people
 used to say: she used
---
She
 looked at him so intently that Joseph's eyes quailed.

---
she was looking upon the ground.

---
Bathsheba, still unhappy, went indoors again.
---
In
 the course of the afternoon she said to Liddy,,"?
---
What was the colour
 of poor Fanny Robin's hair
---
i only saw her for a day or two."

---
she wore it rather short,
 and.
---
But I have seen, and
---
her let it down
---
when
 she was going to bed
---
" One day I just named it to him, and.
---
" Liddy, for Heaven's sake stop your talking
---
said
 Bathsheba, with the nervous petulance that comes from
 worrying perceptions.





---
Their connection with her, short, was
 over for ever.

---
the dead
 silence was broken only by a heavy particle falling from
 a tree through the evergreens and alighting with a smart
 rap upon the coffin of poor Fanny.
---
And so she's nailed up in
 parish boards after all, and
---
you ca n't bring
 her to life, and
---
The poor woman
 is dead
---
, is n't she, and
---
there's the woman a- biding outside in the
 waggon.
---
followed by the maid of the inn bearing a candle
---
" Nobody can hurt a dead woman."
---
that
 could be done for her is done
---
All-- she's beyond us:  and

---
what you do with her at all
---
If she'd been
 alive
---
If she
 now wanted victuals and drink
---
But she's dead, and
---
no speed of ours will
 bring her to life.
---
The woman's past us-- time spent
 upon her is throwed away
---
Drink, shepherd, and be
 friends, for to- morrow we may be like her."

---
that was left of the unfortunate Fanny Robin who
 had followed the Eleventh from Casterbridge through
 Melchester and onwards
---
she had followed

---
that the whole truth of the matter might not be published
 till at any rate the girl had been in her grave for a few
 days, when the interposing barriers of earth and time,
 and a sense that the events had been somewhat shut
 into oblivion, would deaden the sting that revelation and
 invidious remark would have for Bathsheba just now
---
if she could
 tell me the reason of the delay
---
what were her
 wishes on the subject
---
as she looked up to him
---
her eyes were suspicious
 and
---
immediately afterwards, following Gabriel to the gate,
 she swerved to the extreme of solicitousness on Fanny's
 account, and.
---
that the girl might be brought into
 the house
---
just as she lay now, with her flowers
 and green leaves about her,
---
" she said,"."

---
though she may have erred
 grievously in leaving her home
---
that, she is still our sister:
 and
---
that God's uncovenanted
 mercies are extended towards her, and
---
that she is a
 member of the flock of Christ
---
Bathsheba seemed unmoved.
---
as Bathsheba directed
---
that might cast over Bathsheba's life a shade

---
" inquired Liddy,
 at a later hour the same evening,.

---
She was such a childlike, nesh young
 thing
---
that her spirit could n't appear to anybody
---
" Why do n't I?" said Bathsheba, desultorily.
---
She
 suddenly exclaimed in an impulsive and excited whisper,

---
anything strange said of Fanny
---
The words had no sooner escaped her, and
---
than an expres-
 sion of unutterable regret crossed her face
---
she
 burst into tears.

---
" No-- not a word!" said Liddy, looking at the
 weeping woman with astonishment.
---
She came
 to Bathsheba's side with a face full of sympathy.

---
Liddy then left the parlour and.

---
Bathsheba was lonely and miserable now;
---
lier actually than she had been before her marriage;
 but
---
her loneliness then was to that of the present time
.
---
Her
 wayward sentiment that evening concerning Fanny's
 temporary resting- place had been the result of a strange
 complication of impulses in Bathsheba's bosom.
---
Liddy reappeared, and
---
It
 is about Fanny.
---
that-- --" Liddy came close to
 her mistress and
---
as she spoke in
 the direction of the room where Fanny lay
---
Bathsheba trembled from head to foot.

---
she said, excitedly."
---
Bathsheba turned and.
---
that
 Liddy might not see her face
---
that her mistress
 was going
---
Finding to say no more, Liddy glided out
---
as she continued
---
Bathsheba's face, looking into the
 fire that evening, might have excited on

---
who loved her least
---
The sadness of Fanny Robin's fate did not make Bath-

---
although she was the Esther to this
 poor Vashti, and
---
When
 Liddy came into the room a second time the beautiful
 eyes which met hers had worn a listless, weary look-

---
When she went out after telling the story they had
---
Her simple
 country nature, fed on old- fashioned principles, was

---
which would have troubled a woman
 of the world very little, both Fanny and her child,
---
if she
 had one,
---
Bathsheba had grounds for conjecturing a connection
 between her own history and the dimly suspected
 tragedy of Fanny's end
---
The
 meeting with the lonely woman on the previous Saturday
 night had been unwitnessed and unspoken of.
---
that Bathsheba's
 perceptions had already been exercised in the matter
---
She suddenly felt a longing desire to speak to some
 one stronger than herself, and.
---
strength to sustain
 her surmised position with dignity and her lurking
 doubts with stoicism
---
Where could she find such a
 friend?
---
She was by far the
 coolest of the women under her roof.
---
she
 wanted
---
Might she but go to Gabriel Oak!--
---
, she thought, of enduring
 things.
---
she would wish
---
as
 she was at this moment
---
she felt convinced of that.

---
If she were?
---
She flung a cloak round her,.
---
Bathsheba closed
 the door, and.
---
till she came

---
From her standing- place in the road she could see him
 plainly,.
---
she knew, and
---
if she tapped
---
She felt
---
she could not do it,

---
Not for worlds now could she give a hint about her
 misery to him,.
---
She must suspect, and

---
she lingered by the bank
---
The contrast of the
 picture with her rebellious and agitated existence at this
 same time was too much for her to bear to look upon
 longer.
---
for her to make a truce with
 trouble by any such means
---
She must tread her giddy
.

---
as she had begun it
---
With a swollen heart she went again up the lane, and

---
More fevered now by a reaction from the first feelings
, she paused in
 the hall,.
---
wherein Fanny
 lay
---
She locked her fingers,.,.
---
O, I hope,
---
If I could

---
only look in upon you for one little minute, I should
 know all!"

---
she added, slowly,"
---
And
 I will"
 Bathsheba in
---
which carried her through the actions following this
 murmured resolution on this memorable evening of her
 life
---
She went to the lumber- closet for a screw- driver.

---
she found

---
whose conjectured end had so entirely engrossed her, and

---
as she gazed within
---
I know it now!
---
She was conscious of having brought about this
 situation by a series of actions done as by one in an
 extravagant dream; of following that idea as to method,

---
which had burst upon her in the hall with glaring
 obviousness, by gliding to the top of the stairs,, if she had antici-

---
within which the young girl lay, and

---
which came with knowing beyond doubt the
 last chapter of Fanny's story
---
Bathsheba's head sank upon her bosom, and the
 breath which had been bated in suspense, curiosity, and
 interest
---
" she said, and
---
the silent room added
 length to her moan.

---
Her tears fell fast beside the unconscious pair in the
 coffin: tears of a complicated origin, of a nature inde-
 scribable, almost indefinable except as other than those
 of simple sorrow.
---
Assuredly their wonted fires must
 have lived in Fanny's ashes.
---
The one feat alone-- that of dying--
, Fanny had achieved.
---
which had,
 in Bathsheba's wild imagining
---
lessness to ascendency; et had thrown over herself a
 garish light of mockery, and.

---
Fanny's face was framed in by that yellow hair of
 hers; and
---
she was retaliating for her pain with all the merciless
 rigour of the Mosaic law:".

---
Bathsheba indulged in contemplations of escape from
 her position by immediate death, which thought she,
 though it was an inconvenient and awful way,.

---
which had glorified it in her rival's case
---
She glided
 rapidly up and down the room,,

---
her hands hanging
---
as she thought and
---
O, I hate her, yet
---
I do n't mean; and
---
that I hate her, for

---
yet I hate her a little!

---
yes, my flesh insists upon hating her,!...
---
If she had only lived
---
, I could
 ave been angry and cruel towards her with some justifi-
 cation; but.
---
I am
 miserable at all this!"

---
Bathsheba became at this moment so terrified at her
 own state of mind that she looked around for some sort
 of refuge from herself.
---
would she.

---
She knelt beside the coffin,.

---
when Bathsheba arose
---
whether from a purely mechanical, or from any other
 cause, it was with a quieted spirit,
 and a regret for the antagonistic instincts which had
 seized upon her just before.

---
she took flowers
 from a vase by the window
---
Bathsheba knew no other
 way of showing kindness to persons departed than by
 giving them flowers.
---
She knew not.
---
how long she
 remained engaged thus
---
She forgot time, life, where
 she was,.
---
what she was doing
---
A slamming together of
 the coach- house doors in the yard brought her to her-
 self again.
---
" said Bathsheba, to herself
 more than to him.
---
She came with a dilated eye towards
 the door,.

---
she
 continued.

---
she went off into
 a state of passivity.
---
" Do you know her?"
---
said Bathsheba, in a small
 enclosed echo, as from the interior of a cell.

---
" I do.
---
" Is it she?"

---
Bathsheba was
---
perhaps in all Fanny's
 sufferings, much greater relatively to her strength, there
 never was a time she suffered in an absolute sense
 what Bathsheba suffered now.

---
At the sight and sound of that, to her, unendurable
 act, Bathsheba sprang towards him.
---
which had been scattered over her existence

---
since she knew
---
when she had
 meditated upon compromised honour, forestalment,
 eclipse in maternity by another
---
The revulsion from
 her indignant mood a little earlier,, was violent and entire.

---
She had sighed for
 her self- completeness then, and
---
now she cried aloud
 against the severance of the union she had deplored.

---
She flung her arms round Troy's neck,!
---
all women being alike at heart, even
 those so different in their accessories as Fanny and this
 one beside him
---
her to be his proud wife Bathsheba
---
Fanny's own
 spirit seemed.
---
, her rival being now but a corpse.
---
All the feeling
 she had been betrayed into showing she drew back to
 herself again by a strenuous effort of self- command.

---
" she asked
.

---
her bitter voice being strangely low-- quite that of
 another woman now
---
" I have."
---
that I have been a bad, black- hearted
 man
---
This woman is more
 to me, dead as she is, than ever you were, or are, or can
 be. 
---
At these words there arose from Bathsheba's lips a
 long, low cry of measureless despair and indignation,
 such a wail of anguish as had never before been heard
 within those old- inhabited walls.
---
If she's 
---
she added, as a
 continuation of the same cry, and.

---
She waited not an instant, but.





---
-- REACTION


 BATHSHEBA went along the dark road, neither know-
 ing nor caring about the direction or issue of her flight.

---
that she definitely noticed her position

---
when she reached a gate leading into a thicket
---
On looking
 into the place, it occurred to her.
---
that she had seen it
 by daylight on some previous occasion, and
---
She could think of
 nothing better to do with her palpitating self than to go
 in here and hide; and
---
entering, she lighted on a spot
 sheltered from the damp fog by a reclining trunk, where
 she sank down upon a tangled couch of fronds and
 stems.
---
She mechanically pulled some armfuls round
 her, and.

---
Whether she slept or not that night
---
Bathsheba was
 not clearly aware.
---
that, a long time afterwards, she
 became conscious of some interesting proceedings which
 were going on in the trees above her head and around
---
It was a robin.

---
she believed from his voice.
---
the ferns Bathsheba could just discern in the wan light
 of daybreak a team of her own horses
---
She
 watched.
---
She looked further around.
---
Day was just dawning,
 and beside its cool air and colours her heated actions
 and resolves of the night stood out in lurid contrast.

---
She perceived.
---
Bathsheba shook her dress to
 get rid of them, when multitudes of the same family lying
 round about her rose and fluttered away in the breeze
 thus created, like ghosts from an enchanter fleeing."

---
From her feet, and between the beautiful
 yellowing ferns with their feathery arms, the ground
 sloped downwards to a hollow,.
---
Bathsheba arose with a tremor at the
 thought of having passed the night on the brink of
 so dismal a place.

---
Bathsheba's nerves were still unstrung
---
:
 she crouched down out of sight again, and
---
Bathsheba was

---
The woman-- for it was a woman
 --.
---
When she got a little
 further round to the left, and
---
drew nearer, Bathsheba
 could see the newcomer's profile against the sunny
 sky', and.

---
Bathsheba's heart bounded with gratitude in and
---
that she was not altogether deserted
---
she
 jumped up."
---
she said, or
---
attempted to say;
 but the words had only been framed by her lips
---
She had lost her voice by exposure
 to the clogged atmosphere all these hours of night.

---
I am so glad I have found you."
---
said
 the girl, as soon as she saw Bathsheba.

---
Bathsheba said in a whisper,
.
---
she vainly endeavoured
---
Liddy, not knowing this, stepped
 down upon the swamp,,",
---
as she did so
---
saying, I think.
---
Bathsheba never forgot that transient little picture
 of Liddy crossing the swamp to her there in the
 morning light.
---
ranean breath rose from the sweating sod beside the
 waiting maid's feet as she trod,.

---
Liddy did not sink,.

---
as Bathsheba had anticipated
---
She landed safely on the other side, and.

---
Liddy, with tears in her eyes,
 Do hearten yourself up a little, ma'am
---
said Bathsheba,
---
" I suppose
.
---
I thought,,.
---
when I found
---
I fancy

---
I heard his voice late last night; and
---
just before I came out
---
" Is Fanny taken away?"

---
She will soon be-- at nine o'clock."

---
Liddy, without exactly understanding everything, or
 anything, in this episode, assented, and
---
" I shall not come indoors yet--
---
" Shall I get you something to eat, and something
 else to put over your head besides that little shawl?"

---
If you will, Liddy
---
Liddy vanished, and
---
Is Fanny gone
---
at the end of twenty minutes
 returned with a cloak, hat, some slices of bread and
 butter, a tea- cup, and some hot tea in a little china jug
"?" said Bathsheba.

---
" No." said her companion,.

---
Bathsheba wrapped herself up and.
---
Her voice was then a little clearer, and

---
trifling colour returned to her face."
---
" she said.

---
Bathsheba replying in monosyllables to Liddy's
 prattle,
---
She interrupted with--
" l wonder if Fanny is gone by this time?"

---
" I will go and."

---
She came back with the information that the
 men were just taking away the corpse
---
; that Bathsheba
 had been inquired for;.

---
that she had replied to the
 effect that her mistress was unwell and could not be
 seen
---
I am in my bedroom
---
Liddy then ventured
---
It is only women with
 no pride in them who run away from their husbands.

---
A runaway wife
 is an encumbrance to everybody, a burden to herself and
 a byword-- all of which make up a heap of misery
 greater than any that comes by staying at home--
.
---
Bathsheba
 glided up the back stairs to a disused attic, and
---
her
 companion followed.

---
she said, with a lighter heart, for youth and

---
I choose you.
---
Well, I shall take up my abode here for
 a while.
---
Afterwards, I want, and the be
 belonging to it, and a table, and some other things.

---
What shall I do?"

---
said
 Liddy.

---
I hate needlework
---
- i always did."

---
Liddy, I'll read.
---
I have n't heart."

---
A
 faint gleam of humour passed over her face
---
as she said:

---
All that day Bathsheba and Liddy lived in the attic
 in a state of barricade
---
Bathsheba sat
 at the window till sunset,,
 at other times watching every movement outside without
 much purpose, and listening without much interest to
 every sound.

---
She could see.
---
Bathsheba inquired, the next time that
 Liddy entered the room.

---
twas began putting up grand carved
 tombstone said Liddy. 
---
Bathsheba asked.

---
" I do n't."
---
said Liddy.





---
WHEN Troy's wife had left the house at the previous
 midnight
---
Twenty pounds having been secured from Bathsheba
---
no
 Fanny appeared.
---
at that moment she was being

---
In fact, robed in her grave- clothes by two attendants at the
 Union poorhouse-- the first and last tiring- women the
 gentle creature had ever been honoured with.
---
backed up by Bathsheba's reproaches
---
that Fanny
 had been really prevented by illness from keeping her
 promise
---
This time she could have made no mistake

---
I want a good tomb.
---
The
 crocuses and hyacinths were; some of
 the summer flowers he placed over her head and feet,
 the lilies and forget- me- nots over her heart.
---
so
 carefully planted by Fanny's repentant lover
---
The planting
 of flowers on Fanny's grave had been perhaps but a
 species of elusion of the primary grief, and
---
Meanwhile, Bathsheba remained a voluntary prisoner
 in the attic.
---
The door was kept except during
 the entries and exits of Liddy,
---
she called Bathsheba's attention to it.

---
until Liddy was sent to bed
---
bathsheba did not sleep very heavily that night.

---
When her attendant was unconscious and softly breath-

---
Bathsheba sat
 here, and
---
when
 she withdrew and
---
she arose again, and.
---
she could hear another noise
 -- peculiar, and not intermittent like the rest, the purl
 of water falling into a pool
---
Liddy knocked at eight o'clock, and Bathsheba un-
.

---
" said Liddy,.

---
when her inquiries about breakfast had been
 made
---
" I heard one strange noise.
---
I've been thinking."

---
which I thought
---
, Bathsheba asked
 Liddy.
---
The tongue of the
 more childish woman still ran upon recent events.
---
"" she asked.

---
" Not that I know of.
---
" said Bathsheba.

---
" I thought.
---
where they
 have put Fanny
---
Bathsheba had all sorts of dreads about meeting her
 husband."
---
" she said
".

---
No, ma'am; I think
---
She hated, and but
---
Bathsheba had

---
"" she said.

---
Bathsheba was momentarily relieved of that wayward
 heaviness of the past twenty- four hours which had

---
So, she put on her bonnet, and.
---
, she was not likely to meet many of them in
 the road.
---
that Fanny had been laid in
---
She had been unable to
.

---
that some connection existed
 between her rival and the light through the trees
---
Bathsheba skirted the buttress, and.
---
her arrival
 having been noiseless
---
, she had not as yet attracted his
 attention.
---
Bathsheba did not at once perceive, and

---
that the
 grand tomb and the disturbed grave were Fanny's
---
she looked on both sides and around for some humbler
 mound,.
---
she read the words with
 which the inscription opened: --
" Erected by Francis Troy in Beloved Memory of
 Fanny Robin."

---
how she received this knowledge of the
 authorship of the work, which to himself had caused
 considerable astonishment
---
she bade him good morning, and.
---
as she desired
---
, Bathsheba collected the
 flowers, and.
---
which is so conspicuous
 in a woman's gardening, and
---
She requested Oak to
.

---
whose narrower instincts have brought down bitterness
 upon her instead of love
---
Finally, with the superfluous magnanimity of a woman
, she wiped the mud spots from
 the tomb,

as if she rather liked its words than otherwise

DOUBTS LINGER


 BATHSHEBA underwent the enlargement of her
 Husband's absence from hours to days with a slight
 feeling of surprise, and a slight feeling of relief; yet

---
She belonged to
 him: 
---
that she could not speculate on contingencies
---
Taking
 no further interest in herself as a splendid woman, she
 acquired the indifferent feelings of an outsider in contem-

---
Her original vigorous
 pride of youth had sickened, and
---
with it had declined
 all her anxieties about coming years,.
---
Bath-
 sheba had made up her mind
---
that alternatives on any
 noteworthy scale had ceased for her
---
ally been shown by the agent to the estate some distrust
 of Bathsheba's tenure as James Everdene's successor,
 on the score of her sex, and her youth, and her beauty;

---
which came suddenly into
 her hands
---
She had latterly been in great doubt as
 to what the legal effects of her marriage would be upon
 her position; but
---
no notice had been taken as yet of
 her change of name, and.
---
Hence Bathsheba lived in a perception that her
 purposes were broken of.
---
She was not a woman who
 could hope on without good materials for the process,

---
that her mistake had been a fatal one
---
differing thus from the less far- Sighted and energetic,
 though more petted ones of the sex, with whom hope
 goes on as a sort of clockwork; and perceiving
 clearly, she
 accepted her position, and.

---
The first Saturday after Troy's departure she went
 to Casterbridge alone, a journey she had not before
 taken since her marriage.
---
gazed upon by the burghers
 with feelings that those healthy lives were dearly paid
 for by exclusion from possible aldermanship, when a
 man, who had apparently been following her, said some
 words to another on her left hand
---
Bathsheba's ears
 were keen as those of any wild animal, and she dis-

---
Is that she there?"

---
As if endowed with the spirit of prophecy, Bathsheba
 gasped out,"!"

---
Then she said and.
---
The ice of self-
 command latterly gathered over her was
 broken, and the currents burst forth again, and over
 whelmed her.
---
A darkness came into her eyes, and
---
she
 fell.

---
who had
 been observing her from under the portico of the old
 corn- exchange
---
when she passed through the group
 without
---
as she sank

---
by the time-- so
 lothly-- the precious burden upon a sofa, Bathsheba had
 opened her eyes.
---
she murmured
---
For
 those few heavenly, golden moments she had been in his
 arms.
---
What did it matter about her not knowing it?
---
She
 had been close to his breast
---
sending a woman to
 her, went out.

---
as she
 had driven to town, Boldwood
---
which was more com-
 fortable than her own conveyance
---
These proposals
 Bathsheba gently declined, and
---
About half- an- hour later she invigorated herself by
 an effort, and.

---
She went out of the town by a tortuous back street, and
.
---
when Bathsheba reached home, where, silently
 alighting and leaving the horse in the hands of the boy
---
she proceeded at once upstairs.
---
Liddy met her on the
 landing.
---
The news had preceded Bathsheba to Weather-
 bury by half- an- hour, and
---
Liddy looked inquiringly into
 her mistress's face.
---
Bathsheba had nothing to say.

---
She entered her bedroom and
---
the
 extreme lines only of her shape were visible.
---
she said.

---
I was thinking."
---
" said Liddy, with hesitation.

---
" No, no, no." said Bathsheba, hurriedly.

---
" But I suppose
---
, I think.
---
said Liddy, amazed.

---
" I do n't know it.
---
should n't I have heard more, or?
---
-- or- i do n't know, but

---
I am
 perfectly convinced that he is still alive!"

---
Bathsheba remained firm in this opinion till Monday,
.
---
for her to examine and
---
It
 was so evident to her in the midst of her agitation.

---
Then Bathsheba said to herself strange that she should not
 be.
---
A strange reflection occurred to her,.
---
how the apparent might
 differ from the real- made vivid by her bygone jealousy
 of Fanny,
---
When alone late that evening beside a small fire, and
 much calmed down, Bathsheba took Troy's watch into
 her hand, which had been restored to her with the rest
 of the articles belonging to him.
---
She opened the case
.
---
she was his
---
" she said.
---
" I am nothing to either of them,
 and
---
why should I keep her hair?
---
" She took it in her
 hand, and."
---
she added,
.





---
Bathsheba, having
 previously been living in a state of suspended feeling
 which was not suspense, now lived in a mood of
 quietude which was not precisely peacefulness.
---
While
 she had known him
---
to be alive she could have thought
 of his death with equanimity; but
---
now she had lost him
---
, she regretted.
---
She kept the farm.
---
because she had done so in bygone
 days,
---
She looked back upon that
 past over a great gulf,,

---
as if she were now a dead person
---
, she could sit and.

---
Whether it was sug-
 gested by Bathsheba's recent act of promotion or not
---
when she learnt of this proposal- for
 Oak
---
Bathsheba, was obliged
---
She considered.

---
whose unreasoning devotion to Bathsheba could only
 be characterized as a fond madness which neither
 time nor circumstance, evil nor good report, could
 weaken or destroy
---
Bathsheba
 having at last been persuaded.
---
as she entered the church in that guise

---
to
 recognize was that the severe schooling she had been
 subjected to had made Bathsheba much more con-
 siderate than she had formerly been of the feelings of
 others, and
---
that, should she be willing at
 any time in the future to marry any man at all
---
There was a substratum of
 good feeling in her:.
---
she had thoughtlessly done him
---
her self- reproach for the injury
 might be depended
 upon now to a much greater extent than before her
 infatuation and disappointment
---
To the eyes of the middle- aged, Bathsheba was
 perhaps additionally charming just now.
---
Her exuber-
 ance of spirit was pruned down
---
; the original phantom
 of delight had shown herself, and
---
she had been able to
 enter this second poetical phase without losing much
 of the first in the process.

---
Bathsheba's return from a two months' visit to her
 old aunt at Norcombe afforded the impassioned and
 yearning farmer a pretext for inquiring directly after
 her-- now possibly in the ninth month of her
 widowhood-- and endeavouring to get a notion of her
 middle of the haymaking, and
---
She simpered, and
---
after her long
 the coldest- hearted neighbour could scarcely say less

---
When I see people strut
 enough to he cut up into bantam cocks, I stand
 dormant with wonder, and!"
" I am glad to see you out of doors, Lydia."" She is quite well, sir
---
she was cheerful
---
I merely said."
" She do, sir.
---
if she were
---
I've been with her all through her
 troubles, and. I should bide with her" She promises."
---
" No-- she does n't promise it exactly.
---
When she alludes to the
 possibility of marrying again
---
" Yes, yes, I understand., you conclude-- --"
" She never do allude to it, sir."
---
said Liddy,.

---
Well,
 perhaps, as she is absolute mistress again now, it is wise
 of her."

---
" My mistress did certainly once say, though not
 seriously, risk Mr. Troy's coming back and claiming her."

---
that she supposed,
---
she might marry again at
 the end of seven years from last year
---
if she cared to

---
that she
 might
---
She might marry at once in every reasonable
 person's opinion,."

---
to ask them said Liddy, innocently.

---
In little
 more than six years from this time Bathsheba might
 certainly marry him.
---
There was something definite in
 that hope, for admitting that there might have been no
 deep thought in her words to Liddy about marriage
---
,
 they showed at least her creed on the matter.

---
she had never yet known its full volume,
---
her see,
---
But the large united
 flocks of Bathsheba and Farmer Boldwood formed a
 valuable and imposing multitude which demanded much
 attention, and
---
Bathsheba's and Farmer Boldwood's
 mainly belonged.
---
" How can I help?"" O that helpless feymels should be at the mercy of
 she swayed like a reed shaken by the wind.

---
" Did ye ever hear such onreasonable
 woman as that?
---
Upon my carcase, neighbours,, the damn women
 might eat the show for me!"

---
that
 the woman in spangles, brazen rings set with glass
 diamonds, and with chalked face and shoulders,, hastily dropped it again from
 a fear that some trick had been played to burn her
 fingers
---
Whether Bathsheba
 thought him dead
---
Bathsheba was not a women to be made
 a fool of, or a woman to suffer in silence; and
---
that his
 wife would fail at her farming,
---
if she had not already
 done so
---
such a future of poverty
 with her would be,
---
Bathsheba---- had, like every one else,
 read or, and
---
she was not yet too old
 and careworn to be without a little curiosity to see him.

---
The crowd
 had passed in, and Boldwood, who had been watching
 all the day for an opportunity of speaking to her, seeing
 her comparatively isolated
---
said Bathsheba, colour springing
 up in the centre of her cheeks.
---
I was fortunate
 enough to sell them all just as we got upon the hill, so

---
" Yes, except that I have: 
---
otherwise I should be going home.

---
Indeed, I think
."

---
I've heard
---
I hope."

---
, I suppose?
---
I was not allowed.
---
when I was young
---
", I suppose.
---
Am I right

---
, I'll get a seat for you with
 pleasure."
---
that she hesitated
---
I
 myself shall not stay
---
Perceiving to see it: I've seen it before."

---
Now Bathsheba did care a little, and

---
because she
 feared
---
She had been hoping but
---
that she said,"
---
, I think

---
I will go in for a minute or two
---
And so a short time after this Bathsheba appeared
 in the tent with Boldwood at her elbow, who, taking
 her to a" reserved" seat, again withdrew.

---
that she was the
 single reserved individual in the tent
---
Bathsheba
 immediately found, to her confusion,, the rest of the
 crowded spectators, one and all, standing on their legs
 on the borders of the arena, where they got twice as
 good a view of the performance for half the money.

---
as many eyes were turned upon her
---
Once there, Bathsheba was
 forced and.
---
she sat
 down,
---
In a few
 minutes she noticed the fat red nape of Coggan's neck
 among those standing just below her, and Joseph Poor-
 grass's saintly profile a little further on.

---
that she would be sure to recognize
 his voice
---
But here was Bathsheba in her own person; and
---
She looked so charming and fair that his cool mood
 about Weatherbury people was changed.
---
her to exercise this power over him in the
 twinkling of an eye
---
as she lay
 upon the board upon his shoulder
---
if she never had done so before
---
; she
 was conversing with a man.
---
if, then, she reckoned upon his
 death as an absolute certainty
---
She was
 leaning back,
---
that she held in her
 hand
---
who had apparently just brought the cup to her,
 Bathsheba,
---
that it was pressed to the shape of
 her shoulder
---
she was, in fact, as good as in Troy's
 arms
---
that she might not feel its warmth through the
 cloth
---
She was handsome as ever, and
---
she was his.
---
It
 was some minutes wish to go in, and claim her.
---
the proud girl even whilst it was
---
," said Bathsheba."
---
But I must be going
 at once.
---
I should have gone two hours
 ago,.
---
I had no idea of
 coming in here; but
---
though I should never have got one
---
She took
 out her purse and.
---
" she said, coldly.
---
That
 Bathsheba could not endure
---
" I'll write it down."
---
Bathsheba would not read it
---
; she would not even put
 out her hand.
---
" Oh, well." said Bathsheba, carelessly,; but
---
I can guess.

---
Bathsheba held the note in her right hand.
---
wood handed towards her a plate of cut bread- and-
 butter;.
---
when, in order to take a slice, she put the note
 into her left hand, where she was still holding the purse,
 and
---
her hand to drop beside her close to
 the canvas
---
encircled by a bracelet of coral chippings which
 she wore
---
which burst from
 her
---
that Bathsheba, without telling Oak or
 anybody, resolved
---
as she had

---
But having fallen in with Farmer Boldwood
 accidentally( on her part at least) at the refreshment-
 tent, she found it impossible to refuse his offer to ride
 on horseback beside her as escort.
---
before she was aware
---
Immediately after the incident in the tent, she had

---
whose company she would have
---
; she would not,
---
ever, could not be helped on any
 consideration, treat Boldwood harshly, having once
 already illused him, and, she drove across the hilltop in
 the wending way's which led downwards-- to oblivious
 obscurity,.
---
The keen instincts of Bathsheba had perceived, and
---
that
 the farmer's staunch devotion to herself was still un-
 diminished
---
she sympathized deeply.
---
The sight
 had quite depressed her this evening;
---
had reminded
 her of her folly; she wished anew,, for some means of making repara-
 tion for her fault.
---
as she had wished
 many months ago
---
This point- blank query unmistakably confused her,

---
that
 she said,"
---
I have not seriously thought of any such
 subject
---
" I quite understand that.
---
so that I may
 not be really a widow
---
" she said, escape that the fact afforded
" Not absolutely proved, perhaps, but it was proved
 circumstantially.
---
have you, ma'am, I should imagine.

---
O yes I have, or
---
I should have acted differently,"

---
" she said, gently.
---
From the first, I have had a strange
 uaccountable feeling that he could not have perished,
 but
---
I have been able to explain that in several ways
 since.
---
Even were I half persuaded
---
that I shall see
 him no more
---
, I am far from thinking of marriage with
 another.
---
I should be very contemptible to indulge in
 such a thought.
---
when I carried my arms into the King's Arms, in Casterbridge
---
I know
---
"- I know it all.
---
" she said, hurriedly.

---
" I, for one, shall never cease."

---
" I, too, am very sorry."
---
she said, and.
---
I mean
---
",, I am sorry you thought

---
"
" I have always this dreary pleasure in thinking over
 those past times with you--
---
that I was something to
 you.
---
" I did; and?"

---
I do n't know
---
"-- at least, I can not tell you.
---
for a woman to define her feelings in language
 which is chiefly made by men to express theirs
---
I shall eternally regret it.
---
I so
 longed.
---
Bathsheba, suppose?"

---
" I can not say.
---
" she said, quickly.
---
" I know all that.
---
" Yes, yes; I have found that in my own experience."

---
If I
 wait that time
---
I mean,
---
that I do n't like.
---
I ought.
---
seeing that, to make a bargain with me for a far- ahead
 time-- an agreement make me happy,-- there is
 no fault to be found with you as a woman.
---
She
 said, with some distress in her voice,
---
for she remembered
 vividly his outburst on the Yalbury Road, and shrank
 from a repetition of his anger:
---
--
" I will never marry another man?
---
it stand in these simple words-- that in six
 years' time you will be my wife
---
I know.
---
I hesitate
---
She breathed; and
---
O what
 shall I do
---
I do n't love you, and
---
I much fear.
---
that I
 never shall love you as much as a woman ought to love
 a husband
---
I can yet give
 you happiness by a mere promise to marry at the end of
 six years,
---
if you value such an act of
 friendship from a woman who does n't esteem her-
 self as she did, and
---
if I can not promise soon
---
I mean soon.
---
Bathsheba was in a very peculiar state of mind,
.
---
that she felt own will, not only into the act of promising upon this
 singularly remote and vague matter, but into the emo-
 tion of fancying that she ought to promise
---
coerced by a force stronger than her

---
,
 her anxiety and perplexity increased.

---
One day she was led by an accident into an oddly
 confidential dialogue with Gabriel about her difficulty

---
It afforded her a little relief-- of a dull and cheerless
 kind.
---
Then out came her trouble;
 and
---
before she was aware
---
she told him;

---
how she had again got into the toils
---
she said sadly," and
---
I think
---
yet- i believe."

---
if I do n't give my word
---
she continued, with reckless frank-
 ness;" and
---
that a watched woman must have very
 much circumspection to retain only a very little credit,
 and
---
" she
 said shortly."
---
" That I'm willing to pay the penalty of.
---
I
 hate the act of marriage under such circumstances, and
 the class of women I should seem to belong to by doing
 it!"
" It seems to me."

---
She did not reply at once, and."
---
She had spoken frankly, and.
---
that she had obtained
---
she would
 not allow
---
herself to recognize
---
Not that she would have

---
she saying all the time that such thoughts of the future
 were improper, and?
---
then she
 would have shown how kind and inoffensive.
---
she had asked for
---
Bathsheba was at this time in her room,.
---
She had called for candles, and
---
Liddy
 entered and.

---
said Bathsheba, almost
 timidly.
---
I am foolishly agitated
---
"- i can not tell why.

---
I wish; but

---
I had not been obliged
---
I have not spoken to Mr.
 Boldwood since the autumn,, but
---
I promised
---
I had no idea there

---
" But I would go now."
---
said Liddy, who was going
 with her
---
" Yes, I shall make my appearance, of course."
---
said
 Bathsheba."
---
But I am THE CAUSE of the party, and
---
" Yes. I am the reason of the party- i.
---
I
 ca n't explain any more
---
I wish."

---
I had never seen Weatherbury
---
I have never been free from trouble
, and
---
since I have lived here
---
No; I will appear as usual,.
---
if
 I were
---
I should seem solemn all the time
---
when I am

---
" Does a woman keep her promise, Gabriel?"

---
If it is not inconvenient to her
---
she may
---
However, does
 a woman keep a promise, not to marry, but to enter on
 an engagement to marry at some time?
---
Now you
 know women better than I
---
However, she may keep such a promise,."

---
she inclines
, and
---
She has a notion that a woman
 should not marry within seven years of her husband's
 disappearance-- that her own self should n't, I mean--
 because his body was not found.
---
It may be merely
 this legal reason which influences her, or
---
she is reluctant to talk on the point-

---
Yet she has promised--."

---
that she will ratify an
 engagement to- night
---
Her meaning may be good; but

---
there-- she's young yet."

---
" She never promised me at that first time, and
---
hence
 she did not break her promise!
---
If she promises me
---
,
 she'll marry me
---
, Bathsheba is a woman to her word."
                      
---
there's really
 anything going on between her and Boldwood
---
How she.
 must detest me!
---
whether she
 has encouraged him
---
that she was gwine
 to the party at his house to- night
---
This is the first
 time she has ever gone there
---
ever, she's not fond of him-- quite offish and quite care
 less
---
She's a handsome
 woman, Pennyways,
---
is she not?
---
How did she look
---
" Oh, she took no great heed of me, ye may well
 fancy; but
---
she looked well enough,.
---
She had just got
 off her mare
---
to look at the last wring- down of cider for
 the year; she had been riding, and.
---
so her colours were
 up and her breath rather quick,- every time plain
 to my eye
---
so that her bosom
 plimmed and feli- plimmed and feli
---
Never mind me," says she.
---
Then Gabe
 brought her some of the new cider, and she must
 needs go drinking it through a strawmote, and not in
 a nateral way at all."
---
," says she,
---
Liddy" bring indoors
 a few gallons, and
---
Sergeant,
 I was no more to her than a morsel of scroffin the fuel
 house!"

---
She ca n't do without
 him, and.

---
" Ah baily she's a notch above you, and
---
said Bathsheba,
.

---
" I never saw.
---
that I am setting myself to

---
, I suppose.
---
" she murmured.

---
I dread
---
yet I dread the
 risk of wounding him by staying away."Anyhow, ma'am.'
---
" I do n't know
---
, I feel wretched at
 one time, and buoyant at another.
---
I wish.

---
I could have

---
as I have been for the last year
 or so
---
" Liddy-- none of that." said Bathsheba, gravely.

---
" Mind, I wo n't hear.
---
" I beg pardon, ma'am.
---
before you go I want to
 mention what has been passing in my mind lately--
 I mean how little I attend to business now, Well, since the world
 is brightening for me, I want. I'll
 make a memorandum of the arrangement which struck
 me as likely to be convenient, for I have n't time to talk
 about it now; and until you can take all the expendi-
 ture upon your shoulders, I'll be a sleeping partner in
 the stock. Then, if I marry her-- and I hope- i feel I
" Pray do n't speak of it, sir."
---
: your
 interest in her is more than that of bailiff for an em-
 ployer.
---
It contained a woman's finger- ring, all the way round with small diamonds, and from its
 appearance
---
A good wife is
 good, but
---
the best wife is not so good as no wife at all.

---
" There she is
 with plenty of money, and a house and farm, and
 horses, and comfort, and
---
that his wife
 would be in such a hurry to get rid of his name
---
I am glad of it; I've been
 seen and. I should
 have gone back to her the day after the fair,; and I do n't put it off any longer.
 What the deuce put it into my head to run away at all,
 I ca n't think!" I should have known it. She's bad enough for
 anything."

---
for should Bathsheba and Troy become recon-

---
she likes you yet
---
that she knows nothing about it
---
that she shall
---
" What a fool she must have been ever!
---
She is too,."

---
that one is more minded to say it
 serves her right than pity her
---
She was no
 otherwise than a girl mind, and
---
how could she tell?
---
than she ought to hae
---
And I'm in-
.' twill flurry her, and; and,'
---
twill do no good to forestall
 her time o' trouble
---
though Henery Fray and some of'em do speak against
 her
---
, she's never been anything but fair to me.
---
She's
 hot and hasty, but
---
she's a brave girl who'll never tell a
 lie however much the truth may harm her, and I've no
 cause to wish her evil."

---
" She never do tell women's little lies,.
---
she thinks
---
she says to yer
---
she'll come, or
---
as she met
 him
---
The spree is all in her honour
---
she not care a bit about en."

---
The
 air was big with Bathsheba's fortunes to- night: 
---
every
 word everywhere concerned her.
---
" We know very well that master's on a
 wrong tack, and that she's quite in the dark, and we
 should let'em know at once.
---
Laban, you know her
 best
---
haps she wo n't come and."

---
Bathsheba had been perplexed
,
---
for she was not much more than
---
the weight of stateliness sat
 heavy upon her.
---
Sometimes she thought
---
she ought

---
not to have come under any circumstances; then she
 considered and.

---
that she could

---
Her allotted hour having been passed in chatting
 and
---
, Bathsheba told Liddy.

---
she had hardly
 been there a moment when the master of the house
 entered.

---
Her
 manner was restive,."
---
for she remembered her promise,
 and
---
" she added,"."

---
" Bathsheba silently looked on the floor.

---
" she whispered.

---
that it was the only tone in which
 she would allow him to approach her
---
said Bathsheba;" that is, if you
 demand it.
---
But I am a changed woman-- an unhappy
 woman-- and not-- not-- --
---
"
" You are still a very beautiful woman
---
the remark,
 been adopted by blunt flattery to soothe and win her
---
for for she said,
 in a passionless murmur which was in itself a proof of
 her words:" I have no feeling in the matter at all
---
And I do n't at all know, and
---
I have.
---
But
 I give my promise,.
---
if I must
---
I give it as the rendering of
 a debt, conditionally, of course, on my being a widow."

---
I'll marry nobody
 else.
---
O, I do n't know

" she said,."
---
her
 bosom beginning
---
I am afraid what to do!

---
if I
 ought or no

; I
 deserve it,!
---
indeed I do,
---
for I have loved you more than
 anybody in the world
---
The trimmings of her dress,, showed, and
---
how agitated she was
---
when she had power to frame the words
---
if I said hasty words and
, I did not mean to distress you; I was in
 agony, Bathsheba, and I did not know what I said.
 what I have suffered Sometimes I shrink from your
 what I have felt for you, and sometimes I am
 distressed that all of it you never will know. when I would give
 up my life for you if I say in five or six years" Yes, then I'll leave it to time."
 If he does not return, I'll marry you
 in six years from this day,." she said
 solemnly.

Oh I can not wear a ring!

In her trouble at not being able to get her hand away
 from him at once, she stamped passionately on the floor
 with one foot, and
---
tears crowded to her eyes again.

she said,."
---
as if her heart
 would break
---
Bathsheba sat down in a chair, and.
---
At length she said, in a sort of hopeless whisper--
" Very well, then, I will to- night,.
---
I will

Now loosen my hand;, indeed I will
 wear it to- night."

she said, non- resistance.

 best could, followed the girl, and
---
before doing so she paused on the bottom of
 the staircase which descended into one corner,.

---
" to tell her, you had better do it now."

---
the farmer asked
 Bathsheba, across the room.

---
" I do n't in the least," said Bathsheba.

---
" said Bathsheba
---
Though I did n't
 tell them."

---
she said.

---
Nobody noted
 Bathsheba.
---
She was leaning on the stairs.
---
Her brow
 had heavily contracted
---
; her whole face was pallid, her
 lips apart,.

---
her eyes rigidly staring at their visitor
---
The poor girl's wretched-
 ness at this time was beyond all fancy or narration.

---
She had sunk down on the lowest stair; and
---
there
 she sat, her mouth blue and dry, and her dark eyes
 fixed vacantly upon him, as if she wondered whether it
 were not all a terrible illusion.

---
She made no reply.

---
Bathsheba moved her feet a little, but.

---
" Bathsheba, go with your husband!"

---
Nevertheless, she did not move.
---
that Bathsheba was beyond the pale of activity-- and
 yet not in a swoon
---
She was in a state of mental GUTTA
 SERENA
---
; her mind was for the minute totally deprived of
 light at the same time.

---
when she quickly shrank back
---
at the moment of his seizure she writhed, and.

---
When Bathsheba had cried out in her husband's
 grasp,
---
As for
 Bathsheba, she had changed.
---
She was sitting on the
 floor beside the body of Troy,
---
where she had
---
herself lifted it.
---
With one hand she
 held her handkerchief to his breast and
---
with the other she tightly clasped one of
 his.
---
The household convulsion had made her herself
 again.
---
Bathsheba was astonishing all around her
 now,
---
she
 seldom thought practicable.

---
what she did not practise
---
She was of the stuff of which great men's mothers
 are made.
---
She was indispensable to high generation,
.

---
" she said, automatically,."
---
I believe,
---
Her statement of the fact in such quiet and simple
 words came with more force than a tragic declamation,
 and.
---
She's had
---
She had no
 right to do that.
---
she should have waited."

---
" Yes, sir; it was hinted to her
---
that she had better

---
But she said, and
---
law was
 nothing to her
---
she would n't let."

---
Mr. Aldritch drove at once back again up the
 hill to Bathsheba's.
---
The first person was
 poor Liddy, who seemed literally to have dwindled
 smaller in these few latter hours.
---
said Liddy, with suspended
 breath.
---
" Where is she?"

---
taken upstairs, she said.
---
she wanted no
 further help from the men
---
And then she called me,
 and and
---
I
 had better go and
---
because I looked so ill
---
Then she locked herself into the room alone with him,
 and.

---
But I thought
---
I'd wait in the next room in case
---
she
 should want me.
---
I heard, but
---
her moving about inside
 for more than an  hour
---
she only came out once,
 and.
---
She said."

---
her
 know
---
Liddy knocked, and

---
Bathsheba's dress was heard:

---
she opened the door.

---
Her looks were calm and nearly rigid, like a slightly
 animated bust of Melpomene.

---
" she
 murmured from her lips merely, and."
---
" She, crossed the landing, and.

---
she had vacated

---
as she says
---
She must have the
 nerve of a stoic!"

---
that her fortitude had been more of

---
Then, will than of spontaneity, she silently sank down between
 them and.

---
They took her away into a further room, and
---
the
 medical attendance was invaluable in Bathsheba's, who fell into a
 series of fainting- fits that had a serious aspect for a
 time.
---
Liddy
 kept watch in Bathsheba's chamber, where she heard
 her mistress, moaning in whispers through the dull
 slow hours of that wretched night:
---
how can I live!
---
O Heaven, how can I live!"




 CHAPTER LV




---
" Joseph, I seed,"

---
There were several sets of ladies"
 dresses in the piece, of sundry expensive materials;
 silks and satins, poplins and velvets, all of colours
 which from Bathsheba's style of dress might have been
 judged to be her favourites.
---
" Is she downstairs?"

---
as she was too
---
She's but very little better now again.
---
than she was at
 Christmas
---
She keeps on, and

---
till one's wearied out wi' answering her.

---
said Liddy.

---
", she'll go out of her mind too.
---
Poor thing;
 her sufferings have been dreadful
---
; she deserves any-
 body's pity."

---
What I've arranged" I do so hope."" Is she altered much?
---
",
 you would n't know her."
---
said Liddy.
---
" Her eyes are so
 miserable that she's not the same woman.
---
Only two
 years ago she was a romping girl, and
---
now she's this!"

---
AFTER ALL


 BATHSHEBA revived with the spring
---
that had followed the low fever from which
 she had suffered diminished perceptibly
---
But she remained alone now for the greater part of
 her time, and.
---
She shunned every one, even Liddy,
 and
---
she passed more of her time
 in the open air, and.

---
though she never rode
 out or
---
One Friday evening in August she walked a little way
 along the road and.

---
None of the old colour had as yet come to her cheek,
 and
---
its absolute paleness was heightened by the jet black
 of her gown,.
---
When she
 reached a little shop at the other end of the place,
 which stood nearly opposite to the churchyard, Bath-
 sheba heard singing inside the church, and she knew
 that the singers were practising.
---
She crossed the road,
.
---
Her stealthy
 walk was to the nook wherein Troy had worked at
 planting flowers upon Fanny Robin's grave, and
---
she
 came to the marble tombstone.

---
A motion of satisfaction enlivened her face.
---
as she
 read the complete inscription
---
Whilst she stood and
---
she went
 with the same light step round to the porch and.

---
Bathsheba was stirred by emotions which
 latterly she had assumed to be altogether dead within
 her.
---
The little attenuated voices of the children
 brought to her ear in destinct utterance the words they
 sang without thought or comprehension--
 Lead, kindly Light, amid the encircling gloom,

---
Bathsheba's feeling was always to some extent de-

---
pendent upon her whim, as is the case with many other
 women.
---
Something big came into her throat and an
 uprising to her eyes-- and
---
she thought.
---
that she would
 allow
---
one fell upon the stone
 bench beside her.
---
Once that she had begun
---
to cry for
 she hardly knew.
---
what, she could not leave off for crowd-
 ing thoughts she knew too well
---
She would have given
 anything in the world to be, as those children were, un-
 concerned at the meaning of their words, because too
 innocent to feel the necessity for any such expression.

---
All the impassioned scenes of her brief expenence
 seemed,
 and
---
Yet grief came
 to her rather as a luxury than as the scourge of former
 times.

---
Owing to Bathsheba's face being buried in her hands
 she did not notice a form which came quietly into the
 porch, and
---
Bathsheba did not raise
 her head for some time, and
---
when she looked round

---
her face was wet, and."
---
her eyes drowned and dim
---
" said Bathsheba; and
---
" I was.
---
Then they stood in a state of some embarrassment
 dreadfully drenched and
 inflamed face without his noticing her.
---
Bathsheba trying
---
" No." she said.
---
I came
---
as I
 wished Mr. Oak
---
she said, in surprise and
 genuine disappointment.
---
" Well, I've thought it best."
---
" I've had the refusal
---
I have reasons for giving up.
---
I shall
 finish out my year there as manager for the trustees,
 but no more."

---
" And what shall I do without you?
---
Oh, Gabriel, I
 do n't think.
---
I
 had fancied.
---
" I would have willingly."

---
that I am more helpless than ever you go
 away
---
at once went out of the churchyard by a
 path she could follow on no pretence whatever
---
Bathsheba went home,.
---
her mind occupied with a
 new trouble, which being rather harassing than deadly
 was calculated to do good by diverting her from the
 chronic gloom of her life
---
She was set; and
---
which, trivial when singly viewed
 amounted together to a perceptible disinclination for
 her society
---
It broke upon her at length as a great
 pain.
---
that her last old disciple was about to forsake her
 and flee
---
who had believed in her and and
---
when all the rest of the world was against her
---
She noticed
.
---
when she was likely

---
when
 her presence in that part of the house was least
---
Poor Bathsheba began.

---
she was

---
On examining her
 heart it appeared beyond measure strange that the sub-
 ject of which the season might have been supposed
 suggestive--.
---
Coming out of church that day she looked
 round in hope that Oak, whose bass voice she had
 heard rolling out from the gallery overhead in a most
 unconcerned manner
---
Bathsheba turn
---
;
 she had been expecting it long.
---
Bathsheba actually sat and.
---
She was aggrieved and
---
which she had

---
She was too by the prospect of having
 to rely on her own resources again
---
bewildered: it seemed to herself
.
---
that she never could again acquire energy sufficient to
 go to market, barter, and sell
---
What should
 she do now?
---
Her life was becoming a desolation.

---
So desolate was Bathsheba this evening,
---
that in an
 absolute hunger for pity and sympathy, and miserable in
 that she appeared
---
she had ever owned
---
to have outlived the only true friend-
 ship, she put on her bonnet and
 and.

---
She tapped nervously, and

---
for a single
 woman to call upon a bachelor who lived alone
---
she might be supposed
---
" said Bathsheba, faintly.

---
" Yes; I am Mr. Oak."
---
she said, in pathetic tones.

---
I suppose--
---
and I'll get a light."
---
So down she sat, and
---
In the fields, or at her house,
 there had never been any embarrassment; but
---
she asked, gladly."
---
" I am not going,
---
to emigrate; I was n't
 aware that you would wish me not to when I told' ee or I
 should n't ha' thought of doing it."
---
" What?" said Bathsheba, in surprise.
---
Bathsheba did not look quite so alarmed as if a
 cannon had been discharged by her ear, which was what
 Oak had expected.
---
I did n't know it
" she said, quietly."
---
I do n't desire any
 such thing
---
; I should think.
---
" I must beg your pardon for correcting you, but
---
" I beg your pardon too! she returned, with tears
 in her eyes."
---
she murmured.

---
she interrupted.
---
she exclaimed, thank-
 fully,.
---
as she rose from her seat
---
she said, with a slight
 laugh,
---
Those had been Bathsheba's words to Oak one
 evening, some time after the event of the preceding
 chapter, and
---
Bathsheba has a great wish that all
 the parish shall not be in church, looking at her--
---
she's
 shylike and nervous about it
---
" Labe Tall's old woman will horn it all over parish in
 half- an- hour."

---
" So she will, upon my life; I never thought of
 that."
---
how we could tackle her
---
She'll never guess; and
---
tis to witness her
 sign some law- work about taking shares wi' another
 farmer for a long span
---
before she could ask any further
---
" Liddy." said Bathsheba, on going to bed that night,

---
" I want
---
, In
 case I should n't wake."

---
" Yes, but I have something important to do,, and
---
which
 I'll tell you of when the time comes
---
Bathsheba, however, awoke voluntarily at four, nor
 could she by any contrivance get to sleep again.
---
that her watch had stopped
 during the night
---
, she could wait no longer.
---
She went
 and and after some labour awoke
 her.

---
" But I thought?"
---
said
 the bewildered Liddy.
---
I know.
---
Come to
 my room as soon; I want."

---
When Liddy came to Bathsheba's room her mistress

---
Liddy could not understand
 this extraordinary promptness.
---
"?" she said.

---
" Well, I'll tell you."
---
said Bathsheba, with a mischiev-
 ous smile in her bright eyes.
---
A woman's good name is
 such a perishable article that-- --"
 Bathsheba laughed with a flushed cheek, and
 whispered in Liddy's ear, although there was nobody
 present.
---
Then Liddy stared and," Souls
 alive, what news!
---
" said Bathsheba.

---
Yet, though so plainly dressed
 there was a certain rejuvenated appearance about her: --
   As though a rose should shut and be a bud again.

---
Repose had again incarnadined her cheeks; and
---
as
 she had worn it years ago on Norcombe Hill
---
, she seemed
 in his eyes remarkably like a girl of that fascinating
 dream,.
---
that she was now only three
 or four- and- twenty
---
The two sat down very quietly to tea in Bathsheba's
 parlour in the evening of the same day,.

---
whilst Bathsheba was, comparatively, in a plethora of all
 three
---
Just as Bathsheba was pouring out a cup of tea
---
followed by Bathsheba with a shawl over her head
---
Bathsheba smiled(), and
---
for she
 never laughed readily now
---
