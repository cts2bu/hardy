The old inhabitant was a tall,

And she opened upon him
 a lecture on how she would now have him all the spring upon her hands

More angry with Jude for demeaning her by coming there than for
 dereliction of duty, she rated him primarily from that point of view,
 and only secondarily from a moral one.

 of the romantic charms of the city of light and lore.

having; in front of
 it, beside the brook, three young women were kneeling, with buckets
 and platters beside them. 
---
She was a fine dark- eyed girl, not exactly
 handsome, but capable of passing as such at a little distance,
 despite some coarseness of skin and fibre. 
---
She had a round and
 prominent bosom, full lips, perfect teeth, and the rich complexion
 of a Cochin hen's egg. 
---
She was a complete and substantial female
 animal-- no more, no less; and
---
Perhaps she foresaw an opportunity
---
there was a momentary flash of intelligence, a dumb announcement of
 affinity_ in posse_ between herself and him,. 
---
She saw
.


---
as a woman is singled out
 in such cases, for no reasoned purpose of further acquaintance, but

---
Springing to her feet, she said:"."


---
As the girl drew nearer to it
---
, she gave without Jude
 perceiving it, an adroit little suck to the interior of each of her
 cheeks in succession. 
---
, by which curious and original manoeuvre she
 brought as by magic upon its smooth and rotund surface a perfect
 dimple, which she was able to retain there as long as she continued
 to smile
---
her to explain
---
why she had audaciously
 stopped him by this novel artillery instead of by hailing him
---
But she, slyly looking in another direction,
---
swayed herself backwards
 and forwards on her hand, she turned her eyes critically upon him.


---
I_ would shy things at you?"


---
She nodded towards the
 fragment on the grass.


---
", I wonder?"
---
these girls are helping."


---
which was uttered very distinctly
 by Arabella's personality
---
" What a nice- looking girl you are!"
---
" she said piquantly.


---
" I do n't suppose?
---
I could
---
She had spoken this without
 a smile, and
---
she had managed
---
She brightened with a little glow of triumph,.


---
Meanwhile the girl had joined her companions, and
---
she silently
 resumed her flicking and sousing of the chitterlings in the pellucid
 stream.


---
" Catched un, my dear?" laconically asked the girl called Anny.


---
regretfully murmured Arabella.


---
She would wait
 indoors, poor girl, and.

---
There was a something in her, too,. 
---
which lay between the village and the isolated
 house of Arabella in the dip beyond the upland
---
just as Arabella came downstairs
 in radiant walking attire
---
" at once,?" she whispered to Jude.


---
Arabella looked so handsome amid her untidy surroundings.


---
"," said Arabella. 
---
that they found themselves on the scene,--the
 distance being altogether about half- a- dozen miles from Marygreen,
 and three from Arabella's
---
Arabella said. 
---
she would like some tea, and
---
as she met the serious and
 tender gaze of her lover-- the low and triumphant laugh of a careless
 woman who sees
---
she is winning her game.


---
" I suppose," said Arabella.


---
I had forgotten that. 
---
Arabella tasted it. 
---
" Ugh!" she said.


---
She mentioned three or four
 ingredients that she detected in the liquor beyond malt and hops,
 much to Jude's surprise.


---
Nevertheless she returned to the beer and
---
She wondered, but
---
She took it, thoroughly, up to the shoulder. 
---
her right as it rested in its place
---
From
 this point the only way of getting to Arabella's was by going up the
 incline, and dipping again into her valley on the right. 
---
Arabella tittered lightly.


---
For answer she inclined her head upon his shoulder. 
---
as she had desired,
---
," she said gently.


---
how trusting she was
---
Thus they slowly went towards her home. 
---
She asked him and. 
---
as if she had been out alone in the dark

 woman without features or character; and bidding them all good night

Arabella soon re- asserted her
 sway in his soul. 
---
It was better to love a woman than to be a
 graduate, or a parson
---
his aunt had gone to bed, and
---
Arabella, on the contrary, made them public among all her friends
 and acquaintances.


---
She was
 not there now, and
---
" the embroidery of imagination upon the stuff of
 nature" so depicted her past presence. 
---
a half later Arabella came along the same way with her
 two companions of the Saturday. 
---
She passed unheedingly.


---
And she related almost word for word some of his
 tenderest speeches. 
---
In a few moments Arabella replied in a curiously low, hungry tone of
 latent sensuousness:! 
---
" I've got: yes
---
But I want
! 
---
him to more than care for me; I want
---
I
 must have him. 
---

 Arabella remained

 asked.


---
The third girl looked at the second. "
---
She DON'T

' Tis clear she do n't!
---
Arabella's companions looked at each other, and. 
---
Then one went up close to Arabella, and,

---
A woman had
---
Lots of girls do it; or
---
" A countryman that's honourable and serious- minded such as he; God
 forbid that I should say a sojer, or sailor, or commercial gent from
 the towns, or any of them that be slippery with poor women!  I'd do
 no friend that harm!"

" I own I did n't think of that
 way!...  I
 wish I had the chance!  do you think?"


---
Arabella pursued her way in silent thought. 
---
" I'll try it!" she
 whispered; but not to them.




---
a glimpse of Arabella
 that should not come into the reckoning of regular appointments
---
the top
 of her head moving quickly hither and thither over the garden hedge
---
that she
 was endeavouring unassisted
---
which
 she had set open
---
The lines of her countenance changed from the
 rigidity of business to the softness of love. 
---
when she saw Jude, and

---
she bent her eyes languishingly upon him
---
she cried,
---
said she. 
---
She rushed in full pursuit out of the garden, Jude alongside her,
. 
---
She gave him her now hot hand with apparent willingness,
 and
---
"," she remarked. 
---
" cried Arabella. 
---
Without relinquishing her hold of Jude's hand she swerved aside and
.


---
She lay supine, and. 
---
she went on
---
,", her form heaving
 and
---
, her face flushed,
---
her full red lips
 parted, and a fine dew of perspiration on her skin
---

---
," said she.


---
" No-- I ca n't see
 it
---
She gently pulled him down beside her.


---
"" she said crossly,.


---
" I do n't care, dear: why should I?
---
She rolled round her face,
---
Sha n't!" she said.


---
She kept her two lips resentfully together, and
---
till she slackened her pace and
---
Arabella went in,
.


---
I expect
---
I took too much liberty with her, somehow
---
On Sunday morning the interior of Arabella's home was, as usual,
 the scene of a grand weekly cooking, the preparation of the special
 Sunday dinner. 
---
her mother and Arabella herself were

---
A neighbour passed on her way home from
 morning service at the nearest church, and.


---
Donn engaged at
 the window with the razor,
---
She at once spoke playfully to Arabella
---
Arabella merely threw a look of consciousness into her face without
 raising her eyes.


---
When the gossip had departed Arabella
---
In the afternoon Arabella met and. 
---
"," said Arabella, who had attended to the sounds.


---
When they arrived at her house
---
" Wait a moment," said she. 
---
She tried the handle of the door and
.


---
"," she added. 
---
And searching behind the
 scraper she found the key and. 
---
" she asked lightly. 
---
She took off her jacket and hat,
 and
---
Do n't touch me, please," she said softly. 
---
" I am part egg- shell. Or

---
perhaps I had better put it in a safe place." 
---
She began.


---
said her lover.


---
She put her hand into her bosom and. 
---
Having exhibited it to him she put it back,

---
for a woman to want
---
She had turned round her chair, and,.


---
" she said defiantly,"!" 
---
I am without it now
---
She had quickly
 withdrawn the egg a second time; but. 
---
she had put it back as quickly,
---
Her face flushed; and.


---
But she had jumped up too. 
---
"" she cried.


---
Her lover followed her. 
---
as she withdrew
---
her to have rushed
 up the stairs, whither Jude rushed at her heels
---
Arabella seemed dissatisfied
---
; she
 was always imagining, and.


---
One day she met the itinerant Vilbert. 
---
She, like all the cottagers
 thereabout, knew the quack well, and
---
she began. 
---
Arabella had been gloomy, but. 
---
she
 had grown brighter
---
That evening she kept an appointment with Jude,
 who seemed sad.


---
I am going away
---
Arabella began. 
---
"?" she
 said. 
---
I haven't told you yet!"
---
and
 she looked into his face with streaming eyes.


---
" Oh, Arabella-- how can you say that, my dear! 
---
that
 Arabella was not worth a great deal as a specimen of womankind
---
Arabella's parents being among them
---
Fawley's aunt being a baker
---
she made him a bride- cake,; and
---
Of this cake Arabella took some slices,_
---
His wife was absolutely useless in
---
her
 keep a pig
---
Arabella, however, felt
---
;
 she had gained a husband
---
which Arabella wore
---
A long tail of
 hair, twisted up in an enormous knob at the back
 of her head, was deliberately unfastened,.


---
However, perhaps there
 was no great sin in a woman, and
---
A new- made wife can usually manage. 
---
There is a certain piquancy about her situation, and
 her manner to her acquaintance at the sense of it, which carries off
 the gloom of facts, and. 
---
when she
 met Anny her former friend, whom she had not seen since the wedding
---
Nevertheless it was with a little uneasiness that Arabella approached
 the time when in the natural course of things she would have to
 reveal that the alarm she had raised had been without foundation.

---
When she came into
 the room he was between sleeping and waking, and.


---
as she sat
---
that she
 was amusing herself by artificially producing in each cheek the
 dimple, a curious accomplishment of which
---
she was
 mistress,
---
She turned and. "
---
she
 said. 
---
that I know of
---
when
 I was at the public- house
---
" I do n't care about dimples. 
---
I do n't think of full- sized figure like
 you."


---
they improve a
 woman-- particularly a married woman, and
---
" I do n't care,. 
---
" I used."

" Ah. 
---
when I was serving in the tap- room
---
I thought."


---
when I married you
---
I was a little
 more finished than I could have been by staying where I was born
---
I was eating my head off
---
I
 went away for three months."


---
I made a mistake."


---
as I was, without a stick of
 furniture, and
---
Why, of course, so unprepared hardly a shilling, I should n't have hurried on our
 affair, and... 
---
before I was ready
---
" I have no more to say!"


---
she lost, for that matter,? 
---
I'm afraid the pig- killer wo n't be able to come
---
Jude's wife came downstairs.


---
" Is?" she asked.


---
She went out, and. 
---
Drunk last night, I expect. 
---
I'll show
 you how. 
---
Or I'll do it myself
---
-- I think. 
---
I could

Though I had

A robin peered down at the preparations
 from the nearest tree, and,,. 
---
By this time Arabella had joined
 her husband, and
---
Arabella opened the sty- door, and
---
Arabella bound him down,.


---
"!" she cried. 
---
" she cried,"! 
---
she
 had desired

" Make!" said Arabella. 
---

---
she cried, thoroughly in a passion. 
---
" Now I ca n't make any
 blackpot. 
---
" to know" she said scornfully. 
---
I know
---
, I know
---
glane" said Arabella. 
---
"," said Arabella,.

---
as his wife had called him, a tender- hearted fool
---
who had been Arabella's
 companions
---
One of the girls was talking to a friend in a she d, himself. 
---
' twas I put her up to it! '
---
Nothing venture nothing
 have,' I said.  If I had n't she'd no more have been his mis'ess than
 I."

"' Tis my belief she knew..."


---
when she told
 him
---
she was
---
What had Arabella been put up to by this woman? 
---
Arabella however, was busy
 melting down lard from fat of the deceased pig,. 
---
for she had been out
 on a jaunt all day, and
---
But Arabella was very talkative, and. 
---
that she wanted some money
---
Seeing the book sticking out of
 his pocket she added.


---
Her defensive manner collapsed. 
---
"," she said,
. 
---
" Every woman has a right to do such as that. 
---
" I quite deny it, Bella. 
---
She might if no lifelong penalty attached
 to it for the man, or,

But so far she should not go and."


---

---
" Then I must do it to- morrow morning. 
---
Next morning,, she resumed operations about ten
 o'clock; and.

As she warmed
---
she saw some of
 Jude's dear ancient classics on a table where they ought not to have
 been laid. 
---
I wo n't have them books here in the way!
---
"" she cried
 petulantly; and.


---
she began
---
her fingers consequently
 left very perceptible imprints on the book- covers. 
---
She continued
 deliberately,
 incensed beyond bearing,. 
---
her leave
 off
---
it rolled about her ears.


---
" Let!" she said.


---
She hesitated. 
---
" she repeated.

" Promise!"


---
After a pause:" I do."


---
she crossed the room to the door,
 out of which
---
she went with a set face, and into the highway. 
---
Here
 she began,. 
---
she
 now presented, bonnetless,. 
---
her dishevelled hair blowing in the wind
---
,
 her bodice apart, her sleeves rolled above her elbows for her work,
 and
---
" See!" she cried. 
---
not what she did
---
" she asked.

---
But she said no more,
 and. 
---
till she was tired
---
Aunt-- did
---
She raised her ancient eyes under the rim of the by- gone bonnet that
 she always wore. 
---
she said.


---
" I have heard."


---
so well, I s'pose
---
" You med; though your wife-- I reckon'! 
---
she-- must have been a fool to open up that
---
Your
 mother soon afterwards died

---
she so disliked. 
---
that she went
 away to London with her little maid
---
how Arabella would receive him in his
 new aspect
---
she would know
---
if she came back, and
---
she had not visited the
 house
---
Then there
 came a letter from her.


---
That she had gone tired of him
---
she frankly admitted. 
---
she did not care for the sort of life he
 led. 
---
She further went on. 
---
her parents had
---
she proposed. 
---
A woman of her sort would have more chance over there
 than in this stupid country.


---
since she wished,
---
that she might sell them with the rest, or as
 many of them as she should choose
---
She must have thrown it in with the
 rest of her property at the auction.


---
that Arabella and her parents had

---
she had said. 
---
since she was bent on going
---
Yet I am a man
---
who she
 was
---
His grand- aunt had gruffly replied on further
 questioning the old woman.


---
that she was his cousin
 Sue Bridehead, of the inimical branch of the family; and
---
that the girl lived in
 Christminster,
---
though she did not know where, or
---
what she was doing
---
His aunt would not give him the photograph. 
---
One of the spectres() was now apostrophizing her thus:

" Beautiful city!
---
Her ineffable charm
 keeps ever calling us to the true goal of all of us, to the ideal, to
 perfection."


---
Sir, I may be wrong
---
that I have exercised the
 powers committed to me from no corrupt or interested motives, from no
 desire to gratify ambition, for no personal gain
---
When I look upon the tombs of the great, every motion of envy dies
 in me
---
when I read the epitaphs of the beautiful
---
when I meet with the grief of parents upon a
 tombstone
---
when I see the tombs of
 the parents themselves
---
;, I consider the vanity of grieving for those
 whom we must quickly follow."


---
Teach me to live, that I may dread
      The grave as little as my bed.
     
---
By Jove-- I had quite forgotten my sweet- faced cousin, and
---
that she's
 here all the time!... and my old schoolmaster, too
---
She did so, with a request, however,. 
---
She seemed and
. 
---
the girl remained at Christminster. 
---
To
 make her still more objectionable, she was an artist or designer of
 some sort in what was called an ecclesiastical warehouse, which was
 a perfect seed- bed of idolatry, and.
---
she was
---
( Miss Drusilla
 Fawley was of her date, Evangelical.)


---
, this
 news of Sue's probable opinions did not much influence him one way or
 the other, but
---
the clue to her whereabouts was decidedly interesting.

---
to be kept entirely by women
---
; she was so
 pretty that he could not believe it possible that she should belong
 to him. 
---
Then she spoke to one of the two older women behind the
 counter; and
---
What was she doing?

---
Before her lay a piece of zinc, cut to
 the shape of a scroll three or four feet long, and. 
---
Hereon she was designing or
 illuminating, in characters of Church text
---
Her presence here was now. 
---
, her skill in
 work of this sort having
---
she was engaged
---
It would have been easy to speak to her there and then,
 but
---
She had used him roughly, but
---
she had

---
her being powerless to control him

---
She seemed
 so dainty beside himself in his rough working- jacket and dusty
 trousers. 
---
she had

---
which had resulted in his becoming
 enchained to one of her own sex whom she would certainly not admire
---
she was there
---
But she
 remained more or less an ideal character, about whose form he began
 to weave curious and fantastic day- dreams.


---
She looked right into his face with
 liquid, untranslatable eyes,. 
---
She no more observed his presence than that of
 the dust- motes which his manipulations raised into the sunbeams.


---
though she was a country- girl at bottom, a latter
 girlhood of some years in London, and a womanhood here
---
When she was gone
---
that she was not a large
 figure,
---
that she was light and slight, of the type dubbed elegant
---
There was nothing statuesque in her
---
She was mobile, living, yet
---
a painter might
 not have called her handsome or beautiful. 
---
that she was

---
She was quite a long way removed from the rusticity
 that was his. 
---
since there were
 crushing reasons why he should not and could not think of her in any
 other
---
;
 later on, to be invited to tea by, the emotion spent on her being
 rigorously that of a kinsman and well- wisher. 
---
So would she be to him
 a kindly star, an elevating power, a companion in Anglican worship,
 a tender friend.




---
that she frequently attended there
---
She did not come, and. 
---
if she came at all
---
that she would approach the
 building along the eastern side of the great green quadrangle from
 which
---
A few minutes before the hour for service she appeared as
 one of the figures walking along under the college walls, and
---
that Sue was among them
---
The girl to nourish an extraordinary
 tenderness was at this time; and
---
She was probably a frequenter of this place, and
---
as she must be by occupation and habit
---
till she had left her seat and
---
She did not look towards him, and
---
by the
 time she was half- way down the broad path.

---
She was such a stranger
---
Still
 Sue WAS his own kin, and the fact of his having a wife,
---
even though
 she was not in evidence in this hemisphere
---
Some little time before the date of this service in the cathedral the
 pretty, liquid- eyed, light- footed young woman, Sue Bridehead, had an
 afternoon's holiday, and
---
in
 which she not only assisted but
---
She went along for
 a mile or two. 
---
until she came to much higher ground than that of the
 city she had left behind her
---
Sue paused there,
---
she was
 reading,
---
On the other side of the stile, in the footpath, she beheld a
 foreigner with black hair and a sallow face,
---
They were in the main reduced copies of ancient marbles, and
 comprised divinities of a very different character from those the
 girl was accustomed to see portrayed, among them being a Venus of
 standard pattern, a Diana, and, of the other sex, Apollo, Bacchus,
 and Mars. 
---
Though the figures were many yards away from her
---
that she could discern their contours with luminous
 distinctness; and
---
being almost in a line between herself and the
 church towers of the city they awoke in her an oddly foreign and
 contrasting set of ideas by comparison. 
---
She shook her head.


---
?" she said,.


---
she should have them for ten shillings
---
," said Sue. 
---
She offered considerably less,
 and to her surprise
---
She clasped them as treasures.


---
, she began. 
---
what she should do with them
---
that they were in her possession, and so very naked
---
she trembled at her enterprise.

---
When she handled them the white pipeclay
---
After carrying them along a little way openly an idea came
 to her, and,
---
pulling some huge burdock leaves, parsley, and other
 rank growths from the hedge, she wrapped up her burden as well as she
 could in these,.


---
what she carried
---
"!" she
 said. 
---
But she was still in a trembling state, and.


---
she had not bought the figures
---
Occasionally peeping inside the leaves to see not broken, she entered with her heathen load into the most Christian
 city in the country by an obscure street and
---
she was attached. 
---
Her purchases were taken straight up to her
 own chamber, and but.


---
she at once attempted;
---
that was
 her very own property
---
she wrapped
 them in large sheets of brown paper, and
---
dressed almost like an abbess; a dab at Ritual, as become
 one of her business, and a worshipper at the ceremonial church of St.
 Silas, in the suburb of Beersheba before- mentioned,. 
---
She was the daughter of a clergyman in reduced
 circumstances, and
---
at his death,, she boldly avoided penury by taking over a little
 shop of church requisites and developing it to its present creditable
 proportions. 
---
She wore a cross and beads, and.


---
She now came,.


---
that the girl did not
 respond for a moment
---
" she asked,
.


---
" Yes-- just something to ornament my room," said Sue.


---
Well, I should have thought
---
I had put enough here already
---
She tore a little hole, about as big as a wafer,
 in the brown paper, and. "
---
when she was sure of being
 undisturbed
---
These little obstacles to the indulgence of the merest
 passing fancy created in Sue a great zest for unpacking her objects
 and looking at them; and at bedtime,, she unrobed the divinities in comfort. 
---
Placing the pair
 of figures on the chest of drawers, a candle on each side of them,
 she withdrew to the bed,. 
---
she had taken from her box, which Miss Fontover knew
 nothing of
---
she read the chapter
 dealing with the reign of Julian the Apostate. 
---
Occasionally she
 looked up at the statuettes, which appeared strange and out of place,
 and,

---
, she at length jumped up and
!



---
which she read to the end. 
---
Presently she put out the candles,
 undressed, and.


---
She was of an age which usually sleeps soundly, yet
---
to- night she
 kept, and
---
every time she opened her eyes
---
that Sue was tossing and

---
At the very time staring at her figures, might have heard,
---
till the service was half over that one of the women

---
which she could
 hardly refuse
---
Surrounded by her influence all day,
---
she frequented
---
she was almost an ideality to him still
---
her would be
---
For Sue to be the loved one
 of a man who was licensed by the laws of his country to love Arabella
 and none other unto his life's end
---
that she is exceptionally bright; and
---
For whatever Sue's virtues, talents, or
 ecclesiastical saturation, it was certain.


---
On an afternoon at this time a young girl entered the stone- mason's
 yard with some hesitation, and,.


---
That's a nice girl
---
Who is she?
---
Why, yes, she's
 the daughter of that clever chap Bridehead who did all the wrought
 ironwork at St. Silas' ten years ago, and. 
---
as
 she's come back here
---
Meanwhile the young woman had knocked at the office door and. 
---
she was out of sight. 
---
Sue's was of the most artless and natural kind. 
---
She addressed him
 as her dear cousin Jude
---
she had only just learnt by the merest
 accident that he was living in Christminster, and
---
her know
---
,
 she said,. 
---
for she was thrown much upon herself, and
---
But now there was every probability of her soon
 going away,.


---
that she was going away.

---
Arabella had been met in the same way, unfortunately, and
---
it might
 not seem respectable to a dear girl like Sue. 
---
she called out to him:


---
till she showed signs of closing in,,
---
," she said with the freedom of a friend. 
---
" I
 have really no place to ask anybody in to. 
---
What I meant
---
I suppose
---
I ought
---
I
 mean
---
when I do n't know you yet
---
She looked him
 up and down curiously,.


---
than I know you
---
" to know me more," she added.


---
" Yes-- I have seen you now and then."


---
who I was
---
And now I am going away!"


---
I have hardly any other friend. 
---
I have,
 indeed, one very old friend here somewhere, but I do n't quite like
 to call on him just yet. 
---
I wonder.

---
I think
---
" No-- I only know of one Mr. Phillotson. 
---
I wonder. 
---
; I've directed books to him,."


---
though I've never seen him
---
She agreed, and
---
the rays fell on the nervous little face and vivacious
 dark eyes and hair of Sue, on the earnest features of her cousin,
 and on the schoolmaster's own maturer face and figure,
---
She was so
 vibrant that everything she did seemed to have its source in feeling.

---
her walk ahead so fast that he could
 hardly keep up with her
---
her sensitiveness on some points
 was such that it might have been misread as vanity. 
---
the gloom of the walk home
 lay not in the night overhead, but in the thought of her departure.

"
---
She laughed.


---
"," she continued. 
---
" She broke some statuary of mine."


---
She found it in my room, and!"


---
she
 threw it on the floor and
---
because it was not according
 to her taste, and
---
No doubt she called them
 popish images and."


---
No, she did n't do that. 
---
She saw the matter quite
 differently."


---
It was for quite some other reason that she did n't like my
 patron- saints. 
---
her see
---
she has

---
-- she has,
---
Oh has she? 
---
Does she really think of
 adopting teaching as a profession?"


---
she was disposed
---
this step as the first stage of an apprenticeship, of which her
 training in a normal school would be the second stage
---
, her time would
 be wasted
---
that
 she had agreed
---
Sue had
 been taken as stop- gap. 
---
Having taught for
 some two years in London, though she had abandoned. 
---
that vocation of
 late, Miss Bridehead was not exactly a novice, and
---
though she had only been with him three or four
 weeks
---
her cross the road to the school
---
At twenty minutes to nine she did cross
---
, a light hat tossed
 on her head; and
---
which had nothing to do with her skill as a teacher
---
Sue
 remained governing her class at the other end of the room, all day
 under his eye
---
She certainly was an excellent teacher.


---
some article in the Code made it necessary that a respectable,
 elderly woman should be present at these lessons when the teacher and
 the taught were of different sexes. 
---
whose house
 Sue lodged
---
where Mrs. Hawes, the widow at, occupied herself with sewing
---
as she figured
---
-- she would involuntarily glance up with a little inquiring smile
 at him,. 
---
as if she assumed
---
Perhaps she
 knew.


---
"," said Sue to the schoolmaster,. 
---
as she stood with him a
 little in the background,"
---
I am sure this man does n't."


---
I fancy
---
"," she said,". 
---
" But my dear girl, consider!"


---
She was silent,. 
---
for she was easily repressed; and
---
" Ah-- I did n't see him!
---
" she cried in her quick, light voice.

---
Your cousin is so terribly clever that she criticizes it
 unmercifully
---
" She is
 quite sceptical as to its correctness."


---
what is
 called a clever girl
---
She impulsively
 seized his hand, and. 
---
her voice revealing a tremor which she herself
 felt to be absurdly uncalled for by sarcasm so gentle
---
She had.


---
how the hearts of the twain went out to her at
 this momentary revelation of feeling, and
---
she was

---
, when there would be no lessons to
 give to Sue, and
---
Her Majesty's school- inspector was at that time; and
---
But Sue's class was at the further end of the room, and
---
her back was
 towards the entrance
---
her teaching some half- minute
---
before she became aware
 of his presence
---
She turned, and. 
---
The effect upon her timidity was such that she uttered a
 cry of fright. 
---
her
 falling from faintness
---
She soon recovered herself, and;
 but
---
she was
 so white that Phillotson took her into his room, and gave her some
 brandy to bring her round. 
---
She found.


---
" to have told me," she gasped petulantly,"! 
---
that she was moved, and
---
that she
 had upbraided him
---
When she was better
---
she went home.


---
Sue would like,
---
that they were Sue and Phillotson
---
The
 latter was holding the umbrella over her head, and
---
whereupon she gently removed it
---
she let
---
She did

---
till they had reached Sue's cottage and
---
she had passed in,

VI


 Jude's old and embittered aunt lay unwell at Marygreen, and
---
His aunt was now unable to leave her bed, and
---
with the
 proceeds of this and her savings she was comfortably supplied with
 necessaries and more,
---
a widow of the same village living with her and
 ministering to her wants. 
---
Was Sue born here?"


---
" She was-- in this room. 
---
" Now you've been seeing her!"
---
said the harsh old woman. 
---
" And what
 did I tell' ee?"

" Well-- that I was not."

" Have you gossiped with her?"


---
She was brought up by her father; and
---
she'll look with no favour upon a working chap
 like you-- a townish girl by now. 
---
as she's become
---
what she was too often, with
 her tight- strained nerves
---
Why, one day when she was walking into the pond with
 her shoes and stockings off, and her petticoats
---
I never cared much
 about her.  I've smacked her for her
 impertinence pulled above her
 knees, afore I could cry out for shame, she said:'!

---
" She was a little child then."


---
" She was twelve if a day."


---
But now she's older
---
she's of a thoughtful,
 quivering, tender nature, and as sensitive as--"

" Jude!"
---
" Do n't you be a fool
 about her!"


---
But she's gone to
 the other side of the world, and
---
for' ee to give her
---
If she's
 townish and wanton
---
for
 she began a commentary on past years,
---
She described
---
what an odd little
 maid Sue had been
---
-- how,, she appeared on the platform, the
 smallest of them all," in her little white frock, and shoes, and pink
 sash"
---
how she recited" Excelsior,
---
how during the delivery she would knit her
 little brows and glare round tragically, and
---
She'd bring up the nasty carrion bird that clear
---
as she stood there in her little sash and
 things
---
The neighbour told also of Sue's accomplishments in other kinds:

"
---
She was not exactly a tomboy
---
; but she could do things that
 only boys do, as a rule. 
---
I've seen. 
---
her hit in and and up the back slide without stopping
---
her little curls blowing, one of
 a file of twenty moving along against the sky like shapes painted
 on glass
---
and then they'd cheer her, and
---
in which Sue's little figure had so glorified
 itself;
---
When I was there once for an hour
---
I did n't see much in it for my
 part
---
As I say
---
, I did n't see
 nothing of it the hour or two
---
I was there
---
; so I went in and. 
---
, I suppose?"


---
After all, she had only known
 a little part of the miserable struggle in which he had been engaged
 thus unequipped, poor, and unforeseeing.


---
Without her it was
 inevitable. 
---
But the schoolmaster had been since
 blest with the consolation of sweet Sue,.


---
She laid it down. 
---
The spirit of Sue seemed. 
---
the maid stood
 still, Jude's voice echoing sonorously into the inner parlour, where
 the landlord was dozing, and bringing him out to see what was going
 on. 
---
She must have recognized his voice, for the light
---
Sue appeared with a candle in her hand.


---
With, she led him indoors, and
---
She asked him, but
---
that she would come down early
 in the morning and
---
get him some breakfast, she bade him good- night
 and.


---
She knew the worst of him-- the very worst. 
---
She would soon be coming down, and
---
as she had said,
---
on which she had hung
 it
---
attended by the woman who lived with her
---
her speaking of him
---
" My aunt has mentioned
 you more than once. 
---
" For there was no other girl, O bridegroom,
     like her!"--SAPPHO( H. T. Wharton).



---
-- was created
 by a letter from Sue,
---
She evidently
 wrote with anxiety, and. 
---
more
 than that she had passed some sort of examination for a Queen's
 Scholarship, and
---
she had chosen
---
while at the same time Sue was even less than formerly as proper
---
Sue had gone to the Melchester
 Normal School. 
---
She had acquiesced so readily that he wished he had not
 proposed it-- she evidently did not much care about him, though she
 had never once reproached him for his strange conduct in coming to
 her that night, and his silent disappearance. 
---
she ever
 said a word about her relations with Mr. Phillotson.


---
Suddenly, however, quite a passionate letter arrived from Sue.

---
She was quite lonely and miserable
---
, she told him. 
---
She hated the
 place she was in
---
She felt utterly friendless
---
she would only be able to
 see him at limited times
---
, the rules of the establishment she found
 herself in being strict to a degree. 
---
she wished.


---
she had never listened to
 him
---
; the girl with the kindling glance,
 daringly soft at times-- something like that of the girls seen in engravings from paintings of the Spanish school. 
---
She was
 here-- actually in this Close-- in one of the houses confronting this
 very west façade.


---
in a few
 minutes she came
---
Though she had been here such a short while
---
, she was not. 
---
All her bounding manner was gone
---
; her curves of
 motion had become subdued lines. 
---
as I
 was-- and going so shamefully, Sue?
---
" Oh, I have tried not to
---
She wore a murrey- coloured gown with a little lace collar. 
---
which formerly she had worn
---
Her hair, according to the
 custom of the day was now twisted up tightly, and
---
she had altogether
 the air of a woman.


---
She had come forward prettily, but
---
that she had hardly
 expected him,
---
that Sue regarded him as a lover, or
---
that
 she knew the worst of him,
---
Sue came out into the town with him, and
---
then she confessed,
 with something of shame,
---
that she was dreadfully hungry
---
she most desired in the world
---
She told him about the school
---
the mixed character of her fellow- students, gathered
 together from all parts of the diocese, and. 
---
how she had
---
what she did not tell
---
; she looked up
 and.


---
as if they were the
 fingers of a glove she was purchasing
---
I hope I shall never have any doubt of your worthiness,
 my poor Jude!  And I am glad you have come!"

"?" she said.


---
I do n't dislike it
---
I think... 
---
Well, I'm rather glad I came
 to this training- school, after all. 
---
how independent I shall be
 after the two years' training
---
I shall pass pretty high
---
, I expect,
 and."


---
She had touched the subject at last. 
---
" I had a suspicion, a fear,"

---
Her ever- sensitive lip began, and.


---
her to say
---
said she, with the perverseness that was
 part of her. 
---
what I have done
---
I have promised--
---
I
 have promised--
---
that I will marry him
---
when I come out of the
 training- school two years hence, and
---
Sue regarded him
 passively without moving.


---
" I knew!"
---
she said with an air of no emotion
 whatever. 
---
" Very well-- I am wrong
---
, I suppose! 
---
I ought! 
---
as she
 probably knew, and
---
She was something of a riddle to him, and
---
," she answered, a remnant of vexation still in her voice.

---
as I
 have done these last few years
---
I am not
 modern, either. 
---
I am more ancient than mediævalism,."


---
There-- I wo n't say any more of that!"
---
she cried. 
---
how bad I am
---
, then I must go in, or
---
I shall be

---
Her reproach had taken that shape, then, and not the shape of words.

---
" I have leave from three till nine. 
---
Not ruins, Jude-- I do n't care for them."


---
I hate Gothic!"


---
, I
 think; with a lot of pictures."


---
I like the sound of Corinthian. 
---
for her; her
 emergence in a nunlike simplicity of costume than desired; the traipsing along to the station, the porters'
" B'your leave
---
Nobody stared at Sue,. 
---
because
 she was
---
which had no connection
 with her real life or her real self
---
" said she.


---
Sue paused patiently beside
 him, and
---
When she had thoroughly estimated him at this
---
, she would move on and
. 
---
that her
 cousin deeply interested her, as one
---
that would intensify the sense of her
 day's freedom,
---
Sue, inclined for any adventure readily agreed; and away
---
during the next half- mile
 Sue seemed, and
---
his mother's and his, pointing to a little dip ahead from which a
 faint blue smoke arose,
---
admitted by an old woman
 without a single tooth, to whom
---
" You can bide here over the night-- can't'em, Mother?

---
Well then, she can go into
 Mother's room, and
---
" I rather like this," said Sue,. 
---
An urban miss is.
---
She looked severe disagreement, and.


---
in which she was again
---
the gables of the old building to
 be immured rose before Sue's eyes
---
walked to the
 Close, and, she looked a little scared. 
---
"!" she murmured.


---
," she
 said quickly,
---
She passed
 in,.




---
The seventy young women, of ages varying in the main from nineteen to
 one- and- twenty, though several were older,. 
---
that Sue Bridehead had not come in at closing- time
---
She went out with her young man
---
She'll have it hot."


---
when she does come
---
She said,.


---
" to be
 effectual in saving our souls," said the head girl of the year,
 drily.


---
that, only twelve months before, there had occurred
 a lamentable seduction of one of the pupils who had made the same
 statement in order to gain meetings with her lover
---
, Sue's being pronounced three
 times sonorously by Miss Traceley without eliciting an answer
---
every girl's thought was,? 
---
Where is Sue Bridehead
---
which remained empty, and
 at her little dressing- table at the foot,
---
Sue's table had a moderate
 show,.


---
" did she ever say?"
---
" One-- the middle- aged man," said a student in the next bed--"is the
 schoolmaster she served under-- Mr.
---
She has never told his name."


---
Was it either of these two who came for her?"


---
till they fell asleep the
 girls indulged in conjectures about Sue, and
---
what games
 she had carried on in London and
---
before she came
 here, some of the more restless ones getting out of bed and looking
 from the mullioned windows at the vast west front of the cathedral
 opposite, and the spire rising behind it
---
they glanced into Sue's nook,
. 
---
When, accordingly, Sue came into the dormitory.

---
to hastily tidy
 herself, looking flushed and tired, she went to her cubicle in
 silence,
---
that she did not follow them
 into the dining- hall to breakfast, and
---
that she had
 been severely reprimanded, and
---
Towards evening, dictating her
 subject, the girls in the class sat with folded arms.


---
We are willing to take her word
---
"," said the head girl.


---
the mistress left
 the room to inquire from her superiors what was to be done.


---
Presently, towards dusk, the pupils, heard exclamations
 from the first- year's girls in an adjoining classroom, and
---
that Sue Bridehead had got out of the back window of the
 room in which she had been confined,
---
How she had managed.


---
she was
. 
---
She must have walked through the river!
---
" Or drownded herself," said the porter.


---
The mind of the matron was horrified-- not so much at the possible
 death of Sue as at the possible half- column detailing that event in
 all the newspapers,.


---
, some
 little boot- tracks were discerned in the mud, which left no doubt
 that the too excitable girl had waded through a depth of water
 reaching nearly to her shoulders-- for this.

---
As Sue had not brought disgrace upon the school by drowning herself
---
that she was gone
---
that contained Sue
---
that she could enter easily enough
---
that she
 had fled to him in her trouble
---
in a moment she appeared in
 the light of his lamp
---
she
 was clammy as a marine deity, and
---
that her clothes clung to her like
 the robes upon the figures in the Parthenon frieze
---
Can I come up without being seen?"

" I'm so cold!" she said through her chattering teeth. 
---
" Can I come by
 your fire, Jude?"


---
She crossed to his little grate and very little fire, but
---
as the
 water dripped from her
---
as she moved
---
, the idea of drying herself was
 absurd. 
---
She had begun the explanation in her
 usual slightly independent tones, but
---
before she had finished
---
the
 thin pink lips trembled, and.

" Dear Sue!
---
she could hardly refrain from crying
---
her know,
---
On two other chairs before the
 fire were her wet garments.
---
She blushed.


---
They are only a woman's
 clothes-- sexless cloth and linen... 
---
She
 gasped a little, but, and.


---
She then began; but
---
in the middle of her story her voice faltered,

---
her head nodded, and. 
---
she ceased
---
She was in a sound sleep. 
---
lest she should have caught a chill which might
 permanently injure her
---
that a warm flush now rosed
 her hitherto blue cheeks, and
---
that her hanging hand was no
 longer cold
---
When she had descended
---
Suddenly she said," Jude!"


---
Why, I fell asleep,
---
did n't I? 
---
What SHALL I do!
---
" she said,.


---
what I want
---
But I do n't know! 
---
" I am going, and
---
I haven't. 
---
I'm
 all right. 
---
Look here, what I have got for you. 
---
When she had sat
---
Some supper."

 upright she breathed plaintively and. 
---
I do

---
I thought; and
---
I was well
---
I ought not
---
to be
 here, ought I?" 
---
But the supper fortified her somewhat, and.


---
when she
 had had some tea and
---
again she was bright and cheerful
---
for she seemed
 preternaturally wakeful afterwards,
---
she said,. 
---
I am a sort of negation of
 it."


---
Do I strike you as being learned?
---
" she asked, with a touch
 of raillery.

"
---
Only you do n't talk quite like a girl--
---
" I have had advantages. 
---
I do n't know Latin and Greek,. 
---
though I know
 the grammars of those tongues
---
But I know most of the Greek and
 Latin classics through translations, and other books too. 
---
I read
 Lemprière, Catullus, Martial, Juvenal, Lucian, Beaumont and Fletcher,
 Boccaccio, Scarron, De Brantôme, Sterne, De Foe, Smollett, Fielding,
 Shakespeare, the Bible, and other such; and."


---
Well," she said thoughtfully,". 
---
I have no
 fear of men, as such, nor of their books.
---
I have mixed with them-- one
 or two of them particularly-- almost as one of their own sex. 
---
I mean

---
I have not felt about them
---
as most women are taught
---
unless she invites him
---
Until she says by a look
'
---
what I was going
---
when I
 was eighteen
---
that I formed a friendly intimacy with an undergraduate at
 Christminster, and
---
which
 I should never have got hold of otherwise
---
", I suppose?"


---
she said, a contralto note of
 tragedy coming suddenly into her silvery voice. 
---
I would n't have

---
if I had known
---
" No, I am not. 
---
" Well, I invested his money, poor fellow, in a bubble scheme, and
. 
---
I lived about London by myself for some time, and
---
then I
 returned to Christminster,; and
---
I got that occupation in the artist- shop where you found
 me... 
---
she, with an ostensible sneer, though he could hear
---
that she was

---
But some women would not have remained.
---
Better women would not. 
---
; she seemed.


---
?" she suddenly asked, in
 a voice of such extraordinary tenderness
---
who had just told her story so lightly
---
" I
 would rather offend anybody in the world than you!"


---
, I think
---
" I do n't know. 
---
whether I am vexed or not
---
I know!"


---
I care very much
 about you
---
" I care as much for you as for anybody I ever met."


---
There, I ought. 
---
that she was treating
 him cruelly
---
Her very
 helplessness seemed.


---
I am awfully ignorant on general matters,
---
although I have worked so
 hard
---
Oh no, no," she answered,"
---
I would rather not, if you do n't mind.

---
I should seem so-- such a hypocrite."


---
" I thought, so. 
---
I did n't propose it
---
that I hope

" To be ordained, I think

I fondly thought at first.
 whatever, except, in a qualified
 degree, on its intellectual side," said Sue Bridehead earnestly. 
---
I spoke of
---
when I was in my
 saddest
---
I always felt,


   ' O ghastly glories of saints, dead limbs of gibbeted Gods
---
she turned her face away.


---
" I still think." 
---
; though I
 was resentful
---
because I could n't get there
---
," she said, perverse still at his differing
 from her. 
---
" Well, I can do without what it confers. 
---
I care for something
 higher."


---
" And I for something broader, truer," she insisted. 
---
she
 turned the conversation to some generalizations about the offending
 university
---
she would not enlighten
 him.

"
---
just what I am, too
---
" she murmured.


---
she added,
.

---
she replied, in the tone of a child who was going to be good for ever
 after, turning her back upon him accordingly. 
---
during his retreat she
 took it up, and.


---
" come back to her;
" will you let like the one I made
 for myself at Christminster?"


---
," she said,
---
as she glanced
 into the pages of Solomon's Song
---
I mean
---
Then I wo n't say any more, except that people have no
 right to falsify the Bible! 
---
I HATE such hum- bug!" 
---
" I WISH; but
---
I had a friend here
---
But my dear Sue, my very dear Sue, I am not against you
---
her introducing personal feeling
 into mere argument
---
" she cried,. 
---
Whither is, O thou fairest among women
---
The Church
 professeth her faith_
---
YOU are fairest among women to me
---
Sue replied,. 
---
her voice changing
 to its softest note of severity
---
" I wo n't disturb your convictions-- I really wo n't!
---
" she went on
 soothingly,
---
I did

---
when I saw you,
 and
---
knew to be my comrade, I-- shall I confess it?--thought

---
that
 I do n't know
---
" Well, dear; I suppose.

I take Christianity."


---
Indeed I might. 
---
Perhaps I have done so!" 
---
" I wo n't ask what," 
---
She
 looked up trustfully, and
---
her voice seemed.


---
" I shall always care for you!
---
But Sue was so
 dear!... 
---
, as she
 seemed
---
to be able to do so easily of his, what a comrade she would
 make
---
She
 was nearer to him than any other woman he had ever met, and
---
till she
 fell asleep again
---
that her clothes were dry
---
Her chair being a far more comfortable
 one
---
than his she still slept on inside his great- coat,. 
---
her
 and touching her on the shoulder
---
she was dressed as usual.


---
?" she asked. 
---
" Oh, I do n't want any! 
---
I fear! 
---
I ought
---
I do n't know
---
that I went there
---
I hope; but
---
dreadfully, I expect
---
" I'll go to him and explain--".

"
---
I do n't care for him! 
---
I shall do
---
just as I choose
---
if I did
---
" But you just this moment said--"

" Well,, I shall do for all him! 
---
as I like
---
I have thought of
. 
---
what I shall do
---
She has a school
 near Shaston, about eighteen miles from here-- and
---
Sue still
 seemed sorry for her rashness, and. 
---
she had not rebelled
---
that she would let as soon as she
 got
---
" Jude," she said. 
---
" I know one of them. 
---
waving her pretty hand to
 him she vanished away
---
The next morning there came a letter from her,
 which, with her usual promptitude, she had written. 
---
directly she had

---
She told him of her safe arrival and
 comfortable quarters, and then added:--


   
---
What I really write about, dear Jude,
---
that I felt what a cruel and
    ungrateful woman I was to say it, and. 
---
Now I wo n't write any more about that. 
---
You do forgive your
    thoughtless friend for her cruelty? and.



---
which should have
 rendered a long residence with a female friend quite unnecessary for
 Sue
---
that she would
 write again
---
that she was ill from her
 immersion
---
A little girl opened the door. "
---
Miss Bridehead is up- stairs
---
," she
 said. 
---
" And will you please walk up to her?"


---
" Is she ill?
---
her lying in a little bed in a room a dozen feet
 square
---
" she answered. 
---
" I did catch a bad cold-- but
---
I
 could have written. 
---
Only I would n't!"


---
what I was afraid of
---
But I had decided. 
---
why I
 could n't write
---
She did not answer directly. 
---
I vowed
---
" I never would tell you,
 Jude--!"


---
There-- now I have told you, and
---
I wish
---
I had n't!"


---
" I do n't think of you! 
---
I do
---
I had n't begun to. 
---
I HAVE
 recognized,. 
---
if I had reckoned upon marrying you
---
why, of course,
 I should n't have come to you so
 often
---
And I never supposed
---
when I began
---
Perhaps I ought. 
---
" I was so blind at first!"
---
she went on. 
---
" I did n't see. 
---
I'll never trust you again!"


---
She turned her eyes doubtfully towards him, and.


---
she might forgive him
---
" Yes," she said shortly,. 
---
her face changing a little
---
Though I
 did n't ask him
---
But I should n't care!"


---
," she said decisively.


---
Sue's kind hostess now returned from church, and
---
that she was rather unreasonable,
---
which she must
 have written almost immediately
---
I was horrid to
    you
---
; I know it, and
---
I feel perfectly miserable at my
    horridness. 
---
I'll try.

   
---
I am coming to Melchester on Saturday,,&.



---
c.  I could walk with you for half
    an hour,
---
if you would like?--Your repentant

    SUE
---
when she came
---
if she chose
---
since she would not marry him offhand
---
About the time entering on adventures at the latter place with Sue, the
 schoolmaster was settling down in the new school- house at Shaston.

---
In one of
 them-- quite a recent note-- the young woman said.
---
that she had received
 his considerate letter, and
---
than she desired
---
( the
 school being such an awkward place for callers, and because of her
 strong wish)
---
who loved her
---
There
 was another of her as a young woman, her dark eyes and hair. 
---
that lay behind her lighter moods
---
Sue had, in fact, never written a line to her suitor on the subject,
. 
---
that the reputed culprit, Sue's lover Jude, was one amongst them
---
as she
 had promised; and
---
Sue, saw, moreover, to speak to him,
 he felt no little embarrassment;.


---
" I wo n't keep you long. 
---
that I have heard
---
I merely want."


---
" I think!" 
---
I know what
---
her escaping
 from the training school
---
her coming to me?"


---
that Sue had irretrievably committed herself with him
---
was simply that he loved her.

"
---
which
 led to her rustication
---
no Sue
 appeared
---
she had

---
" to get my things from the college," she said-- an
 observation which he was expected to take as an answer, though it was
 not one. 
---
" I have not. 
---
But I am not going; and

---
I wo n't answer!"


---
she, smiling with quick
 curiosity
---
Well; but I feel just the same about
 you, Jude. 
---
I seem such a coldhearted--"


---
As she knew his sentiment towards her Jude
---
she continued:
---
" I have never told you--"

".


---
I mean
---
", I have never told you my history-- all of it."


---
" But I guess it. 
---
I know nearly."


---
Could she possibly know of that morning performance
 of his with Arabella;? 
---
that she did not
---
" I ca n't quite tell you here in the street
---
which merely led up to the
 information that he had married a wife some years earlier
---
that
 his wife was living still
---
Almost before her countenance had time to
 change
---
she hurried out the words,

"
---
" I could n't.
---
she withdrew it. 
---
She was his comrade,
 friend, unconscious sweetheart no longer; and
---
I was ashamed of the episode in my life
---
" I ca n't explain it precisely now. 
---
I could
 have done it!"


---
can I?
---
" she burst out. 
---
" Here I have been saying, or
 writing,
---
!" she said,.


---
I never thought
---
; so I felt! 
---
how I mean?--I do n't like' out of charity
---
It was a question which in the circumstances Sue did not choose to
 answer.


---
I suppose
---
she-- your wife-- is-- a very pretty woman,
---
even if she's
 wicked
---
"?" she asked quickly.


---
" She's pretty enough, as far as that goes."


---
than I am
---
And I have never seen her for
 years... 
---
But she's sure
---
" How strange of you to stay apart from her like this!" said Sue,
 her trembling lip and lumpy throat belying her irony. 
---
I mean
---
Now if I had done such a thing
---
for I at least do n't regard marriage as a sacrament
---
When she saw
---
she softened, and
---
I had before that moment at the railway- station, except--" 
---
For
 once Sue was as miserable as he, in her attempts to keep herself free
 from emotion, and her less than half- success.


---
I am
---
because I meant
---
" No, no!" she said,. 
---
she showed. 
---
herself recovered
---
less had she
 appeared anyhow
---
as she did appear; essentially large- minded and
 generous on reflection, despite a previous exercise of those narrow
 womanly humours on impulse that were necessary to give her sex
---
" I do n't blame you for what you could n't help
---
," she said,.

---
" How should I be so foolish? 
---
I do blame you a little bit for not
 telling me before. 
---
that I must have loved you
---
wanted to be your
 wife,," said Sue, with a gentle
 seriousness which did not reveal her mind. 
---
And-- I am engaged to somebody
 else. 
---
Her being able to talk learnedly showed.


---
that she was mistress of
 herself again; and
---
she had almost regained her
 vivacious glance, her reciprocity of tone, her gay manner, and her
 second- thought attitude of critical largeness towards others of her
 age and sex
---
She said."


---
she said with nervous
 lightness. 
---
till I had gone through my course of training
    and
---
, now I am not at the training
    school
---
I say, and you must n't
    refuse!--Your affectionate cousin,

    SUSANNA FLORENCE MARY BRIDEHEAD
---
And yet, what
 could the poor girl do?
---
Sue was not a very practical or calculating person;
 and
---
that had moved her,
---
Sue had, in fact, been
 placed in an awkward corner. 
---
If Sue had written
---
Sue also thanked him. 
---
who had been one cause of Sue's unpleasant
 experience as for the sake of room
---
Then Sue wrote.


---
that she should come into residence on the
 following Saturday,
---
She arrived by the ten o'clock train on the day aforesaid,,
---
to meet her at the station,, she said(. 
---
if this were
 her true reason)
---
that the
 remembrance of their mutual sensitiveness at emotional crises might have weighed with her in this
---
she had taken possession of her apartment.


---
She lived in the same house with him, but on a different floor, and

---
each other little, an occasional supper being the only meal
 they took together, when Sue's manner was something like that of a
 scared child
---
What she felt
---
though she did not look pale or ill
---
On the morning of the
 wedding, Sue and her cousin
 had breakfast together for the first and last time during this
 curious interval; in his room-- the parlour-- which he had hired for
 the period of Sue's residence. 
---
as women do
---
, she bustled about.


---
I have nobody else who could
    do it so conveniently I have here on the spot.  I hope?  I have been looking at the marriage service in
    the prayer- book, and I do n't choose him.  But I forget: I am no longer privileged to tease
    you.--Ever,

    SUSANNA FLORENCE MARY BRIDEHEAD.


 MY DEAR SUE,--Of course I wish you joy And also of course
    I will give you away.  What I suggest, I think,
    since I am,.

    I do n't see? " she said suddenly.


---
She talked incessantly,. 
---
as if she dreaded his indulgence in
 reflection, and
---
By the irony of fate, and the
 curious trick in Sue's nature of tempting Providence at critical
 times, she took his arm.


---
as they walked through the muddy street-- a
 thing she had never done before in her life-- and on turning the
 corner they found themselves close to a grey perpendicular church
 with a low- pitched roof-- the church of St. Thomas
---
Indeed!" she exclaimed with curiosity. 
---
She does not realize
---
Sue still held Jude's arm,. 
---
almost as if she
 loved him
---
Cruelly sweet, indeed, she had been to him that morning;
 but...
---
" to do things like this," she said in the delicate voice of an
 epicure in emotions, which left no doubt that she spoke the truth.


---
I know!
---
she said regretfully. 
---
, as she blinked away an
 access of eye moisture
---
" And I promised!... 
---
I
 suppose. 
---
I ought
---
Oh, I
 ought n't! 
---
I see it now. 
---
I wo n't do it any more!"
---
she continued
 humbly; and
---
whose train had arrived sooner than Sue expected. 
---
she withdrew her
 hand, and
---
she, smiling candidly
---
she had gone too far.


---
which she accordingly
 did
---
" No," said Sue,".


---
I'll go on to the house with him"; and
---
requesting
 her lover not to be a long time she departed with the schoolmaster
---
Sue was obvious; and
---
she could almost be seen.


---
that she was

---
the couple were
 judged, nobody supposing
 Sue to have been a recent pupil at the training school.


---
," she said. 
---
" I'll take the bonnet
 off."


---
And she obeyed.


---
How could Sue have had the temerity?

---
Women were different from men in such matters. 
---
Or was Sue simply so perverse
 that she wilfully gave herself and him pain for the odd and mournful
 luxury of practising long- suffering in her own person, and of being
 touched with tender pity for him at having made him practise it? 
---
that her face was nervously set, and
---
as it seemed, from her knowledge of
 what her cousin must feel,
---
rather, however, whom she need not have had there at all,
 than from self- consideration. 
---
Possibly she would go on.


---
In crossing the pavement to the fly she looked back;
 and
---
there was a frightened light in her eyes. 
---
that Sue
 had acted with such unusual foolishness
---
as to plunge into she knew
 not what for the sake of asserting her independence of him, of
 retaliating on him for his secrecy? 
---
Perhaps Sue was thus venturesome
 with men.


---
because she was childishly ignorant of that side of their
 natures which wore out women's hearts and lives
---
When her foot was on the carriage- step
---
she turned round,. 
---
that
 she had forgotten something
---
" No," she said,. 
---
I know."


---
where
 I left it
---
She had found it, and. 
---
She looked into his eyes with her own tearful ones, and
---
her
 lips suddenly parted. 
---
as if she were going
---
But she
 went on; and.




---
whatever she had meant
---
if she had really left her handkerchief behind
---
that she had miserably wished
---
that at the last moment she could not bring herself
---
that she would come back
---
She could not
 possibly go home with Phillotson
---
Her
 actions were always unpredictable:? 
---
why should she not come
---
But she did not come.


---
whither she and Phillotson had gone for their holiday
---
looked out of
 the window, and pictured her through the evening journey to London,
; their rattling
 along through the damp night to their hotel, under the same sky of
 ribbed cloud through which the moon showed its
 position rather than its shape, and
---
It was a new
 beginning of Sue's history. 
---
see
 her child-- hers solely-- there would be comfort in it!
---
that his old
 aunt was dangerously ill at Marygreen, which intelligence
---
There was every possibility of her
 lingering on for weeks or months, though little likelihood. 
---
that
 she might like
---
she had occupied when
---
The chair, leaning over her ecclesiastical
 scrolls, a hog- hair brush in her hand, her girlish figure had

---
as if she were dead, and
---
nobody had been
 found capable of succeeding her in that artistic pursuit. 
---
when she turned her face for a moment to the glass
---
If she had come on to his compartment
---
she would have seen him.

---
But she did not, this being presided over by the maiden on the other
 side. 
---
Abby was in a black gown, with white linen cuffs and a broad
 white collar, and her figure, more developed than formerly,.

---
was
 accentuated by a bunch of daffodils that she wore on her left bosom
---
In the compartment she served
---
she cried gaily. "
---
She served the liqueur from one of the lovely bottles and.


---
Not a sound," said she.


---
" I left him in Australia; and
---
I suppose."


---
I'll romantically vanish up the
 street of this picturesque city
---
She handed the change over the counter, in taking. 
---
Arabella now seemed. 
---
that she served
---
Arabella did not recognize him for a moment. 
---
She started
---
; till a humorous impudence sparkled in her eyes, and she
 spoke.


---
" Well, I'm blest! 
---
I thought!"


---
" I never heard anything of you, or
---
I do n't know. 
---
that I should
 have come here
---
What shall I treat you to this
 afternoon? 
---
She idly allowed. 
---
her fingers to rest on the
 pull of the beer- engine
---
as she inspected him critically
---
that her hands were smaller and whiter than when he had lived with
 her, and
---
she wore an
 ornamental ring set with what seemed to be real sapphires-- which they
 were, indeed, and were much admired as such by the young men who
 frequented the bar.


---
" I do n't care to go into them," she replied evasively. 
---
" I make a
 very good living, and
---
I do n't know."


---
that I want your company
---
Arabella was
. 
---
"," she said,
. 
---
I can get off duty two hours sooner than usual,. 
---
if
 I ask
---
I am not living in the house at present."


---
I'll come back
---
I suppose."


---
I'm not going!"


---
But I must know a thing or two; and,
---
Very well; I'll call for you."


---
Though Arabella's word was absolutely
 untrustworthy
---
there might be some truth in her
 implication
---
that she had not wished, and
---
Having to meet Arabella here, it was impossible. 
---
Arabella was perhaps an intended intervention to punish him for his
 unauthorized love. 
---
each having a pink
 flush on her cheek
---
that she would find him outside the door
---
when she came away
---
," she said with great
 good humour. 
---
: I always do
---
She drew a couple of liqueur glasses of brandy; and

---
though she had evidently, from her countenance, already taken in
 enough alcohol either by drinking or,
---
more probably, from the
 atmosphere she had breathed for so many hours
---
, she finished hers
 quickly. 
---
In a few minutes she came, in a thick jacket and a hat with a black
 feather. 
---
I live quite near
---
"," she said," and. 
---
" Oh-- none in particular," he answered,; the probable disappointment of Sue that he was not there when
 she arrived, and the missed pleasure of her company on the long and
 lonely climb by starlight up the hills to Marygreen. 
---
My aunt is on her deathbed
---
There was something particularly uncongenial in the idea of Arabella,
. 
---
She speedily returned, and
---
Having, like Jude, made rather a
 hasty toilet to catch the train, Arabella looked a little frowsy,
 and
---
her face was very far from possessing the animation which had
 characterized it at the bar the night before. 
---
she found. 
---
that she still had half an hour to spare
---
before
 she was due at the bar
---
What?" said she.


---
" Well I think
---
as I have
. 
---
" So I had-- two things-- one in particular.  I'll tell you now?  As an honest
 woman I wish...  It was-- about that gentleman who managed the Sydney hotel."

---
Arabella spoke somewhat hurriedly for her. 
---
her disappear in the direction of
 the hotel
---
as she lay asleep at dawn,
 which set upon his motionless face a look as of one accurst
---
To his great surprise no other than Sue stood
 like a vision before him--.


---
her strained eyes speaking reproachful
 inquiry
---
" she said in quick,
 uneven accents not far from a sob. 
---
Then she flushed.


---
as she observed
 his thought that they had not met since her marriage
---
till she glanced at him with furtive solicitude
---
" I arrived at
 Alfredston station last night,, and
---
Aunt was a trifle better
---
" I thought I would come by the morning train and" I did think of my promise to you, dear, continually!  I shall never
 break out again as I did, I am sure.  I may have been doing nothing
 better, but I was not doing that-- I loathe the thought of it."

" I am glad your staying had nothing to do with that.  But," she said,
,!"


---
I didn't
---
"-- I am sorry to say. 
---
I had an appointment at nine
 o'clock-- too late for me to catch the train that would have met
 yours, or to get home at all."


---
as she appeared to him now, in his tender

---
that her spirit could be seen
---
And yet she was Phillotson's. 
---
How she had

---
such, how she lived as such,
---
how my aunt is by this time
---
Though she knew
---
she did not turn
 to him, but.

"
---
"," she quickly returned.


---
But I wish"

" Jude-- don't talk about ME-- I wish!" she entreated.

---
She had asked the question in perfect innocence,.

---
That Sue was not, but. 
---
as she had been
---
Yet she seemed unaltered
---
Sue talked; but
---
that she still kept the conversation
 from herself
---
" O yes," she said. 
---
-- only I would n't let him. 
---
I felt. 
---
Aunt Drusilla, I knew,.

---
that she is hardly conscious
---
I am glad."


---
I did
---
that she was unhappy
---
although she had not been
---
whom she had hardly known in her life
---
She reproached him by a glance.


---
Sue put on a look of being offended,, so far as I can see!"


---
till she answered," Nor has
 husbandom you
---
That's the house my wife and

---
She looked at it. "
---
She closed her lips in retortive silence, and
---
till she glanced at him
---
that, from some cause or other, in
 taking Phillotson as a husband, Sue felt
---
that she had done
---
what she
 ought
---
who
 at sight of them lifted her hands deprecatingly
---
" She's downstairs,
!"
---
she got, and

---
" Out o' bed nothing could turn her. 
---
On entering, there indeed by the fireplace sat the old woman, wrapped
 in blankets, and. 
---
for she
 said in a hollow voice:

"
---
ye, have I
---
I was n't going! '
---
she added,. 
---
as I did
---
most women marry, Aunt
---
" I do n't meant."


---
" I can mind the man very well. 
---
Sue jumped up and. 
---
" She means well, but."


---
said Sue,. 
---
" I do n't
 mind her roughness one bit."


---
what she says
---
" I do n't mean that!"
---
she said hastily. 
---
" That I ought
---
-- perhaps I
 ought!"


---
if she had really been going
---
her aunt took
 rather kindly to Sue,.

---
not many young women newly
 married
---
In the afternoon Sue prepared
---
" I'll go with you to the station,?"
---
She would not let him. 
---
for she
 looked at him prohibitively
---
She bent down and.

---
She waved her hand and.


---
" She's right! 
---
there arrived a letter
 from Arabella. 
---
Arabella informed him. 
---
that a few days after their
 parting in the morning at Christminster, she had been surprised by an
 affectionate letter from her Australian husband, formerly manager of
 the hotel in Sydney
---
her to join him in conducting the business, which was likely
 to be a very thriving one, the house being situated in an excellent,
 densely populated, gin- drinking neighbourhood, and
---
where she was
---
implored her to
 tell him, as her engagement in Christminster was only temporary, she had

---
She could not help,.

---
that
 she belonged to him more than to Jude
---
since she had properly married
 him, and
---
good- bye she bore him no ill- will, and.




---
that she had a chance of improving her
 circumstances and leading a genteel life
---
that, in the laconic words of the
 historian," insulted Nature sometimes vindicated her rights" in such
 circumstances
---
even though she had not told him of her
 Sydney husband till afterwards
---
that she despised herself for having
 and
---
that she liked

---
as her manner was
---
, Sue,,
 delayed her reply till Thursday before Good Friday,. 
---
when she said
---
for she was now assistant- teacher in
 her husband's school
---
where there were more wanton
 women than honest wives and maids
---
girls in white
 pinafores over red and blue frocks appeared. 
---
that Sue had gone out into the town at the
 heels of the last scholar
---
the girl sweeping the floor having informed him
---
it was still the girl with
 the broom
---
" Do n't stop," said Sue. 
---
" I like it. 
---
I learnt it. 
---
before I left
 Melchester
---
" I ca n't strum before you! 
---
" Oh well-- I do n't mind."


---
Sue sat down, and
---
She, like him, was evidently
; and, and
---
when she
 had finished
---
"," she said, in a voice"
---
that I should care
 about that air; because--"

" Because what?
---
"

" I am not that sort-- quite."


---
" I did n't quite mean that."


---
"

 She played on and suddenly.


---
She uttered a forced little laugh.

---
as she relinquished his quickly
---
" How funny!" she said. 
---
" I wonder?"


---
" I suppose."


---

---
to visit not to live in-- I feel.

I'll tell Ada.

she flung open
 before going out, and
---
when she returned,

the door of which followed by the maiden with
 tea

---
if she talked of
 him to Phillotson

," she went on.

---
which she read clearly
---
as she always did
---
She regarded him curiously.


---
"!" she coaxed. 
---
The
_ tremolo_ in her voice caused.


---
her to break off
---
till she suddenly jumped up; and
---
"" she said,. 
---
I
 am very much the reverse of what you say so cruelly
---
Yet I ca n't tell you the truth--! 
---
I should shock
 you by letting you know how I give way to my impulses, and
---
how much I
 feel
---
that I should n't have been provided with attractiveness
---
Some women's love of being loved is
 insatiable;
---
I am sorry
---
" I perceive
---
, she touched
 his fingers but lightly when he went out now. 
---
when, with a dissatisfied look, she jumped on a form
 and
---
" to catch your train,
 Jude?" she asked.


---
" Oh-- wander about, I suppose. 
---
Perhaps I shall go and."


---
I can talk to you better like this than when you
 were inside... 
---
Now, she seemed.


---
she had

---
" I have been thinking,. 
---
" she continued, still in the tone of one
 brimful of feeling,"
---
I
 am called Mrs. Richard Phillotson,. 
---
But I am not really Mrs. Richard
 Phillotson, but unaccountable antipathies... 
---
a woman tossed about, all alone, with aberrant
 passions, and
---
She stretched out her hand
 and. 
---
She had said.


---
she lived over the way at Old- Grove
 Place, a house which he soon discovered from her description of its
 antiquity
---
Sue,
 evidently just come in
---
, the latter being
 crossed by huge moulded beams only a little way above her head. 
---
The centuries did, indeed, ponderously
 overhang a young wife who passed her time here.


---
She had opened a rosewood work- box, and.

---
while she pressed it against her
 bosom, and
---
that she had not obscured the windows she came
 forward to do so, candle in hand
---
for her to see
 Jude without
---
She closed the shutters, and
---
Whose photograph was she looking at?
---
she had others
---
However,, woman did. 
---
she was wrong in her view
---
Your aunt is sinking
---
that she is dead,
---
" She would n't have knowed' ee. 
---
She lay like a doll wi' glass eyes
---
It was absolutely necessary to
 communicate with Sue, though. 
---
Aunt Drusilla is dead,
---
if Sue would come
---
She had not written, and
---
that she would come
---
than that she would not
---
she looked so slender to- day. 
---
as if she might be crushed in the intensity of a too passionate
 embrace--
---
Two- thirds of the way
 up her head suddenly took a solicitous poise, and
---
that she
 had at that moment
---
Her face soon began a pensive
 smile, which lasted till, having descended a little way
---
," she began with nervous quickness
---
With the elusiveness of her curious double nature, however, Sue did

---
But
 Sue either saw it not at all, or,.


---
herself to feel it
---
Drusilla was put
 into the new ground, quite away from her ancestors. 
---
Sue and Jude
 had gone side by side to the grave, and
---
She was opposed to marriage, from first to last
---
murmured
 Sue.


---
She said. 
---
At all events, I do, for one!"


---
Sue was silent. 
---
"," she said with a tentative
 tremor," for a husband or wife? 
---
Presently she went on
---
Would n't the woman, for example, be very
 bad- natured
---
if she did n't like
---
because she had a
 personal feeling against it-- a physical objection-- a fastidiousness,
 or whatever it may be called-- although she might respect and be
 grateful to him
---
she to try
---
she contradicted. 
---
How can a woman be unhappy
---
she chose freely
---
A little laugh of objection came from Sue. 
---
" Very well," she said dubiously. 
---
" I did n't tell him."


---
I would come for
 certain
---
her know
---
Her hand lay on the table, and
---
Sue drew hers
 away.


---
"," she said repentantly. 
---
Only I have

---
" But I must tell him."


---
I have no feelings of love left in me."


---
" I've seen Arabella."


---
She winced at the hit
---
When did you see her
---
" When I was at Christminster."


---
" So she's come back; and
---
I suppose?"


---
you will live
 with her now
---
She looked at the window pots with the geraniums and cactuses,
. 
---
through them at the outer
 distance, till her eyes began
---
" Why should you be so glad to go back to her! 
---
How could your heart go back to Arabella so soon?"


---
she said with gentle resentment. 
---
I am not happy
---
" I do n't know. 
---
I do n't wish."


---
If I were unhappy
---
"; not that
 I should have a right to dislike him! 
---
as I am than
 he
---
she had
---
which she did in a vanquished tone
---
I-- I think. 
---
I must be equally honest with you
---
I want
---
though I
 like Mr. Phillotson as a friend, I do n't like him
---
I have let it out--,--!" 
---
I
 could n't help it
---
although I have been
---
I am happy.--Now
 you'll have a contempt for me for ever
---
, I suppose
---
She bent down
 her face upon her hands.


---
" I have only been married a month or two!"
---
she went on,. 
---
what a woman shrinks from-- in the early days of her
 marriage
---
that-- she shakes down to with comfortable indifference in half a
 dozen years
---
You would have been my
 wife, Sue,
---
Instead of replying she rose quickly, and. 
---
she was going
---
her cross the village green towards Mrs. Edlin's
---
soon she
 sent a little girl, and.


---
she was too tired
 to see him again that night
---
that Sue was sitting within its walls equally lonely and
 disheartened; and
---
a woman looking out of the open
 casement at a window on the ground floor of the adjacent cottage
---
said a voice timidly-- Sue's voice. 
---
so that she
 was visible down to her waist
---
She let.

"
---
that a married woman in trouble of a kind like mine commits a mortal
 sin in making a man the confidant of it, as I did you
---
it happens to lots of
 women
---
In a moment of impulse she bent over the sill, and. 
---
She shut the casement, and
---
when it was time for her to go
---
her companion and herself disappearing on foot down the hill path
 which led into the lonely road to Alfredston
---
she said tearfully. 
---
Then she had conceded. 
---
If given
 in the spirit of a cousin and a friend she saw no objection. 
---
: if in
 the spirit of a lover she could not permit it
---
" she had said.


---
What Sue
 had said in warmth
---
that the women are; or
---
her give way to an impulse,
 if not wrongly
---
She was inclined to call it the latter
---
" she jerked out. 
---
as she pranced on
---
Then the slim little wife of a husband whose person was disagreeable
 to her
---
brought weariness into her eyes by
 gazing and worrying hopelessly
---
that she was

---
it must be owing to the depressing effect of her
 aunt's death and funeral
---
While ascending to the
 town, seated on the top of the omnibus beside him, she said suddenly
 and with an air of self- chastisement,:

". 
---
Richard-- I let
---
I do n't know
?"


---
that Sue had placed the minor for the major indiscretion, and
---
She remained in an unusually silent, tense, and restless condition,
 and at last,,. 
---
she was tired
---
Sue was dozing
---
The heavy, gloomy oak wainscot,," and the
 massive chimney- piece reaching to the ceiling, stood in odd contrast
 to the new and shining brass bedstead, and the new suite of birch
 furniture that he had bought for her, the two styles seeming to nod
 to each other across three centuries upon the shaking floor.


---
( this being the way in which he pronounced her name)
---
She was not in the bed,
---
though she had apparently been there--
---
the
 clothes on her side being flung back. 
---
she might have
 forgotten some kitchen detail and
---
when, finding she did not come
---
She was not there,
 even now. 
---
She answered" Yes!" as before, but
---
if she
 had suddenly become deranged
---
She had
 fastened it inside with a piece of string, which broke at his pull.

---
she had flung down some rugs and
---
she sprang out of her lair, great- eyed and
 trembling.


---
" she cried excitedly.

---
She looked so pitiful and pleading in her white nightgown against the
 shadowy lumber- hole. 
---
She continued.


---
she, weeping
---
Eliza will hear."

---
Sue had already gone downstairs. 
---
There was a little nest where she
 had lain, and spiders' webs hung overhead. 
---
" What must a woman's
 aversion be!"
---
when it is stronger than her fear of spiders
---
her sitting at the breakfast- table, and
---
as so many women are--
---
" I am bound in honesty to tell you that I weighed its probability and
 inquired of your cousin about it."

" Ah!" she said with pained surprise.


---
" I did n't doubt you."


---
" I took his word."


---
Her eyes had filled. 
---
" she said.

---
," she burst out,
""


---
But I meant."

 As I choose."

 Sue continued:.' 
---
" She, or he,' or his own portion
 of it, choose his plan of life for him,
---
as she, in her loss of
 courage at the last moment, meant
---
She was beginning.


---
his wife turn and
---
as she read it
---
, her lips slightly crisped,
---
she changed her position, and
---
She wrote again
---
No poor woman
    has ever wished
---
At first,, she had seemed
; but
---
the irksomeness of
 their position worked on her temperament, and
---
the fibres of her
 nature seemed. 
---
She talked vaguely and
.




---
her
 flinging up the sash
---
that she meant
---
she had mounted upon the sill and
---
She
 disappeared in the darkness, and
---
her fall below
---
bringing Sue into the hall seated her on a chair, where he
 gazed at her by the flapping light of the candle which he had set
 down in the draught on the bottom stair
---
She had certainly not broken her neck. 
---
She looked at him with eyes

---
She pressed her side and
---
Her fall, in fact, had not been a serious one,.

---
Beyond a scraped elbow and a blow in the side she had
---
She wrote again:


    I know.  I beg
    you to; I implore you!  I would not ask if I
    were not!  more than I that Eve had not fallen, so that
   ( as the primitive Christians believed) But I wo n't trifle!
    even though I have not been kind to you!  I
    will go away,.


 I do not wish How well you KNOW I do n't! I am disposed to agree to your last request.


 I do not deserve your
    kindness.


 Though it's not for want of
 trying-- not much hurt I hope?"

" I was asleep, I think!" she began
---
she was silent.


---
Her cloak was hanging at the back of the door, and
---
The aspect of things was not improved by her admission. 
---
She ascended
 the staircase slowly, the waving light of the candle shining on her.

---
her enter her room
---
that she is not so much to blame as I.
---
She
 was a pupil- teacher under me,, and
---
her to agree
 to a long engagement before she well knew her own mind
---
Afterwards
 she saw somebody else, but
---
she blindly fulfilled her engagement."


---
She is one of the oddest creatures I ever met. 
---
even
 though she may like me as a friend,
---
She has conscientiously struggled against it, but to no purpose.

---
-- she has

---
as I.  Her intellect sparkles like diamonds
---
She's one too many for me!"


---
" She'll get over it, good- now?"


---
there are reasons why she
 never will. 
---
At last she calmly and firmly asked. 
---
if she might leave
 me and
---
my
 entering her room by accident
---
when, owing to, she jumped out of window--
---
She pretended, but
---
when a woman jumps out of window without caring
 whether she breaks her neck or no
---
Now, she's not; and
---
I have come to a conclusion: that it is wrong to so
 torture a fellow- creature any longer; and I wo n't be the inhuman
 wretch to do it, cost what it may!"


---
her go
---
" Whom with is her matter. 
---
I shall let
---
her go
---
; with him certainly,
 if she wishes. 
---
I know
---
I may be wrong
---
-- I know. 
---
I ca n't logically,
 or religiously, defend my concession to such a wish of hers, or

---
I was brought up in
---
Only I know one
 thing: something within me tells me. 
---
I am doing wrong in refusing
 her
---
I, like other men, profess. 
---
I do n't profess
. 
---
I simply am going, and
---
If a person, I am inclined to give it, if possible."


---
Oh, I am not going! 
---
I only see
."


---
" Well-- I do n't agree with your instinct, Dick!"
---
that she was puzzling and peculiar
---
when I called:
 I think" Have you ever stood before a woman,--?"


---
while she has pleaded for release
---
she has

---
she kept to herself
---
, she would rather endure her
 present misery than
---
that is a question for herself
---
However, she has not distinctly implied,...  And,
---
she means to
---
why the woman and the children should not be the unit without the
 man
---
" Yes-- I am all abroad, I suppose!"...  Does SHE say all this too?"


---
She little thinks
---
that she's a charming young thing
---
she ought,
---
" to be smacked brought to her senses-- that's
!"
---
as she glided into the parlour to tea
---
Her nervous
 manner, begotten of a fear lest he should be injured by her course
---
She took the slice
---
" So that being without a wife will
 not really be irksome to me,. 
---
"!" she said with
 amenable gentleness. 
---
" I should much like-- as a-- f- f- friend."


---
" No, I think,
---
And for this reason, that I do n't
 wish, and... 
---
" Oh, of course, Richard, I could n't think of having any of your money
 to go away from you with! 
---
I do n't want any either. 
---
I have enough of
 my own to last me for a long while, and
---
" I would rather not know anything about him,
---
But I'll just say. 
---
that I have packed only a change or
 two of my own personal clothing, and one or two little things besides

---
I wish. 
---
Besides that I have only a small parcel that will go into
 Jude's portmanteau."


---
" Of course I shall do no such thing! 
---
I wish
. 
---
I do n't
 want. 
---
I have a sort of affection for a little
 of it that belonged to my poor mother and father. 
---
" That I shall never do."


---
I am going, Richard
---
" I like you much for how you have behaved. 
---
as
 my old teacher, I like you. 
---
I wo n't be so affected. 
---
I love
 you,
---
because I do n't, except as a friend
---
Sue was for a few moments a little tearful at these reflections, and

---
that she was going for
 a short visit
---
I could make
---
I walked in, and

---
She is quite well. 
---
She is gone--. 
---
That's her tea- cup,
. 
---
that she drank out of only an hour ago
---
she is
---
She is,,. 
---
I would have died for her; but I would n't be cruel to her
 in the name of the law.  as I understand What they are going to do I can not say.  she has my full consent to."


---
that she had left behind
---
She
 would n't take all I wanted her to
---
" To adorn her in somebody's eyes; never again in
 mine!"



 V


 Four- and- twenty hours before this time Sue had written the following
 note to Jude:


    and
---
As she was carried by the omnibus farther and farther down from
 the mountain town-- the single passenger that evening-- she regarded
 the receding road with a sad face. 
---
by which she was departing stopped by signal only. 
---
To
 Sue it seemed strange.


---
that such a powerful organization as a railway
 train should be brought to a stand- still on purpose for her-- a
 fugitive from her lawful home
---
Sue began
. 
---
she beheld Jude. 
---
She clasped his hand with both hers, and
---
her tense state
 caused. 
---
her to simmer over in a little succession of dry sobs
---
"," she repeated.


---
she,
 taking up in her voice the emotion that had begun in his
---
But she
 recovered her equanimity by the time.


---
"," she resumed. 
---
she answered. 
---
" But I am so cold, or devoid of gratitude, or
 so something, that even this generosity hasn't made me love him, or
 repent, or want to stay with him as his wife
---
; although I do feel I
 like his large- mindedness, and respect him more than ever."


---
" That I NEVER would have done
---
" Arabella
 has actually written
---
to ask me to get a divorce from her-- in kindness
 to her, she says. 
---
She wants; and
---
she has already married virtually
---
Perhaps she's no worse than I am, after all!

---
If she wants
---
" she asked, with the discontinuity that
 marked her to- night.

"
---
I thought of that, and I wired for a room for us at the
 Temperance Hotel there."

" One?"

" Yes-- one."

 She looked at him. 
---
Sue bent her forehead against the
 corner of the compartment. 
---
she put her
 face against his cheek,
---
""
 she said,.


---
I am something more than a mere-- selfish fellow
---
, I hope. 
---
, I hate convention
---
Much as, under your teaching, I hope!"


---
Even at this obvious moment for candour Sue could not be quite candid
 as to the state of that mystery, her heart. 
---
" Put it down to my
 timidity," she said with hurried evasiveness;" to a woman's natural
 timidity. 
---
I may feel. 
---
I may hold the opinion. 
---
, on whom nobody will have any
 right to question her
---
that I am now free
---
But, I would rather not be other than a
 little rigid. 
---
I may have acted
 otherwise. 
---
that
 I haven't the courage of my opinions
---
I know. 
---
I am a poor miserable
 creature
---
" I thought--. 
---
what I naturally thought
---
, I am sure
---
she had

---
I make only one condition--
---
that you are tender and kind to her
---
I
 know. 
---
you love her
---
You were all along' the shadowy third' in my short life with
 her. 
---
I repeat,."


---
she said with latent tears. 
---
On
 reconsideration she added,"! 
---
I never was so near being in love with him
 as when he made such thoughtful arrangements for my being comfortable
 on my journey, and offering to provide money. 
---
Yet I was not. 
---
If I
 loved him ever so little as a wife
---
, I'd go back to him even now."


---
"!" she said, and. 
---
as she could
---
She
 added in hurt tones, without turning round:". 
---
My liking for you is
 not as some women's perhaps
---
I do n't want! 
---
I quite realized. 
---
But, as me with you, I resolved. 
---
" I've let, and
---
whom she had handled thus
---
I wo n't let you!"
---
she coaxed,. 
---
I
 did n't dislike you to
---
, I own it, Jude. 
---
Only I do n't want
---
when she pleaded
---
( as she well knew
---
till she aroused herself at
 some thought
---
" I ca n't possibly go to that Temperance Inn, after your telegraphing
 that message!"


---
I have

---
But I haven't the courage of my views,. 
---
sometimes a woman's LOVE OF BEING LOVED
---
But gets the better of her
 conscience, and
---
though she is agonized at the thought of treating a
 man cruelly
---
, she encourages him. 
---
while she does n't love
 him at all
---
when she sees
---
Then,, her remorse sets in,
 and
---
as I said
 before I did n't marry him altogether because of the scandal.
 she does."


---
what she can
---
that she was distressed and tearful at his criticisms,
 and
---
I am very bad and unprincipled-- I know!" she said,
.


---
" I think and"


---
you are my dear Sue, from whom neither length nor
 breadth, nor things present nor things to come
---
Though so sophisticated in many things, she was such a child in others
. 
---
that this satisfied her, and
---
As she would not go
 to the Temperance Hotel because of the form of his telegram
---
During Jude's temporary absence the waiting- maid spoke to Sue.


---
I think,
---
" ma'am, I remember."


---
"" said Sue, with a certain sickness of heart. 
---
" Though I
 think! 
---
" You were lately here with Arabella. 
---
you had met her
---
" The day before I met you in Christminster,.  I told you I had met her."

 Your
 story was."


---
not that you had made it up with
 her
---
She was so mortified that he was
 obliged to take her into her room and close the door lest the people
 should hear. 
---
" But Sue, she was, after all, my legal wife,.


---
if not--"

 Slipping down on her knees
---
Sue buried her face in the bed and
---
" But you must have thought much of her! 
---
women never do! 
---
she pouted provokingly
---
that she had never been really your wife
---
since
 she left you of her own accord years and years ago
---
She has married another man--! 
---
And it is evidently a prick of conscience in her that has led
 her to urge me to get a divorce,. 
---
that she may remarry this man
 legally
---
when you saw her
---
Sue more gently, as she rose
---
" she solicited,. 
---
She put the tip of her finger gingerly to her cheek; and
---
-- they were glad to have her settle among them
---
For some time after her flight from that home Sue's absence did not
 excite comment. 
---
Her place as monitor in the school was taken by
 another young woman within a few days of her vacating it
---
Sue's services having been
 of a provisional nature only. 
---
that Sue had played
 him false and
---
when misapprehensions as to Sue's conduct spread abroad
---
that your wife's going
 away
---
" She has gone?"


---
" She has gone away under circumstances that usually call for
 condolence with the husband. 
---
She asked
, and
---
I let her. 
---
should n't I? 
---
A
 woman of full age, it was a question of her own conscience-- not for
 me. 
---
I was not her gaoler. 
---
I ca n't explain any further. 
---
I do n't
 wish."


---
who was a schoolgirl just out of her standards
---
what money she required
---
She does n't care anything about me!
---
should
 she?
---
" Why"

" She does n't know."


---
she living?"


---
its reaching her
---
there
 entered-- Sue.


---
She was in light spring clothing, and
---
her advent seemed ghostly-- like
 the flitting in of a moth. 
---
"," she said,. 
---
" But I heard; and-- and
---
as I know
---
, I have come."


---
" I am not very ill, my dear friend. 
---
" I did n't know that; and
---
I am afraid that only a severe illness would
 have justified my coming!"


---
And I almost wish! 
---
, I suppose
---
Only that I am going away from here to another place. 
---
I do n't agree, and
---
Sue did not for a moment, either now or later, suspect; it never once seemed, and.

---
she had received no news whatever from Shaston
---
as she descended the stairs she lifted her
 eyes and hands in grotesque amazement
---
Sue went
 to the window and."


---
But I lose them all,."


---
But I ca n't.
---
"

" I'll help you to."


---
how I mean
---
She went to where a swing- glass stood, and taking it in her hands
 carried it to a spot by the window where it could catch the sunshine,
 moving the glass.

"
---
!" she said. 
---
" And I am
 sure it will cheer you
---
-- I do so hope!" 
---
She spoke with a
 childlike, repentant kindness,.


---
as if she could not do too much for
 him
---
she said quickly. 
---
" I have
---
I have come
---
when I started
---
so I must return home almost directly. 
---
Richard,
 I am so very glad you are better. 
---
I am glad to know you think so
---
she put
 her hand in
---
; for she was
 significantly light in touch. 
---
She had nearly closed the door!" 
---
She came back.

"
---
Sue" do you wish, and? 
---
" Oh!" she said hastily. 
---
It is altogether news to me that he has a wife."


---
She wrote and. 
---
it would be a kindness to her,
---
since
 then she could marry and
---
But I do n't like the sound of it. 
---
I can forgive,
 Sue."


---
I have been so wicked--!"


---
what I have done
---
" I MUST go
 now. 
---
I'll come again--"


---
may I?
---
" I do n't ask you, even now. 
---
I ask you."


---
" I thank you, Richard; but. 
---
I must
---
, I CANNOT stay!"


---
She's his-- his from lips to heel!"
---
so faintly
 that in closing the door she did not hear it
---
her telling him

She's been here

She just came,."


---
If she were
 not your wife--"


---
She is not

"; she's another man's except in name and law. 
---
-- it was suggested to me by a conversation I had with
 her--
---
, now she has
 been back, and. 
---
What's the use of keeping
 her chained on to me if she does n't belong to me? 
---
that she would welcome to her
---
she
 sympathizes with
---
as a fellow- creature, and pities me, and even weeps for me, as a husband
 she can not endure me
---
though-- she loathes me
---
-- she loathes me, and my only manly, and dignified, and merciful

---
for her to be independent
---
though she does not know it
---
her go
---
my liberating her
---
that can do her no possible harm, and
---
which she has never dreamt of hitherto
---
after I said I had forgiven
 her I believe,
 though I did not see it at the moment.  I know-- I feel
 absolutely certain--.  what I have begun I have; I see only dire poverty ahead from
 my feet to the grave; for I can be accepted as teacher no more.  I
 shall probably have enough to do to make both ends meet during the
 remainder of my life, now my occupation's gone; and I shall be
 better able to bear it alone.  I may as well tell you."

" Well-- I do n't want your opinion on that.  What I was going For then they'll be able to marry,."


---
Sue and Jude were living in Aldbrickham, in precisely the same
 relations that they had established between themselves when she
 left Shaston to join him the year before. 
---
Sue kept
 house, and.


---
Sue held up a letter she had just
 received.

"
---
her criminal second marriage would have

---
she punished;
---
nobody took any interest in
 her--. 
---
By degrees Sue acquired her lover's cheerfulness at the sense of
 freedom, and.

---
Sue went up- stairs and.


---
we can," said Sue, without enthusiasm
---
It
 is so much sweeter-- for the woman at least, and. 
---
when she is sure of
 the man
---
"

" Well," she sighed,". 
---
Fewer women like marriage, only they enter into it
 for the dignity."


---
that women are taught by other women
---
Not being men,
 these women do n't know. 
---
who
 was the soul of truth in her conduct
---
A Nemesis attends the woman who plays the game of
 elusiveness too often, in the utter contempt for her."


---
that, sooner
 or later, her old admirers feel;
---
her to go
 unlamented to her grave
---
Sue,, had acquired a guilty look; and

---
she suddenly replied in a tragic voice:!"


---
" I do n't think
---
I like you
 to- day so well as I did, Jude
---
Though I suppose!"


---
I am so
 bad and worthless that I deserve the utmost rigour of lecturing
---
when I want
---
" Oh yes, I am bad, and obstinate, and all sorts! 
---
I am not
---
as I
 do
---
that I have nobody but
---
that I must n't have my own way in deciding how I'll
 live with you, and
---
whether I'll be married or no
---
" Sue, my own comrade and sweetheart, I do n't want! 
---
I do n't
---
Sue was assisting Jude very
 materially now
---
, Sue,, laid out supper for him. 
---
Contrary to custom she did not
 speak. 
---
that her face was troubled
---
She paused a moment. 
---
"," she answered.


---
Sue's voice quavered, and
---
as she spoke
---
she suddenly
 sat down from her preparations,. 
---
I do n't know!
---
whether I did right or not
---
"" she
 continued. 
---
when she said
---
she would
 wait
---
you might not be able to see her
---
she wanted a headstone
---
" I said, I said I thought."

 I suppose.  Was
 she in mourning?"


---
" No. She was n't in mourning, and
---
she did n't want a headstone; and
---
you could n't see her
---
Sue looked critically and imploringly
 at him.

"
---
But who was she? 
---
I
 thought."  Did n't she say?"


---
She would n't give her name. 
---
who she was--
---
But I know I think I
 do!  It was Arabella!"


---
What should Arabella come for? 
---
it was she
---
" Oh, I can hardly tell.  But I know!  I feel perfectly certain
 it was-- by the light in her eyes as she looked at me.  She was a
 fleshy, coarse woman."


---
though she may be getting so by this time under the duties of
 the public house
---
Well-- I should not have called Arabella coarse exactly, except in
 speech,.  She was rather handsome."


---
when I knew her But yes!--so she is!"


---
as she is nothing to me, and
---
" I think I heard a quiver in your little mouth.  Well, waiving that,
 virtuously married to another man, why
 should she come?"


---
" Are you sure she's married? 
---
why she asked me
---
She and the man both wanted,."

"
---
as I
 understood
---
, it WAS Arabella
---
" cried Sue,. 
---
" And I am so miserable! 
---
It seems such an ill omen,
 whatever she may have come for. 
---
You could not possibly see her
---
" I do n't really think. 
---
I could
---
It would be so very painful to talk
 to her now-- for her as much as for me. 
---
However, she's gone. 
---
she would come again
---
But she went away very reluctantly."


---
Sue instantly emerged from her room,
 but.


---
which she had
---
" There she is again!" 
---
Sue whispered in appalled accents.


---
" She knocked like that last time."


---
I'll open a window
---
which was
 unmistakably Arabella's
---
" Is it she?
---
"," said Arabella humbly.

---
But I called earlier--
---
I wanted. 
---
if
 I could
---
I am in trouble, and!"


---
Arabella hesitated. 
---
"," she returned. 
---
Sue remained at gaze, in painful tension,, but
 speaking none.


---
She was about to give the address, but
---
she
 said,". 
---
I am afraid somebody may hear,
---
so I do n't like
---
where I am staying
 to- night
---
walk
 a little way with me towards the Prince Inn,, I would explain all. 
---
I must do her the kindness of hearing what's the
 matter
---
, I suppose
---
As she's going
 back to- morrow
---
as she did before
---
She is
 such a low- passioned woman
---
But she's not your wife!"
---
" Oh, but are you going to her? 
---
, now she's not your wife any
 more than I!"


---
Well, she is, rather more than you
---
she is so anxious to tell me
---
She said no more, but,. 
---
With a woman's disregard of her dignity when in the
 presence of nobody but herself, she also trotted down,. 
---
as she went
---
She listened. 
---
She knew. 
---
exactly how far
 it was to the inn that Arabella had named as her lodging
---
She looked at the clock. 
---
; she might get; and
---
In a still suspense she waited on. 
---
Sue gave a little ecstatic cry. 
---
" Oh, I knew.


---
I could trust
---
I ca n't find her anywhere in this street, and
---
I went out in my
 slippers only. 
---
She has walked on,. 
---
I've been so hard- hearted
 as to refuse her requests entirely, poor woman
---
I've come back for
 my boots,."


---
" Oh, but why should you take such trouble for a woman who has served
 you so badly!"
---
said Sue in a jealous burst of disappointment.


---
" But, Sue, she's a woman, and
---
I once cared for her; and."


---
She is n't your wife any longer!"
---
" exclaimed Sue, passionately
 excited. 
---
You
 CAN'T join her
---
, now she's a stranger to you. 
---
" She seems much the same as ever-- an erring, careless, unreflecting
 fellow- creature. 
---
" makes no
 difference in my real relations to her. 
---
If she was my wife
---
while
 she was away in Australia with another husband
---
, she's my wife now."


---
" But she was n't! 
---
She is too low, too coarse
---
It is all very well, and
 the wickedness of coercing a woman. 
---
" Well-- Arabella has appealed to me for help. 
---
" she said,
. 
---
" I have
 nobody but you, Jude, and
---
I did n't know
---
I ca n't bear it
---
, I ca n't! 
---
If she were yours
---
if I must
---
Very well then-- I must. 
---
so, I
 agree! 
---
I will be. 
---
Only I did n't mean to! 
---
And I did n't want!... 
---
But, yes-- I agree
---
, I agree! 
---
I do love you.

---
I ought!"


---
She ran across and. 
---
" I am not a
 cold- natured, sexless creature
---
, am I, for keeping you at such a
 distance? 
---
I am sure you do n't think so! 
---
I do belong
 to you,
---
do n't I? 
---
I give in!"


---
" And I'll arrange for our marriage to- morrow, or as soon as ever you
 wish."


---
" Then I'll let
---
her go
---
" I do feel
.

---
that it would be unfair to you perhaps unfair to her
---
She is not like you, my darling, and
---
I mean, or
---
Sue absently agreed. 
---
But her mind for the moment was
. 
---
A glow had passed away from her, and

---
depression sat upon her features.


---
I feel!
---
I was wickedly selfish last night
---
"" she murmured. 
---
as I did
---
I
 did n't care about her being in trouble, and what she wished to tell
 you! 
---
Perhaps it was really something she was justified in telling
 you. 
---
, I suppose! 
---
I wonder? 
---
how she got on
---
I hope."


---
she reached the
 inn all right, poor woman
---
" Oh yes: she got on all right
---
she was n't shut out, and
---
that she had
---
if she got in
---
You haven't the least idea how Arabella is
 able to shift for herself. 
---
There was no limit to the strange and unnecessary penances which Sue
 would meekly undertake when in a contrite mood; and
---
whose relation to her was
 precisely of a kind that would have made.

"
---
them was
 her instinct ever
---
Sue agreed, and. 
---
she had never done
 before
---
"!" she said, a sadness showing in her smile.


---
She walked along the muddy street. 
---
till she reached the public house
 mentioned by Arabella, which was not so very far off
---
She was

---
that Arabella had not yet left, and
---
in doubt how to announce
 herself, she sent up word that a friend from Spring Street had called,
 naming the place of Jude's residence
---
She was asked and. 
---
that it was Arabella's
 bedroom, and
---
She halted on the
 turn of her toe".


---
till Arabella cried from the bed,"
---
which Sue accordingly did
---
Arabella lay, and. 
---
Sue was wicked enough, despite her penitence,
---
She may have seemed handsome enough in profile under
 the lamps, but
---
the sight
 of her own fresh charms in the looking- glass made Sue's manner
 bright,.


---
till she reflected, and
---
what a meanly sexual emotion this was in
 her
---
" I've just looked in
---
to see," she said gently. 
---
" I was afraid afterwards?"


---
I thought.
---
Fawley, as I suppose?
---
" said Arabella,
 flinging her head back upon the pillows with a disappointed toss, and
.


---
she had just taken the trouble to
 produce
---
" Indeed I do n't," said Sue.

" Oh, I thought.
 Decency is decency, any hour of the twenty- four."


---
" I do n't know," said Sue stiffly. 
---
Sue looked out at the rain, and at the dirty toilet- cover, and at the
 detached tail of Arabella's hair hanging on the looking- glass,; and. 
---
she had not come
---
Arabella opened it.


---
as she lay, and
---
her ruffled look disappeared
---
" I am much obliged to you for your anxiety about me," she said
 blandly. 
---
when the maid had gone
---
She held
 out the telegram, but
---
for Sue to read
---
Sue did not take it. "
---
As for you, I should coax Jude, and
---
if I were in your
 place
---
I say it as a friend, my dear."


---
"," returned Sue, with frigid pride.


---
And
-- I say it friendly,
---
as woman to woman, for
 there's never
---
I shall marry my
 man over again
---
, I told him
---
I had almost made it up with Jude; and
---
, I expect! 
---
Perhaps I should quite have done it" and

," she said;
---
if
 a woman seems in trouble
---
as if I had made it up, and
---
just as
 well I forgive you
---
as I say
---
And,, I'd
 advise you.

---
"

" I have told you
---
to marry him-- to make our natural
 marriage a legal one," said Sue, with yet more dignity. 
---
I was free."


---
"," said Arabella,. 
---
"," said Sue hastily.


---
that the soft parts of her person shook
---
Sue jumped
 aside in trepidation. "
---
And I, too, must up and off!" replied the other,.  Lord, I am only a woman-- not a six- foot
 sojer!," she continued,
---
When Sue reached home

 Jude was awaiting her at the door. 
---
She clasped his arm, and
---
that she was preoccupied, and forbore to question her
---
" I really did want as I told him.  I came about that more than anything else.
 as I am going Well, I'll write to him about it.  I did n't want to write
 it, but never mind-- I will."



" Oh Jude-- I've been talking to her," she said at last. 
---
" I wish! 
---
I
 had n't
---
" I hope."


---
she was civil
---
I-- I ca n't help! 
---
She's not
 an ungenerous nature; and
---
I am so glad her difficulties have all
 suddenly ended." 
---
She explained. 
---
how Arabella had been summoned back,
 and
---
" I was referring
 to our old question. 
---
What Arabella has been saying to me
---
I wish!"


---
I had n't promised
---
I thought."


---
" Indeed, I do n't feel any more anxious now than I did before.

---
Perhaps with any other man I might be a little anxious; but
---
among the
 very few virtues, dear, I think. 
---
I
 may set staunchness
---
So I am not a bit frightened about losing you
---
,
 now I really am yours and
---
In fact, I am easier
 in my mind than I was, for my conscience
---
I felt."


---
whom I used
---
I almost expect
---
while Phryne made complaint that she was tired
 of posing
---
Sue stood back,
. 
---
while her lover went up to the door
---
when she said:" Jude
---
" Just let," she said timidly. 
---
" I had such a horrid dream
 one night!... 
---
And Arabella--"

" What did Arabella say to you
---
" Oh, she said
---
Her face brightened. 
---
" said she.

Sue taking his arm and

postponing thus a letter and a
 newspaper arrived before breakfast one morning from Arabella.

the handwriting Jude went up to Sue's room and and.

as she was dressed

as soon she hastened down

Sue opened the
 newspaper; Jude the letter.

 across the first page to him with her finger on a paragraph

" Look!" said she.

 faintly.

Sue watched him anxiously, with heavy
 breaths.

I ca n't make it out.

 she says

I can not think, and!... 
---
why she did n't tell me
---
when
 I met her at Christminster
---
Ah-- I do remember now."

that she said something about having
 a thing on her mind

that she would like me,

Sue replied, and

her
 eyes filled.

Sue jumped up and.

The woman opened the cover now and then,.

With her usual carelessness, she had

 for weeks of his approaching arrival
---
as she truly said,

---
This very day on which she had received her
 former husband's answer at some time in the afternoon
---
On his arrival at the Three Horns, Arabella had looked him over with
 an expression that was as good as saying," You are very much what I
 expected you to be
---
" I've got."


---
" No. I must walk."


---
" I am not afraid."


---
" I suppose."


---
I was coming

" Mother did n't wish."

Sue was about to
 enter her chamber adjoining.

when she heard and

She scrutinized the child's features, and. 
---
What Arabella says

But I ought to

yes, I ought!"


---
I withdraw all remarks about your sexlessness.

And Sue, darling; I have an
 idea!

What I could n't accomplish in my own person?

as she had looked at him

Do I look like your father's wife?"

Can I call
 you Mother?"

Sue
 thereupon could not refrain from instantly doing likewise,.

You may call me Mother,, my poor dear!

" I never was."


---

---
Of course not," said Sue quickly;" since she was hating you all the
 time!"


---
Both Sue and Jude together went to the office of the district

As she read the
 four- square undertaking

, never before seen by her,

to be
 made permanent, her face seemed.

 not lovers, she thought).

She could not bear its aspect.

Coming after her

She was usually leading little Father Time by the hand,

She was allotted the spare room in
 Jude's house,,.

As, however, she could not sleep, and

that Sue and Jude
 were still sitting up

discovered-- it being in fact only ten o'clock-- she dressed
 herself again and

Sue breathed uneasily.

She ran away from him, with their child,
 to her friends; and

while she was there

she would n't give it
 up.

His wife went mad.

" Jude, I want," she said,

But I suppose.

 murmured.

Sue, Jude, and the widow stood in the background

She met him at the gaol gates, and.

Sue turned her head and.

her mouth shaping itself like that of
 a child about to give way to grief

her little voice began
 anew:"

 would

 character,

And the other poor soul-- to
 escape a nominal shame degrading herself to the real shame of bondage to a tyrant
-- a man whom to avoid for ever was her only chance of
 salvation...

Sue said. 
---
she supposed

" Let," she said," and

her mechanical
 murmur of words whose meaning

It is not the same to her, poor thing, as it would be to me doing it
 over again with my present knowledge

 least as I have, by experience, and to my own too squeamish feelings
 perhaps sometimes, it really does seem immoral in me

knowing this, are proposing
 to perjure ourselves," she said.

I fancy

I do think it--

While she hesitated

just as she did

Sue still held.

till Sue said more brightly:

Sue sighed.

what some women fail,
---
" No-- don't let," she continued. 
---
from the London train alights a
 couple; a short, rather bloated man, with a globular stomach and
 small legs, resembling a top on two pegs, accompanied by a woman of
 rather fine figure and rather red face, dressed in black material,
 and,.

Perhaps I can pick up a cheap bit of
 furniture or old china.

---
when her attention
 was attracted by a young couple leading a child, who had come out
 from the second platform, into which the train from Aldbrickham had
 steamed
---
" Sakes alive!" said Arabella.


---
when Arabella was new to him
---
Arabella so regulated her pace and her husband's as. 
---
Her answers to Cartlett's remarks
 were vague and slight, for the group in front interested her more
 than all the rest of the spectacle.


---
," said Arabella with a curious,
 sudden covetousness. 
---
although the smouldering maternal instinct was strong enough
 in her
---
But to lead her to quash her husband's conjecture, she was not
. 
---
" Oh I suppose not. 
---
She looks quite a girl."


---
The unwitting Sue and Jude, the couple
 in question, had determined. 
---
Sue, in her
 new summer clothes, flexible and light as a bird, her little thumb
 stuck up by the stem of her white cotton sunshade,. 
---
as if
 she hardly touched ground, and
---
as if a moderately strong puff of wind
 would float her over the hedge into the next field

The pair with their charge passed through the turnstiles, Arabella
 and her husband not far behind them. 
---
When inside the enclosure the
 publican's wife could see
---
How she sticks to him!
---
"" said Arabella. 
---
" Oh no-- I fancy... 
---
I
 wonder!"


---
" But I thought?"


---
I heard I should be ashamed of
 making myself so silly if I were he!"

" I do n't see as how there's anything remarkable in their behaviour.
 I should never have noticed,."

"," she rejoined. 
---
attracted by
 what Arabella's sharpened vision discerned
---
as if she were some fairy
---
She's not a particular warm- hearted creature to my
 thinking,
---
though she cares for him pretty middling much
---
-- as much as
 she's able to; and
---
her heart ache a bit--
---
the she d where malting processes were being exhibited,
 and Arabella in the direction taken by Jude and Sue. 
---
Before,
 however, she had regained
---
their wake a laughing face met her own,
 and
---
she was confronted by Anny, the friend of her girlhood.


---
" I am still living down there," she said, as soon as
 she was composed. 
---
" I am soon going, but
---
though I've lost the rest of'em for the present
---
I saw'em by now."


---
" I do n't know."


---
She's
---
" pretty, is n't she!"


---
" I do n't know but

I ought

---
" Well, and what woman do n't I should like? 
---
As for that body
 with him-- she do n't know!

I
 can see in her face."

"

she do n't

what she calls love

Why,, I verily believe!

I was just saying."

that you do n't look a day older than
 when you knew me as a girl

Arabella was induced.


---
I taught him the dead languages.

---
Arabella and her friends came to it in due course, and
---
" Admiring their own work," said Arabella. 
---
Arabella did not care;

---
if they should recognize her
---
She walked round the outside of the listening throng,
---
, whose movements had an unexpected fascination for
 her to- day. 
---
Scrutinizing them narrowly from the rear she noticed
.

Arabella whispered to herself
 morosely,
---
as she rejoined her companions,
---
with whom she preserved a
 preoccupied silence.


---
the physician to Arabella, apart;" do you want anything
 such as this, Mrs. Cartlett
---
She produced five shillings
---
that she was due at an appointment with her husband
---
Saying
 presently, she
 sauntered away towards the refreshment bar, Jude, his companion, and
 the child having gone on to the horticultural tent, where Arabella
 caught a glimpse of them standing before a group of roses in bloom.


---
She waited a few minutes and. 
---
She found.


---
Arabella
 remarked gloomily. 
---
what could I do but" Well, now we have met," she returned, ready to quarrel
 with the sun for shining on her. 
---
at which she gazed
---
her eyes sparkle with vivacity
---
She adored roses,
 and.


---
what Arabella had witnessed
---
while she learnt the names of this variety and that
---
she had

---
so that her nose went among the petals
---
Then she looked up at him, and.


---
that told so much to
 Arabella
---
She nodded.


---
But, she went on
---
And
 she looked at the aged child, whom.


---
discussed by
 other persons than Arabella
---
who had
 previously been called Mrs. Bridehead
---
Sue, now openly adopted the name of
 Mrs. Fawley. 
---
Her dull, cowed, and listless manner for days seemed
.


---
The baker's lad and the grocer's boy, to lift
 their hats gallantly to Sue to execute their errands no longer took the trouble,
 and
---
when they encountered her
---
Sue was always.


---
she saddened
---
"," said she presently. 
---
" I am much depressed
 by the way they look at me here. 
---
I could
 not let! 
---
; I do hope! 
---
I shall be moving about."


---
" I shall do something too, of course, till-- till-- 
---
Well, now I ca n't
 be useful in the lettering."


---
Sue could hear
 the conversation:

... 
---
On the second morning Sue came, and also.


---
what assistance
 she could render
---
The silence and emptiness of the building gave her confidence, and,

---
which she was
 nevertheless timid at mounting
---
standing on a safe low platform,, she began. 
---
She was quite pleased at her powers
---
; she had acquired them
 in the days she painted illumined texts for the church- fitting shop
 at Christminster. 
---
that a young woman
 was assisting
---
Sue had told him. 
---
She came down from her perch,
 and?"


---
Sue returned to her work. 
---
Sue recognized
 her as one who had friends in Spring Street, whom she visited. 
---
The
 church- cleaner looked at Sue,
---
gaped, and lifted her hands; she had

---
as the latter had recognized
 her
---
as Sue stood reaching upward
---
her
 hand tracing the letters, and
---
till she grew so nervous that she
 trembled visibly
---
Sue could not hear which--"She's his wife
---
Then she ought
---
, who had been talking to the old woman
---
what she meant by calling them strange people
---
Sue and Jude, working, sent back the child to school, and
---
she had been crying
 silently
---
However, in a few minutes Sue
 seemed.


---
she laughed
---
"," she said,"! 
---
And with her hand over her eyes she laughed again
 silently and intermittently,.


---
till she was quite weak
---
" she sighed. 
---
as she took up the
 brush and
---
Sue cleansed her brush.

---
she, dropping to her tragic note
---
Sue for the last time cooked her
 own
---
to be a wet day; moreover Sue was unwell, and

---
not wishing to desert her poor Jude in such gloomy circumstances,
 to stay awhile, she acted on the suggestion of
 the auctioneer's man, and.

---
Sue silently took
 her companion's hand, and
---
Because Arabella is there?"


---
I must do
 something, if not church- gothic."

" I wish," she said,. 
---
" I am
. 
---
" I am not skilled in those... 
---
I ought. 
---
I
 grew up in the baking business with aunt,. 
---
They were Sue's pets, and
---
Sue tried
---
as she heard the trifling sum that her dears were deemed to be worth
 advanced by small stages to the price
---
When she was left alone
---
she waited patiently, but
---
At last she started, and on passing the
 poulterer's shop, not far off
---
, she saw her pigeons in a hamper by the
 door. 
---
her to act on impulse
---
first looking around her
 quickly, she pulled out the peg which fastened down the cover, and
. 
---
Sue reached the lodging trembling, and. 
---
" she asked breathlessly.


---
" Yes, I think. 
---
Why?"

" Because, then, I've done such a wicked thing!" 
---
And she explained,
 in bitter contrition.


---
I shall have
---
" Yes!" said Sue vehemently.


---
which Sue had occupied
---
On a Saturday evening in May, nearly three years after Arabella's
 recognition of Sue and himself at the agricultural show, some of
 those met again.


---
Her sombre suit, of pronounced cut, caused
.


---
her to appear a little out of place in the medley and bustle of a
 provincial fair
---
"," said the
 woman in weeds reprovingly. 
---
" I do n't care to. 
---
The companions then went their several ways, the one in crape walking
 firmly along with a mien of disconnection from her miscellaneous
 surroundings. 
---
she came to a hoarding,
---
Having ascertained thus much the immensely weeded widow retraced her
 steps, and.

---
By and by her attention was arrested by a little stall of cakes and
 ginger- breads,. 
---
tended by a young woman apparently unused to the business
---
, she being
 accompanied by a boy with an octogenarian face, who assisted her.


---
" Upon my-- senses!" murmured the widow to herself. 
---
if
 she is so
---
" His wife Sue--!"  She drew nearer to the stall. "
---
" she said blandly.


---
Sue changed colour and.


---
?" she said stiffly. 
---
her voice grew sympathetic in spite of herself
---
, I expect?"


---
" Yes, I do. 
---
You be the woman I thought wer my mother for a bit, till
 I found you was n't
---
Arabella continued:
---
her tender
 little mouth began.


---
And Sue's lips quivered again. 
---
but she's leaving soon
---
She had helped
 herself, and
---
" Still harping on Christminster-- even in his cakes!" laughed
 Arabella. 
---
Sue sighed, and
---
she looked her distress at hearing him criticized.

"
---
Arabella was quizzing Sue with more regard of how she was speaking
 than of what she was saying. 
---
a woman selling

---
"!" she said. 
---
She shook her head. 
---
" Because of the divorce, I suppose?"

" That and other things. 
---
" I do n't care."


---
Here in Kennetbridge?"

 Sue's manner showed Arabella.

"
---
that her random guess was right
---
," continued Arabella. 
---
" she
 cried.


---
" Very well-- though I half- feel!... 
---
as if I should like
---
But Lord, I do n't want
---
I should
 sin! 
---
though I should think
---
that I know
---
I am not the
 woman to find fault with what the Lord has ordained. 
---
I've reached a
 more resigned frame of mind."


---
" Indeed!  I wish."


---
I had been able to do so
---
Then Arabella wished Sue good- bye, and.




---
Arabella Cartlett and her
 weeds stood among them. 
---
She had a clear, powerful voice,.


---
Arabella was in a thoughtful mood; but

---
her thoughts were not of the new chapel,.


---
at last said Arabella sullenly. 
---
" I
 came here to- day. 
---
Anny, I've heard of un again, and
---
I've seen
 HER!"


---
" I've heard of Jude, and
---
I've seen his wife. 
---
I will
---
though I sung the hymns
---
wi' all my strength, I have not
 been able to help thinking about' n;."


---
which I've no right to do as a
 chapel member
---
" I do. 
---
" Well-- I know o' my own, too! 
---
I had my struggles!" 
---
, her lover having jilted her.)


---
" What shall I do about it?"
---
urged Arabella morbidly.


---
" I haven't a morsel!--and... 
---
if I had
---
in which Arabella and Jude had lived during the first months of
 their marriage, and
---
were passing the lonely
 house, she could
 control herself no longer.


---
After all
 that's said about the comforts of this religion, I wish I had Jude
 back again!"

 And I've heard."

 I know as well as you what I should do; only I do n't do it!"

" she burst out. 
---
Arabella had hastily drawn from her pocket a bundle of tracts which
 she had brought with her to distribute at the fair, and of which she
 had given away several. 
---
As she spoke
---
she flung the whole remainder
 of the packet into the hedge. 
---
Arabella did calm herself down by degrees; and
---
Arabella looked at him, and
---
she spoke.

---
though her loss was a loss to me in more ways than one
---
You lost your school and good income through her
---
the vicar having known me before my so- called eccentric
 conduct towards my wife
---
She has done
 no better."


---
" She is not doing well,"


---
she is
 anything but thriving. 
---
You
 made a fool of a mistake about her and
---
" She was innocent."


---
She was quite innocent of
 what obtained you your freedom, at the time you obtained it. 
---
Still-- she wanted
---
But you should n't have let her. 
---
That's the only way with
 these fanciful women that chaw high-- innocent or guilty. 
---
She'd have
. 
---
she's fond of her man still
---
You were too quick about her. 
---
her go
---
There's nothing like
 bondage and a stone- deaf taskmaster for taming us women. 
---
the woman shall bear her iniquity
---
Well; she's got
 her deserts now."


---
In the meantime Sue, though remarkably successful in her cake- selling
 experiment at Kennetbridge fair, had lost the temporary brightness
 which had begun to sit upon her sadness on account of that success.

---
till they met an old woman carrying a child in short clothes,
 and
---
Sue kissed the children, and?"


---
She told him the
 pecuniary results, and. 
---
At last,, she informed him of the unexpected meeting with Arabella, and
 the latter's widowhood.


---
What-- is she living here
---
No; at Alfredston," said Sue.


---
" I thought?"
---
I had
---
she continued,.


---
What is she doing there?"


---
She told him all she knew. "
---
She has taken to chapel- going
---
," Sue
 added;" and."


---
Sue asked, a troublousness in her
 tones.


---
it would surprise
 her, perhaps,
---
if she did n't mind
---
" she said pensively.

---
Well, I do
---
", I ca n't help it. 
---
I love the place----
---
although I know

---
,, I see!... 
---
I pray so!... 
---
I should like! 
---
In two or three weeks I
 might, I think. 
---
I should like."


---
And she humbled her body greatly, and all the places
     of her joy she filled with her torn hair."--ESTHER( Apoc.).


      
---
"," said Sue. 
---
"!" she said,.


---
" Oh, I must n't let; and
---
?" she asked.


---
She saw from his face. 
---
"," she answered. 
---
" I am
 sure this sight will awaken old sorrows in you, and do no good!"


---
while Sue and the others kept immediately behind him
---
" They are only learned Doctors," said Sue.


---
Sue again wished.


---
"" said a woman.


---
Sue's face grew more emotional; but
---
though she stood close to Jude

---
she was screened.


---
I may do some good
---
before I am dead
---
" I was, perhaps, after all, a paltry victim
 to the spirit of mental and social restlessness that makes so many
 unhappy in these days!"


---
what I appear
---
I am in a chaos of principles-- groping in the dark--. 
---
when I came
 here first
---
Eight or nine years ago, I had a neat stock of fixed opinions, but
---
the further I get the less sure I am. 
---
I doubt
. 
---
if I have anything more for my present rule of life than following
 inclinations which do me and nobody else any harm, and
---
I love best
---
how I was getting on
---
I can not explain further here. 
---
I perceive
---
Sue only possessed a small one, half sunshade. 
---
She
 had grown pale,.


---
" Let," she whispered,.

---
the newcomers knocked at the
 door of one, which a woman opened.


---
The householder scrutinized Sue's figure a moment. 
---
she, shutting the door
---
Now, Jude," said
 Sue,". 
---
I am
 sorry to say
---
I do n't like
 Christminster
---
" I'd rather not!" the boy rejoined.

," said Sue. 
---
" I'll pull my cloak more round
 me... 
---
How do I look now, dear?"


---
The woman
 here was more amiable; but
---
she had little room to spare, and. 
---
They came to terms with
 her,. 
---
though her price was rather high for their pockets
---
in this house Sue took possession of a back room
 on the second floor with an inner closet- room for the children. 
---
she had taken in
---
after admitting several
 facts as to their late difficulties and wanderings, she was
---
Are you really a married woman
---
Sue hesitated; and
---
Sue had not the art of prevarication, and, startled
 by the landlady saying suddenly:

"?"

 then impulsively told the woman each been unhappy in their first marriages, after
 which, terrified at the thought of a second irrevocable union, and

---
Therefore, though in her own sense of the words she was a married
 woman, in the landlady's sense
---
she was not.


---
Sue sat by
 the window in a reverie,. 
---
she was explaining to him the incoming of
 the lodgers during his absence.


---
The wife expostulated, but,
---
; for presently a tap came to Sue's door, and
---
the woman
 appeared.


---
when I said a single man" I am sorry to tell you, ma'am," she said,". 
---
that I ca n't let
---
My husband objects; and therefore
 I must ask you. 
---
I do n't mind; but
---
I shall be glad."


---
Though she knew
---
that she was entitled to the lodging for a week
---
, Sue
 did not wish,
 and
---
she said. 
---
she would leave
---
gone Sue looked out of the window again. 
---
she proposed to the boy
---
Therefore, instead of unpacking her boxes,, they sallied out into the damp though
 not unpleasant streets,. 
---
Sue resolving
---
In the company of the boy she
 wandered into this street and into that; but
---
though she tried a dozen
 different houses she fared far worse alone than she had fared in
 Jude's company, and
---
Every householder looked askance at such a woman and
 child inquiring for accommodation in the gloom.


---
" I ought
---
not to be born, ought I?
---
Thoroughly tired at last Sue returned to the place where she was
 not welcome, but. 
---
where at least she had temporary shelter
---
knowing she adhered to her determination not to disturb him till the next
 day.

II


 Sue sat
---
then she regarded the scene
 outside the uncurtained window. 
---
she occupied
---
She thought of
 the strange operation of a simple- minded man's ruling passion,. 
---
"" said Sue despondently. 
---
" I am afraid this will
 trouble your father."


---
" I wish, and
---
"

"

" Can I do anything?"


---
that you are not my real mother,
 and
---
I ought
---
I troubled'em in Australia,
 and
---
I trouble folk here. 
---
I wish!"


---
I had n't been born
---
" I think!"


---
Sue did not reply. 
---
She was doubtfully pondering.


---
She at last concluded.


---
that, so far, she
 would be honest and candid with one who entered into her difficulties
 like an aged friend
---
" to be another in our family soon," she hesitatingly
 remarked.


---
" Yes, I have.


---
, I am sorry to say!"
---
murmured Sue,
---
her eyes glistening
 with suspended tears
---
she pleaded,.
---
" I ca n't explain--. 
---
as if I had done it on purpose
---
I ca n't explain, dear! 
---
-- I ca n't help it!"


---
I wo n't forgive you, ever, ever! 
---
I'll
 never believe!"


---
There she heard!"


---
that, dear," she cried, rather peremptorily
---
The following morning she awoke at a little past six, and. 
---
her to be his quarters,
---
She arose softly,.


---
as she knew
---
She found Jude at breakfast in the obscure tavern he had chosen as a
 counterpoise to the expense of her lodging: and
---
she explained to him
 her homelessness. 
---
She joined Jude in a hasty meal, and
---
On reaching the place and going upstairs she
 found. 
---
which she had brought with her
---
a couple of eggs she put
 them into the boiling kettle, and.


---
while she went,
---
A shriek from Sue suddenly caused
. 
---
as she pushed
 it back
---
that Sue had sunk to the floor just within it
---
those of the girl and the baby boy were.


---
Sue lie,
---
Sue had come to herself, and
---
the two helpless
 women, bending over the children in wild efforts to restore them,
 and the triplet of little corpses, formed a sight which overthrew
 his self- command. 
---
They carried her away against her; and
---
there she lay, her slight figure shaken with her
 gasps, and
---
her eyes staring at the ceiling
---
, the woman of the house
 vainly trying.


---
she implored, and. 
---
that,, her presence might
 do harm, and the reminder that it was necessary to take care of
 herself lest she should endanger a coming life
---
Her inquiries were
 incessant, and
---
as she could speak
---
As soon she informed him.


---
what she had said to the
 boy, and
---
how she thought herself the cause of this
---
this stimulated Sue to efforts of sympathy which in
 some degree distracted her from her poignant self- reproach
---
, she was allowed.


---
" said Sue, her spasmodic breathing suspended.


---
I suppose
---
She sobbed again. 
---
" moaned Sue. 
---
Then another silence, till she was seized with another uncontrollable
 fit of grief. 
---
she went back again to her room. 
---
The baby's
 frock, shoes, and socks,, she would not now have removed,
---
have got them out of her sight. 
---
But she
 implored him, and.


---
when she also attempted
---
" she cried out, after
 one of these. 
---
too obscurely.--Why
 was I half- wiser than my fellow- women
---
she afforded us-- instincts which
 civilization had taken upon itself to thwart
---
She sank into a quiet contemplation,
---
till she said,
---
-- I see! 
---
Again Sue looked at the hanging little frock and at the socks and
 shoes; and
---
her figure quivered like a string. 
---
I am a pitiable
 creature
---
"," she said," good neither for earth nor heaven any more!

---
I am driven out of my mind by things! 
---
She stared at Jude, and.


---
She paused. 
---
" she asked heavily.


---
After such momentary diversions her grief would return in a wave.


---
Sue had declared. 
---
that she would follow the two little
 ones to the grave, but at the last moment she gave way, and
---
while she was lying
 down
---
The woman thought, but
.

---
she was still lying down
---
that she was not in her bedroom after all
---
Her hat and jacket, too, were
---
missing: she had gone out. 
---
She had not
 been there. 
---
It was Sue,
---
which she had never thought of changing for the mourning he
 had bought
---
till I've seen my little ones
 again
---
" she cried wildly. 
---
when she saw Jude
---
" I want. 
---
Oh Jude-- please Jude-- I want! 
---
I did n't know you
! 
---
while I was asleep
---
She's been wanting
---
her get
 to the coffins
---
" She ought. 
---
She is hardly responsible, poor thing,
 seemingly. 
---
But Sue kept! 
---
Thus she went on. 
---
her to support her
---
whispered tenderly, and put his arm round; till
 she helplessly gave in, and.

Sue was

III


 Sue was convalescent,. 
---
though she had hoped for death, and
---
Vague
 and quaint imaginings had haunted Sue in the days
---
when her intellect
 scintillated like a star
---
herself fleeing from a persecutor
---
she said mournfully. 
---
" True!" she murmured. 
---
" No, no, Jude!" she said quickly. 
---
" I should have, just the same. 
---
that she was not the Sue of their earlier time
---
Yes," she said, with a little quiver in her words,".

---
I have had
 dreadful fears, a dreadful sense of my own insolence of action
---
I have thought--!"


---
that I am still his wife
---
" Good God, dearest!--why?"

" Oh I ca n't explain! 
---
Sue sighed uneasily.


---
that Sue and himself had mentally travelled in opposite directions
 since the tragedy: events which had enlarged his own views of life,
 laws, customs, and dogmas
---
She was no longer the same as in the independent days, when
 her intellect played like lambent lightning over conventions and
 formalities which he at that time respected, though he did not now.


---
She was
 not at home, but
---
she soon returned,.


---
What are you thinking of, little woman
---
" Sue-- my own too suffering dear!--there's no evil woman in you. 
---
And, you are absolutely the most ethereal, least sensual
 woman I ever knew to exist without inhuman sexlessness. 
---
as if
 she were an infant
---
not to stay like this," she murmured,.

"
---
when she had remained
 in the position a long while
---
She paused, and. 
---
" Never," she whispered.


---
she had

---
that she was wide awake
 all the time
---
She sat upright and.


---
"  She stopped. 
---
till she
 could control the lumpiness of her throat
---
You certainly ARE my wife, Sue, in all but
 law. 
---
a woman's form appeared.


---
she sat down in the window
 bench,;
 but
---
where they could distinctly see her outline against the light
---
that she was not
,
---
as she
 had been during Cartlett's lifetime
---
though she had never replied to his letter
---
" I have just come from the cemetery
---
," she said. 
---
" I inquired and
. 
---
I could n't come to the funeral
---
I read all about it in the papers,
 and
---
I felt... 
---
I was n't wanted
---
No-- I could n't come to the funeral,"

---
But I am glad I
 found the grave. 
---
" I shall put up a headstone
---
A sigh came from the dark corner where Sue sat.


---
The unexpectedness of her words struck Jude silent.


---
"," said Arabella. 
---
" I thought!"


---
that her new and
 transcendental views lurked in her words
---
missed by Arabella
---
after evincing that she was struck by Sue's avowal
---
went on to talk with placid bluntness about",
 she now exhibited a ceremonial mournfulness. 
---
She alluded to the past, and. 
---
: Sue had
 invisibly left the room.


---
She said?"
---
she was not your wife
---
" Why should she do that?"


---
" I can not inform you
---
" She is,? 
---
is n't she
---
She once told me so."


---
what she says
---
Mother died
 of dys. 
---
Jude's former wife had maintained a stereotyped manner of strict good
 breeding even now that Sue was gone, and. 
---
When
 she had departed Jude, much relieved
---
what had become of her
---
she
 had not come in
---
that Sue might have gone to St. Silas' church,

---
as she often went there
---
" She knows somebody who keeps the key, and."


---
she has it
---
whenever she
 wants it
---
" How long has she been going on with this?"


---
" Sue!" he whispered.


---
; she had turned up her face.

"
---
she said almost sharply.

---
I wanted! 
---
Why do I come? 
---
, I should like,! 
---
if
 I have not
---
Do n't criticize me, Jude-- I ca n't bear. 
---
as I am
---
I am a wretch-- broken by my
 distractions! 
---
I could n't BEAR it
---
when Arabella came--
---
I felt so
 utterly miserable I had to come away. 
---
She seems, and
---
I see marriage differently now. 
---
Arabella's child
 killing mine was a judgement-- the right slaying the wrong. 
---
What,
 WHAT shall I do! 
---
I am such a vile creature-- too worthless to mix
 with ordinary human beings!"


---
though she came
---
, she preferred.


---
"," she said in a sweet and imploring voice.

---
" I love you as much as ever! 
---
Only-- I ought
---
" I ca n't own it."


---
" But I have made up my mind! 
---
that I am not your wife
---
I belong to
 him
---
-- I sacramentally joined myself to him for life. 
---
is it common to woman? 
---
Is a woman a thinking
 unit at all, or a fraction always wanting its integer? 
---
she had returned the key. "
---
Can this be the girl
---
when she came back,
---
;" can this be the girl who brought
 the pagan deities into this most Christian city?--who Shelley, and Mill? 
---
when she crushed them with her heel?--quoted Gibbon
---
" Oh do n't, do n't be so cruel to me, Jude, and I so unhappy!" she
 sobbed. 
---
Arabella's coming was the
 finish. 
---
before she could hinder him
---
She said. 
---
she wanted no supper, and

---
Turning she found. 
---
She
 went to him, and."


---
An average woman is
 in this superior to an average man--
---
that she never instigates
---
if you had n't
 broken me down by making me fear you would go back to her
---
which undermines some women's morals

---
you go-- possibly to Arabella
 again--
---
Sue burst out. 
---
The woman mostly gets the worst of
 it in the long run!"


---
" She does."


---
Unless she is absolutely worthless and contemptible. 
---
Sue drew a nervous breath or two. 
---
" She is--
---
Sue looked at him, and
---
"!" she brokenly murmured. 
---
she, starting up
---
till she said," Good- bye,
 good- bye
---
she got free,
---
as you did see
 her
---
I might have.  I have good
 reason for supposing that she was innocent when I divorced her-- that
 I was all wrong Awkward, is n't it?"


---
" She has taken care, anyhow, apparently."

" H'm.
---
Arabella having made her home at Alfredston, and
---
where she had stayed much longer
---
than she
 had
---
she was approaching the town
---
," she replied. 
---
where I lived
 as maid and wife, and all the past things of my life that are
 interesting to my feelings
---
; for I've been visiting at
 Christminster
---
Yes; I've seen Jude."


---
She do n't live with him any
 longer. 
---
I only heard of it as a certainty;
---
just before I left
---
though
 I had thought."


---
when I
 called on them
---
Why, I should have thought'."


---
She has never really married him
. 
---
And now, instead
 of this sad event making, and get, she's took in a queer religious way,
---
just as I was in my
 affliction at losing Cartlett
---
And she says,."


---
so I was told,-- yours only; and
---
that she's your wife in the
 eye of Heaven and the Church
---
And
 perhaps she feels, over and above other things,. 
---
that I ought
---
I ca n't say. 
---
However, as for me, I am soon off
 from here. 
---
I've got, and
---
I hope."


---
Arabella gave it.


---
Arabella smiled grimly from where the pollard willows begin
 to the old almshouses in the first street of the town.


---
as she resumed her way, and
---
Sue coming out of
 the door
---
that her recalcitrant
 spirit would soon have been broken
---
that she came willingly
---
that now she was gone
---
her be
---
if she were anybody's wife
---
that she was
 the wife of the man to whom she had borne three children and owed
 such tragical adventures
---
She's affected by Christminster
 sentiment and teaching. 
---
where she got them
---
that it has done little
 more than finish her education
---
what that woman said
---
that her views had considerably changed
---
that she should come to him there at Marygreen
---
I would rather not come in. 
---
I want
."


---
It had been in the trembling accents of Sue.

---
too much affected to go on talking at first; she, too, was
 now such a mere cluster of nerves and
---
" But you are MY wife! 
---
," she answered with despairing
 self- suppression. 
---
" But I am going. 
---
Strictly speaking you, too-- don't mind my saying
 it, Jude!--you should take back-- Arabella."


---
" I should? 
---
" I should have felt just the same--.

---
And I would go back to Richard without repeating the sacrament,. 
---
The blow of her
 bereavement seemed. 
---
her conviction was proof against
 all. 
---
on which she was firm
---
that her firmness in this had left her tottering in every other
 impulse and
---
she possessed
---
" to tell it you myself," she said in cut tones;". 
---
I
 have even owned the extreme fact that I do not love him. 
---
I did not
 think! 
---
I was going?"


---
But I suppose."


---
" Why, of course I will. 
---
" No-- I wo n't let him. 
---
I go to him voluntarily,. 
---
just as I went away
 from him
---
She was so sadly sweet in what he called her wrong- headedness that
 Jude could not help being moved to tears more than once for pity of
 her. 
---
" I never knew such a woman for doing impulsive penances, as
 you, Sue! 
---
Jude, I must say good- bye! 
---
But I wanted
. 
---
Sue had been there often, and
---
she knew the way
 to the spot in the dark. 
---
I should like to part
---
," said she.


---
because I have acted on conviction
---
Sue's slim shape was only just discernible going towards the
 station.


---
Sue's gone from me--!"
---
She in the meantime had left by the train, and. 
---
where she entered the steam- tram and
---
She wished
---
, she said,.


---
she hired at the Bear
---
The little car to drive her to
 Marygreen set her down at the end of the lane, half a mile from the
 village, by her desire, and. 
---
as she had brought
---
On its return she
 encountered it, and. 
---
that her things
 had been taken in by the schoolmaster himself
---
She could now enter Marygreen without exciting much observation.

---
She crossed by the well and under the trees to the pretty new school
 on the other side, and. 
---
I've come, Richard
---
she, looking pale and shaken, and
---
I can not believe
---
"-- you forgive your-- wife!"


---
" Everything, darling Susanna," said Phillotson.


---
She started at the endearment,. 
---
Then she nerved herself again.


---
I am
 glad-- almost. 
---
Sue imperceptibly shrank away,.


---
" Oh no, dear-- I have been driving through the damp, and
---
I was
 chilly!
---
" she said, with a hurried smile of apprehension. 
---
" to have the marriage"

" To- morrow morning, early, I thought--. 
---
I am

---
I have told
 him all, and
---
" Yes, yes, I can! 
---
I want. 
---
-- I ca n't wait long!"


---
I'll tell? 
---
Unlike a woman in ordinary, whose eye is so keen for material things
---
,
 Sue seemed. 
---
But on moving across the parlour to put down her
 muff she uttered a little" Oh!" and. 
---
in placing her muff
 upon it her eye had caught a document which lay there. 
---
" Oh-- only
 a-- funny surprise!" she said,.


---
as she
 came back to the table
---
Sue nervously
 made herself agreeable to him by talking on whatever she thought
 likely to interest him, except herself,. 
---
She obediently ate some supper, and. 
---
The old woman accompanied Sue to her temporary quarters, and. 
---
Among other things she laid out a night- gown
.


---
" Oh said Sue quickly. 
---
" I did n't
 mean. 
---
She handed a new and
 absolutely plain garment, of coarse and unbleached calico.


---
She took it, and, the tears
 resounding through the house like a screech- owl.


---
Mrs. Edlin lifted her hands, and
---
Sue excitedly continued.


---
Sue repeated. 
---
Sue flung her face upon the bed,. 
---
She remained, and.


---
I'm bound"  She remained with her face in the bed- clothes, and
---
A light was burning in Sue's room,.


---
Gillingham had evidently been impressed with the indefinable charm of
 Sue, and. 
---
She ca n't very well go a second time. 
---
her being
---
what
 she is
---
Apart from, of course, a luxury for a fogey like me, it will set me right
 in the eyes of the clergy and orthodox laity, who have never forgiven
 me for letting her go. 
---
if you've got any sound reason for marrying her again
---
if you
 had n't been so weak about her
---
her housed again,
---
her go
---
Whatever justice
 there was in releasing her
---
that the reactionary spirit would make Phillotson more orthodoxly cruel to her
 than he had erstwhile been informally and perversely kind.


---
Women are so strange in their influence
 that they tempt you to misplaced kindness. 
---
She'll come to any terms in time."


---
when I left after the row
 that was made about my agreeing to her elopement The only thing
 to retrieve your position and hers is.' 
---
if she'll come, and
---
But I was
 so headstrong at that time that I paid no heed.  And that after the
 divorce she should have thought of doing so."


---
She's forcing herself to it, poor dear little thing; and
. 
---
you've no notion what she's suffering
---
her do this
---
it was
 very good and forgiving of' ee to take her to' ee again
---
She's his wife. 
---
She's had three
 children by him, and
---
it's a wicked shame to
 egg her on to this, poor little quivering thing! 
---
She's got nobody
 on her side. 
---
who'd be her friend
---
What first put her into this mood o'
 mind
---
It is all voluntary on her part.

---
When Mrs. Edlin had gone back to her cottage Phillotson
---
If she is really compelling herself to this against her
 instincts--
---
her wait a bit
---
when she gave that little cry at sight of the licence
---
But they do n't know Sue.

---
she has ever done anything against her conscience
---
At the time
 she left me for him
---
she thought. 
---
she was quite within her right
---
Now
 she thinks otherwise."


---
what she was pleased to call her principles
---
her name connoted as she did in that pallid
 morning light
---
Chastened, world- weary, remorseful, the strain on her
 nerves had preyed upon her flesh and bones, and
---
she appeared smaller
 in outline than she had formerly done,.


---
though Sue had not been a
 large woman in her days of rudest health
---
they left the house, Widow Edlin
 continuing steadfast in her refusal to assist in the ceremony.


---
"?" said Sue. 
---
She had not lived there for any
 length of time.


---
Sue said no more;
---
her go
---
when the
 clergyman came to the words," What God hath joined," a woman's voice
 from among these was heard to utter audibly:

" God hath jined indeed
---
Sue was making a pretence of doing
 some housewifery. 
---
as if she lived there
---
But she seemed timid at his
 approach, and
---
Sue brightened a little.




---
A woman in shabby black stood on the doorstep,
.


---
for a woman to keep virtuous
---
The woman in the rain was Arabella,.


---
" said Arabella. 
---
She bent her head against
 the doorpost and.


---
" She has really taken me; but

---
till she
 could get out of the strait
---
she was in-- not by her own fault,-- and.


---
as she
 declared
---
Arabella said:"?"


---
, I suppose
---
" I guess; but
---
I know nothing."


---
" I had a letter from Anny at Alfredston to- day.
---
She had just heard
: but
---
she did n't know."


---
" I do n't wish."


---
what kind of woman--"

" Do n't speak of her I say
---
She's a fool! 
---
And she's an angel, too,
 poor dear!"


---
Arabella was duly installed in the little attic, and
---
at first she
 did not come near Jude at all. 
---
She went to and
---
fro about her own
 business, was that of obtaining another place in
 the occupation she understood best. 
---
, she shook her
 head. "
---
," she said.
---
On the Sunday morning following,, she meekly asked him
---
if she might come in to breakfast
 with him, and
---
as she had broken her teapot,
---
she suddenly observed:. 
---
I'm sorry for you."


---
" I am all in a brood."


---
" It is about her,. 
---
I know
---
I could find
 out all about the wedding--."


---
" I wanted. 
---
I left there
---
And
 I could see Anny, who'll be sure to have heard all about it,."


---
as she
 has friends at Marygreen
---
Arabella went,. 
---
When she had gone
---
She's nothing to
 me-- nor the other neither!"


---
she might bring, and
---
Arabella had made dimples
 most successfully all the way home, and
---
when she stepped out of the
 railway carriage
---
she smiled. 
---
She observed, however, the
 hard strain upon his lip as he spoke.


---
she has heard from Belinda, her relation out at Marygreen,
 that it was very sad, and curious
---
She wanted
---
to marry him again, did n't she?

---
She wanted to in one sense, but not in the
 other. 
---
But Sue was that excited about it that she burnt her
 best embroidery that she'd worn with you, to blot you out entirely.

---
if a woman feels
---
Well-- like it, she ought. 
---
I commend her
 for it,." 
---
Arabella sighed. 
---
" She felt. 
---
that she belonged to nobody else in the sight of
 God A'mighty
---
Perhaps another woman feels the same
 about herself, too!" 
---
Arabella sighed again.


---
" I do n't want!"
---
ca nt," said Arabella. 
---
" I feel exactly the same as she!"


---
I am not going
 back to my lodgings just yet." 
---
Among
 the possible consequences of her marriage Sue had not dwelt on this.


---
Arabella, meanwhile, had gone back. 
---
Well," she said to him,". 
---
for all your rowing me that night, I've
 called in,
---
for I have something to tell you
---
I think I shall get
 married and. 
---
" I'll do anything to get thee off my hands!"


---
I am now going. 
---
I'm afraid, and
---
I must get him home. 
---
I want
---
in case I should want, and
---
" I thought!"


---
She then sallied out again, and
---
where she had been
 barmaid for a brief term
---
She had
---
she entered and.


---
I'm trying:
---
But
 I ca n't;
---
and I am going home." 
---
She saw.


---
" I've come entirely, dear boy. 
---
Arabella held up her
 finger to the barmaid. 
---
I'll treat you, poor chap!"


---
" I do n't care which! 
---
Sue has served me badly,
 very badly. 
---
I did n't expect it of Sue! 
---
I stuck to her, and
---
she
 ought. 
---
I'd have sold my soul for her sake, but

---
she would n't risk hers a jot for me. 
---
To save her own soul she lets
!... 
---
But it is n't her fault, poor little girl
---
-- I am
 sure it is n't!"


---
How Arabella had obtained money. 
---
she ordered a
 liqueur each, and
---
these Arabella
 suggested another; and
---
Arabella kept very considerably
 in the rear of Jude; but
---
though she only sipped
---
, she
 took as much as she could safely take without losing her head--.


---
as the crimson upon her countenance showed
---
a thing continually, she replied,"!" 
---
But I do very much
---
; whereupon Arabella put her
 arm round his waist, and
---
she said:". 
---
I do n't know
---
I expect,."


---
I do n't know
---
"-- I do n't know."


---
I tell you,
 Jude,. 
---
Come round to my father's-- I made it up
 with him a bit to- day. 
---
I can let you in, and."


---
Sue to understand such things
---
And she's gone-- and
---
And yet she did it for
 conscience' sake, poor little Sue!"


---
she was right
---
she softly unfastened the
 door,.


---
though
 she did
---
"," she said. 
---
when she had fastened up
 the door
---
She pulled off his boots. 
---
" Now," she whispered,". 
---
VII


 Arabella was preparing breakfast in the downstairs back room of this
 small, recently hired tenement of her father's. 
---
She put her head
 into the little pork- shop in front, and.

---
She looked deedily into his face.

---
" to be up there" said Donn,.


---
I'd have had a new one."


---
while I was about it
---
And Arabella was suddenly seized with
 a fit of loud laughter,.


---
I'll do the rest
---
" Be civil to him, and," she said. 
---
when she had

---
I'll pay back to you again.

---
But I must go up and."


---
Arabella ascended the stairs,. 
---
that her shorn Samson was asleep

---
Finding she entered to the bedside and. 
---
Her ardent gaze seemed
---
said she. 
---
oh yes, I remember! 
---
I am
 stranded-- ill--! 
---
what I am
---
I'll tell them at
 the stoneworks."


---
" I wonder!"


---
" I'll go round and. 
---
Arabella took his purse,.


---
putting on her
 outdoor things went off to the lodgings she and he had quitted the
 evening before
---
ere she reappeared round the
 corner,
---
which she had taken to the lodging for her short sojourn there
---
I know his
 nature, and
---
I shall be left in the lurch. 
---
; for I must have that ready at hand,
---
as she expressed it--
---
suggested by her
---
Donn had only just opened his miserable little pork and sausage
 shop, which had as yet scarce any customers;. 
---
Arabella took him at his word so far as the men went, but.


---
" Yes!" cried Arabella,. 
---
that she was sitting beside Jude
---
" to arrive to
 tell the truth," she continued bashfully, and. 
---
what she was announcing, or
 indeed to anything
---
till Arabella
 whispered to her father
---
Now, old darling," she said to Jude. 
---
When did I promise anything
---
whom she had made so tipsy
 by her special knowledge of that line of business
---
" Why!" said Arabella,. 
---
I do n't remember it
---
" There's only one
 woman-- but
---
Arabella looked towards her father. "
---
" Keep your figures for your debts to friends," said
 Donn.


---
If I am bound in honour--
---
as I suppose
---
I am-- though
 how I came to be here with her
---
I know no more than a dead man
---
I will, so help me God
---
I have never behaved dishonourably to
 a woman or to any living thing. 
---
I am not a man who wants to save
 himself at the expense of the weaker among us!"


---
she, putting her cheek against
 Jude's
---
Arabella, too, had hastily arranged herself,
 and
---
accompanied by Donn away
---
" Do n't go," she said to the guests at parting. 
---
" I've told the little
 maid; and
---
When Arabella, Jude, and Donn had disappeared on their matrimonial
 errand
---
I do n't wish
---
" She's got. 
---
her say so to her
 father
---
Take her all together, limb by limb, she's not such a bad- looking
 piece
---
But for a woman, she's passable enough. 
---
Their eyes followed the movements of the little girl. 
---
as she spread
 the breakfast- cloth on the table they had been using, without wiping
 up the slops of the liquor
---
but I like a woman that a puff o' wind wo n't
 blow down."

 I think!"

" No," said Uncle Joe,. 
---
her
 face was enough to show that her strategy had succeeded.

"
---
The Church do n't recognize divorce in her
 dogma,
---
She said. 
---
I ought and
---
I have straightway
---
" I've got a bargain for my trouble in marrying thee over
 again!"
---
Arabella was saying to him. 
---
" I shall have
---
I shall have, I'd no business to be saddled with at all. 
---
" I have been thinking of
 my foolish feeling about the pig you and I killed during our
 first marriage. 
---
I feel now."


---
as I served
 that animal
---
Arabella kiss Jude one evening when she had taken a
 little cordial
---
her one night haranguing Jude in rattling terms,
 and
---
She asked
 him indifferently.

"
---
me to write to her for
---
how she is,
---
if she'll come,,
 and
---
because I'm ill
---
like you to insult a lawful wife by asking such a thing
---
that I ask you
---
I love Sue. 
---
I do n't wish
---
to mince the matter-- there stands the
 fact: I love her. 
---
I could find a dozen ways of sending a letter to
 her without your knowledge. 
---
But I wish and with her husband. 
---
A message through you asking her to come
 is at least free from any odour of intrigue. 
---
If she retains any of
 her old nature at all
---
, she'll come."


---
" I should think NOT!"


---
HER to know
---
She do n't want. 
---
She's the rat that forsook the sinking ship!"


---
" And I stuck to un-- the more fool I! 
---
before Arabella knew
---
where she was
---
I'll kill
 you-- here and now! 
---
I've. 
---
" gasped Arabella.


---
" Promise never to speak of her."

"
---
I do."


---
I take your word
---
she estimated his life with an
 appraiser's eye. 
---
Arabella murmured,"."


---
if you'll agree to my being in the room with you
 all the time she's here
---
if she had written
---
" Yes," she said;". 
---
I wrote a note
---
I haven't posted it yet."


---
if she really did post it
---
She did not come; but
---
no Sue appeared;
---
that Arabella had never posted hers,
---
although she had written
 it
---
There was something in her manner which told it. 
---
Arabella, like some other nurses, thought.


---
when, after an absence of
 two hours, she came into the room
---
One midday, she beheld the chair empty.


---
Down she flopped on the bed, and
---
" she said.


---
Yet a conviction
 possessed Arabella. 
---
when she had searched the house
---
", let!"
 she said. 
---
" I can do no more."


---
if she will
 be kind enough
---
" Oh-- I did n't think! 
---
I didn't-- Oh, Jude!" 
---
she quickly recovered and.


---
I thought
. 
---
And I shall
 never come again. 
---
I'll stay
---
"-- I wo n't be unkind!"
---
she said,. 
---
her mouth quivering and
---
her
 tears flowing
---
as she allowed
---
She has
 never been other than yours, Jude-- in a proper sense. 
---
, it is
 this meretricious contract with Arabella which has been called doing
 the right thing! 
---
" Do n't make-- I ca n't bear much! 
---
But on this
 point I am decided."


---
" I can not understand
---
-- I can not
---
I-- I've wrestled
 and. 
---
I have nearly brought my body
 into complete subjection. 
---
I would argue with you. 
---
if I
 did n't know
---
that a woman in your state of feeling is quite beyond all
 appeals to her brains
---
that you are humbugging yourself, as
 so many women do about these things; and
---
I WOULD have died game!"


---
She turned
 off quickly.


---
" I will. 
---
I would never come. 
---
even if I had the
 strength to come, which I shall not have any more
---
Her bosom began. 
---
" I ca n't endure you!"

---
she burst out, and
---
, she turned back
 impulsively. "
---
I am not a coward and a contemptible humbug
---
-- I
 ca n't bear it
---
She rushed up to him and,
---
with her mouth on his,
 continued:" I must tell you-- oh I must-- my darling Love! 
---
I mean
---
since I came back to him
---
The words struck her like a blow, and
---
she bent her head. 
---
she gasped presently. 
---
She ran up the church to the east end, and
---
as she requested
---
which she had not
 seen
---
she
 heard, and
---
in a last
 instinct of human affection, even now unsubdued by her fetters
---
, she
 sprang up. 
---
But she knelt down again, and
.


---
which still contained
 Sue
---
IX


 On the platform stood Arabella. 
---
She looked him up and down.


---
" to see her?" she asked.


---
I have
---
"," said she. 
---
" I do n't
 know."


---
" Of course I do. 
---
I meant."


---
" Well, I'm blest! 
---
I could
 not resent your conduct. 
---
But I am not so weak in another way. 
---
I made up my mind. 
---
a fellow, to see a particular woman, and
---
That I've done. 
---
I have seen her for the last time, and
!"

"
---
I've finished myself--
---
I see, in a way
---
when I first walked here
---
" I seem and
---
But I do n't
 revere all of them. 
---
as I did then
---
I do n't believe in half of them.

---
" Oh-- I was talking to myself! 
---
I never saw the streets
 emptier."


---
" I do n't want! 
---
to know their names, I tell you! 
---
What do I care about
 folk dead and? 
---
I must rest a moment
---
which she often did now before bedtime
---
Sue was muddling helplessly in the kitchen,, and.


---
for she was not a good
 housewife,
---
though she tried
---
before I break down" I do n't think.  No woman ought."


---
when Mrs. Edlin put on her bonnet and shawl
---
Half an hour later to
 leave, Sue seemed.


---
I will drink my cup to the dregs!"

," she implored,.


---
her eyes enlarged, and

---
She then fastened up the doors, and
---
whether I be there or no Wait here, Mrs. Edlin," said Sue. 
---
Leaving the widow on the landing Sue turned to the chamber. 
---
She then arose,
 and. 
---
She
 wished Mrs. Edlin good- night, and
---
the widow entered the room that Sue
 had just vacated.


---
again she half opened
 the door, and
---
As the word came out of her mouth
---
she
 visibly shuddered.


---
Sue seemed relieved, and. 
---
" I'll go into my old room a
 moment by myself."

"?" she asked.


---
" I be old and slow,
 and
---
I han't unlaced my jumps
 yet."


---
" I-- don't hear him! 
---
she gasped. 
---
" And then-- I should be FREE, and
---
I
 could go to Jude!... 
---
Ah-- no-- I forgot HER-- and God!"


---
Sue had dragged herself back. "
---
I am
 sorry
---
I called you out." 
---
when she was
 alone
---
I must do it
---
"-- I must! 
---
I must drink to the dregs!
---
" she
 whispered."
---
She waited a moment, and! 
---
"  She had been intending
---
as a contrite woman always keeps back a little
---
She went on:
---
She swore.

"
---
as she crouched before him in her night- clothes
---
her to lift her up
---
Sue started back.


---
A quick look of
 aversion passed over her face, but.


---
she uttered
 no cry
---
when she said to herself:"
---
Ah-- perhaps I'd better go and
---
that Sue had disappeared
---
I married! 
---
But Arabella saw. 
---
" I'm hanged!" she would say,"!"


---
" I was never really stout enough for the stone trade,
 particularly the fixing. 
---
I think. 
---
But I felt.

---
I could do one thing
---
if I had the opportunity
---
I could accumulate ideas, and. 
---
I wonder?... 
---
I hear. 
---
as I was
---
I do n't know much about it. 
---
"!" said Arabella. 
---
" I should have thought
. 
---
I wish!"
---
" said Arabella
 indignantly. 
---
" Calling a respectable married woman by the name of
 that--"  She remembered herself and
---
when she saw
---
But in the course of time, how very little she had
---
to fear from Sue's rivalry, she had a fit of
 generosity. 
---
" I suppose
---
to see your-- Sue?" she said. 
---
" Well,
 I do n't mind. 
---
You can have her here."


---
" I do n't wish."


---
that I'm ill, or anything
---
She has chosen her course. 
---
Mrs. Edlin came, quite
 on her own account. 
---
Jude's wife, whose feelings as to had reached absolute indifference by
 this time. 
---
how Sue was,
---
what Sue had told him
---
She's begun it
 quite lately-- all of her own free will."


---
When did she begin?
---
she insisted."

"
---
Sue, my Sue fool-- this is almost more than I can
 endure!... 
---
Mrs. Edlin-- don't be frightened at my rambling-- I've
 got to talk to myself lying here so many hours alone-- she was once
 a woman whose intellect was to mine like a star to a benzoline lamp:
 who saw all MY superstitions as cobwebs that she could brush away
 with a word. 
---
her intellect
 broke, and
---
she veered round to darkness. 
---
what she loathes
---
As for
 Sue and me, long ago-- when our minds
 were clear, and our love of truth fearless-- the time was not ripe
 for us! 
---
they met with brought reaction in her
---
The lanky form was that of
 Physician Vilbert, who had been called in by Arabella.


---
since I let out some gossip by accident-- the more to my
 blame I hope."

 I'll go up and. " She's not in at present, but."


---
she'll be here soon
---
Arabella inquired and. 
---
" I'll bring it to you here in the passage," she said. 
---
She brought him a bottle and a glass, and
---
Arabella began. 
---
Laughing again she said:
"
---
I poured your own love- philtre into it,
---
I do
---
", I do! 
---
" Do n't do n't," she whispered,.
---
She let him out of the house, and
---
as she went back
---
she said to
 herself:" Well! 
---
Weak women must provide for a rainy day. 
---
And as I suppose he will soon-- it's well
 to keep chances open. 
---
And I ca n't pick and now. 
---
as I could

---
when I was younger
---
Arabella was at the looking- glass curling
 her hair, which operation she performed by heating an umbrella- stay
 in the flame of a candle and. 
---
she had lighted,
---
When she had finished this
---
, practised a dimple, and
 put on her things, she cast. 
---
Arabella, hatted, gloved, and ready, sat down and.


---
They made her restless, and
---
at last she said to herself:"?"


---
She looked again at Jude,
---
as she
 had done so many times during the late months, and
---
she slipped from the room
---
which moved Arabella
---
She shut the front door, and
 and
---
She entered under the archway of Oldgate College, where
 men were putting up awnings round the quadrangle for a ball in the
 hall that evening. 
---
Arabella walked along the
 gravel paths and under the aged limes. 
---
But finding this place rather
 dull she returned to the streets, and. 
---
When, she moved on.


---
wherein I was born, and
---
" Why died I not from the womb? 
---
Why did I not give up the ghost?
---
when
 I came out of the belly
---
...  For now should I have lain still and
. 
---
I should have slept
---
: then had I been at rest!"_

(" Hurrah!")

_" There the prisoners rest together
---
Meanwhile Arabella, in her journey to discover,
. 
---
She nodded to one workman and another, and.


---
I should not mind
---
" having a spin there with a fellow's arm round my
 waist," she said to one of the men. 
---
" But Lord, I must be getting
 home again
---
When she reached home
---
she was met at the door by Stagg, and one or
 two other of Jude's fellow stoneworkers. 
---
", thank you," said Arabella.


---
I should like
---
" to go," said she. 
---
" I've never seen the boat- racing,
 and
---
I hear
---
How I WISH I
---
" could!"  She looked longingly down the street. "
---
I'll just run up and. 
---
, I believe."


---
; so I can most likely come
---
she entered. 
---
When she reached the bedroom
---
she
 found.


---
"!" she said impatiently. 
---
However, on looking round to the bed she brightened,. 
---
for she saw
,
---
her to start
---
she
 went to the bed. 
---
She touched his fingers
---
She listened at his chest. 
---
After her first appalled sense of, the faint notes
 of a military or other brass band from the river reached her ears;
 and
---
in a provoked tone she exclaimed,"! 
---
she went to the door
---
" Here she is!"
---
," she said
 hurriedly.


---
" Oh, I say-- how jolly! 
---
I'm glad I've come
---
," said Arabella. 
---
beneath which a band in red uniform gave out the
 notes she had already heard in the death- chamber. 
---
While she regarded the lively scene
---
somebody touched
 Arabella in the ribs, and
---
looking round she saw Vilbert.


---
She did not reply. 
---
Vilbert's arm stole round her waist,. 
---
she kept her
 eyes on the river.


---
as if she did not know of the embrace
---
she would have laughed heartily at the horse- play
 that succeeded, if the imprint on her mind's eye of a pale,
 statuesque countenance she had lately gazed upon had not sobered her
 a little.


---
Arabella exclaiming," Dear, dear
---
more and more
 impatiently; for it had just occurred to her mind
---
who, being
 pressed close against her by the throng
---
as she got up
 into the street Arabella hastened on, forbidding the physician to
 accompany her further that day
---
She did not go straight to her
 house; but to the abode of a woman who performed the last necessary
 offices for the poorer dead; where she knocked.


---
"," she said. 
---
Arabella waited a few minutes; and
---
the two women went along,.


---
" I must call at the sexton's about the bell, too
---
," said Arabella.

---
I'll meet you at my door."


---
On one side was Arabella, on the other the
 Widow Edlin. 
---
said she.


---
," said Arabella.


---
murmured the old woman.


---
she
 will come
---
"?" she asked.


---
" I could not say. 
---
She swore."


---
" How is she looking?"


---
when
 you saw her last. 
---
Quite a staid, worn woman now. ' Tis the man-- she
 ca n't stomach un, even now!"


---
I offered, and
---
her know
---
she's found forgiveness
 somewhere
---
She said!

"
---
she had found peace
---
She may swear that on her knees to the holy cross upon her necklace
 till she's hoarse, but!
---
" said Arabella. 
---
She's

---
since she left his arms, and
---
again till
 she's
