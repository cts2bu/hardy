thither, that place lying but one or two miles out of his course.

went out one Saturday afternoon towards the market-place from a curious
feeling that he would like to pass a few minutes on the spot of his

looking at a little way off.

fractional parts of the dancers whenever their gyrations brought them
near the doorway, chiefly in the shape of the skirts of dresses and
streaming curls of hair; together with about three-fifths of the band in
profile, including the restless shadow of a fiddler’s elbow, and the tip
of the bass-viol bow.
