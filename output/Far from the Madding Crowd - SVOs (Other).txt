diverging
 wrinkles appeared round them,
---
when they were pleased
---
when they were neither
---
that any wearer might
 stand in a river all day long and
---
what may be called a small silver clock
---
; in other
 words, it was a watch as to shape and intention, and
 a small clock as to size.
---
, had the peculiarity
 of going either too fast or not at all.
---
The smaller
 of its hands, too, occasionally slipped round on the
 pivot, and
---
though the minutes were told with
 precision
---
thus,, nobody could be quite certain of the hour

---
they belonged to.
---
It may be mentioned.

---
that, the watch
 was as a necessity pulled out by throwing the body to
 one side,
---
that many of the hues and
 curves of youth had tarried on to manhood
---
This may be said.

---
The field sloped to a
 ridge called Norcombe Hill.
---
drawn by two horses, a waggoner
---
The waggon was
 laden with household goods and window plants, and
 on the apex of the whole.
---
" The tailboard of the waggon is gone, Miss."
---
said the
 waggoner.

---
it fall
---
The sensible horses stood-- perfectly still, and
---
the
 waggoner's steps sank fainter and fainter in the distance.

---
surrounded by tables and chairs with their legs upwards
---
backed by an oak settle, and
---
ornamented in front by
 pots of geraniums, myrtles, and cactuses, together with
 a caged canary-- all probably from the windows of the
 house
---
the only sound heard in the stillness
---
was the
 hopping of the canary up- and down the perches of its
 prison.
---
It
 was not at the bird, nor
---
at the cat; it was at an oblong
 package tied in paper, and.
---
if the waggoner were coming
---
what
 was inside it
---
untied the paper covering; a small swing
 looking- glass was disclosed,.
---
It was a fine morning, and
---
were fresh and green, and
---
at such a leafless season they
 invested the whole concern of horses, waggon, furniture,
 and girl with a peculiar vernal charm.
---
What possessed
 her,--
---
who were
 alone its spectators
---
whether the smile began as a
 factitious one,,
---
-- nobody
 knows
---
; it ended certainly in a real smile.
---
The change from the customary spot and necessary
 occasion of such an act-- from the dressing hour in a
 bedroom to a time of travelling out of doors-- lent to
 the idle deed a novelty it did not intrinsically possess.

---
The picture was a delicate one.
---
the smiles being of a phase suggesting that
 hearts were imagined as lost and won
---
Still, this was
 but conjecture, and the whole series of actions was so
 idly put forth as to make it rash to assert that intention
 had any part in them at all.

---
The waggoner's steps were heard.
---
When the waggon had passed on
---
lt was a difference con-

---
" Mis'ess's niece is upon the top of the things, and

---
that's enough that I've offered ye, you great

---
These were the
 waggoner's words.

---
" Very well; then mis'ess's niece ca n't pass..

---
" said the
 turnpike- keeper, closing the gate
---
There was something in the
 tone of twopence remarkably insignificant.
---
Threepence
 had a definite value as money
---
-- it was an appreciable
 infringement on a day's wages, and, as such, a higgling
 matter; but twopence--" Here."
---
that not a single
 lineament could be selected and
---
we know.

---
The gatekeeper surveyed the retreating vehicle.

---
" And the greatest of them is--."

---
well, what it is
 always
---
piqued by the comely
 traveller's indifference
---
IT was nearly midnight on the eve of St. Thomas's, the
 shortest day in the year.
---
Norcombe Hill-- not far from lonely Toller- Down
 -- was one of the spots which suggest to a passer- by
.

---
It was a featureless convexity of chalk and soil-- an
 ordinary specimen of those smoothly- outlined protuber-
 ances of the globe which may remain undisturbed on
 some great day of confusion, when far grander heights
 and dizzy granite precipices topple down.

---
The hill was covered on its northern side by an
 ancient and decaying plantation of beeches,.
---
whose
 upper verge formed a line over the crest,
---
To- night
 these trees sheltered the southern slope from the keenest
 blasts, which smote the wood and floundered through
 it with a sound as of grumbling, or gushed over its
 crowning boughs in a weakened moan.
---
The dry leaves
 in the ditch simmered and
---
boiled in the same breezes,
 a tongue of air occasionally ferreting out a few, and
.
---
A group or
 two of the latest in date amongst the dead multitude
 had remained till this very mid- winter time on the twigs
 which bore them and in falling rattled against the trunks
 with smart taps:
 Between this half- wooded, half naked hill, and the
 vague still horizon that its summit indistinctly com-

---
that what it con-
 cealed
---
The thin grasses, more or less coating the hill, were
 touched by the wind in breezes of differing powers, and
 almost of differing natures-- one rubbing the blades
 heavily, another raking them piercingly, another brushing

---
The instinctive act of human-
 kind was, and and

---
how hedges and other shapes to leeward them
 caught the note,
---
how the trees
 to each other in the regular antiphonies of a cathedral
 choir; lowering it to the tenderest sob
---
how the hurrying gust then plunged into the south, to
.

---
The sky was clear-- remarkably clear-- and
---
the
 twinkling of all the stars seemed but throbs of
 one body,.
---
timed by a common pulse
---
The North Star
 was directly in the wind's eye, and
---
since evening the
 Bear had swung round it outwardly to the east,.
---
A
 difference of colour in the stars-- oftener read of than
 seen in England- was really perceptible here.
---
The
 sovereign brilliancy of Sirius pierced the eye with a steely
 glitter,.

---
the star called Capella was yellow, Aldebaran and
 Betelgueux
---
To persons standing alone on a hill during a clear
 midnight such as this, the roll of the world eastward is
 almost a palpable movement.
---
The sensation may be
 caused by the panoramic glide of the stars past earthly
 objects, which is perceptible in a few minutes of still-
 ness, or by the better outlook upon space that a hill
 affords, or by the wind, or by the solitude; but
---
whatever
 be its origin
---
, the impression of riding along is vivid and
 abiding.
---
The poetry of motion is a phrase much in
 use, and to enjoy the epic form of that gratification it
.
---
who are
 dreamwrapt and disregardful of all such proceedings at

---
After such a nocturnal reconnoitre
 it is hard, and.

---
that the
 consciousness of such majestic speeding is derived from
 a tiny human frame
---
Suddenly an unexpected series of sounds began to
.
---
They had a
 clearness which was to be found nowhere in the wind,
 and a sequence which was to be found nowhere in
 nature.
---
The tune was not floating unhindered into the open
 air
---
:  it seemed muffled in some way, and.
---
It came
 from the direction of a small dark object under the
 plantation hedge-- a shepherd's hut-- now presenting
 an outline to which an uninitiated person might have
 been puzzled to attach either meaning or use.

---
The image as a whole was that of a small Noah's
 Ark on a small Ararat,
---
which are followed by toy-
 makers
---
because earliest im-
 pressions-- to pass as an approximate pattern
---
The
 hut stood on little wheels, which raised its floor about a
 foot from the ground.
---
Such shepherds' huts are dragged
 into the fields.

---
when the lambing season comes on, to
 shelter the shepherd in his- enforced nightly attendance
---
It was only latterly.
---
that people had begun
---
The wind continued, but
---
the flute- playing ceased.
---
though they had a quiet- energy
---
Fitness being the basis of beauty
---
, nobody
 could- have denied Yet,
.

---
if occasion demanded
---
A close examination of the ground hereabout, even
 by the wan starlight only, revealed.
---
how a portion of
 what would have been casually called this winter
---
Detached hurdles thatched with straw
.
---
The ring of the sheep- bell,
, recommenced,
 in tones that had more mellowness than clearness,.
---
This
 continued.
---
united by a seemingly inconsiderable mem-

---
which constituted the animal's entire body just at present
---
, the cot being lighted
 by a candle suspended by a twisted wire
---
as it now presented itself,
---
The inside of the hut, was
 cosy and alluring, and the scarlet handful of fire in
 addition to the candle, reflecting its own genial colour
 upon whatever it could reach, flung associations of
 enjoyment even over utensils and tools.
---
spirits of
 wine, turpentine, tar, magnesia, ginger, and castor- oil
 being the chief
---
which was supplied from a flagon beneath
---
Beside the
 provisions lay the flute whose notes had lately been
 called forth by the lonely watcher to beguile a tedious
 hour.
---
The house was ventilated by two round holes,
 like the lights of a ship's cabin, with wood slides-

---
revived by the warmth
---
The lamb, began,.
---
as expected sounds will
---
that had accompanied the reverse
 operation
---
that the hour-
 hand had shifted again,
---
The Dog- star and Aldebaran, pointing to the restless
 Pleiades, were half- way up the Southern sky, and between
.
---
them hung Orion, which gorgeous constellation never
 burnt more vividly than now, as it soared forth above
 the rim of the landscape
---
Human shapes, interferences,
 troubles, and joys were all, and
---
as if they were not
---
with eyes stretched afar
---
that to be a star low
 was in reality no
 such thing
---
It was an artificial light, almost close at hand.
 
---
where company
 is desirable and
---
To find themselves utterly alone at night expected makes some people fearful; but
---
a
 case more trying by far to the nerves is.
 
---
when intuition, sensation, memory,
 analogy, testimony, probability, induction-- every kind of
 evidence in the logician's list-- have united
---
that it is quite in isolation
---
that a shed occupied a place here,

---
the site being a cutting into the slope of the hill,
---
so that at
 its back part the roof was almost level with the ground
---
In
 front it was formed of board.
---
By the side
 of the latter a steaming bran- mash stood in a bucket.
---
as Milton's Satan first saw
 Paradise
---
There, now we'll go home
---
"," said the elder of the two,.
---
Daisy will fetch round again now
---
whose eyelids were apparently
---
As we are not

.
---
" for you must help me
---
if you stay
---
Well, my hat is gone
---
", however," continued the younger.
---
It
 went over the hedge
---
" It
 went over the hedge, I think. The idea of such a slight wind
 catching it."
 
---
The cow standing erect was of the Devon breed, and.

---
as if the animal had been dipped in

---
The other was spotted, grey and white.
---
which showed
---
that it had not long been
 accustomed to the phenomenon of eyesight, and often turn-
 ing to the lantern, which it apparently mistook for the moon
---
Between the sheep and the cows Lucina had
 been busy on Norcombe hill lately.
 
---
we had better send for some oatmeal
---
" But there's no side- saddle."

---
we colour and mould
---
whatever our eyes bring in
---
the light sinking down
 the hill
---
till it was no more than a nebula
---
Even its position
 terrestrially is one of the elements of a new interest,
 and
---
that the incident of
 the night had occurred there
---
It was not a bridle- path-- merely a
 pedestrian's track, and
---
the boughs spread horizontally
 at a height not greater than seven feet above the ground,
.

---
which made it impossible to ride erect beneath them
---
who wore no riding- habit
---
that all humanity was
 out of view
---
The tall lank
 pony seemed, and.
---
The performer seemed quite at home anywhere
 between a horse's head and its tail, and the necessity
 for this abnormal attitude having ceased with the
 passage of the plantation
---
it was very apparent
---
that nobody was in sight
---
Soon soft shirts alternating with loud shirts came
 in regular succession from within the shed, the obvious
 sounds of a person milking a cow.
---
this rather saucy assumption failed in being offensive,
.

---
because a beholder felt
---
it to be, upon the whole, true
---
which would have made mediocrity ridiculous
---
Like exceptional emphasis in the tone of a genius, that
 was an
 addition to recognised power.
---
It was with some
 surprise.

---
selected by the judgment
---
The
 starting- point was.
---
the pail was a small one, and the
 hedge diminutive; hence, making allowance for error
 by comparison with these.
---
All
 features of consequence were severe and regular.
---
It
 may have been observed by persons who go about the
 shires with eyes for beauty,
---
that in Englishwoman a
 classically- formed face is seldom found
---
the highly- finished
 features being generally too large for the remainder of
 the frame
---
to be united
 with a figure of the same pattern,; that a graceful and proportionate figure of
 eight heads usually goes off into random facial curves.

---
it be said
---
that here criticism checked itself as out
 of place, and
---
than they do it in towns
---
The self-
 consciousness shown would have been vanity if a little
 more pronounced, dignity if a little less.
---
Rays of male
 vision seem
---
" I found a hat."" It is mine."
---
from a sense of proportion,
 kept down to a small smile an inclination to laugh dis-
 tinctly: " it flew away last night.
---
" Well-- it was."
---
" How did you know?"

---
are you not?"

---
which was black in the
 shaded hollows of its mass
---
it being now an hour
 past sunrise
---
, the rays touched its prominent curves with
 a colour of their own.

---
( In speaking
 of farms the word" acres" is omitted by the natives, by
 analogy to such old expressions as" a stag of ten.")

---
" Yes you had."

---
" How do you know?"

---
A perception caused.
---
Recollection of the strange antics indulged in,
---
what seemed

---
Five mornings and evenings passed.
---
For, as without law there is no sin, without
 eyes; and
---
there is no indecorum
---
The acquaintanceship might, however, have ended in
 a slow forgetting, but for an incident which occurred at
 the end of the same week.
---
One afternoon it began to
 freeze, and the frost increased with evening, which drew
 on like a stealthy tightening of bonds.
---
It was a time
 when in cottages the breath of the sleepers freezes to
 the sheets
---
; when round the drawing- room fire of a
 thick- walled mansion the sitters' backs are cold,.
---
even
 whilst their faces are all aglow
---
Many a small bird went
 to bed supperless that night among the bare boughs.

---
As the milking- hour drew near
---
The wind came in at the bottom of the door,
 and.
---
of which there was one
 on each side of the hut
---
when the fire was
 lighted and
---
the door closed
---
that one of these must be kept
 open--
---
that chosen
---
till the temperature of the
 hut was
---
that evening had sunk

---
Whatever is the matter
---
since you are not
 dead
---
It is a wonder you were not, suffocated in this
 hut of yours
---
as they did in old times
---
It played me nearly the
 same trick the other day!"
---
It was not exactly the fault of the hut."
---
which showed
---
" You
 have considered, and."

---
" How did you find me?"

---
your dog howling and
---
( it was so
 lucky,
---
Daisy's milking is almost over for the season, and
 
---
The
 dog saw me, and.
---
if the slides were closed
---
there you were like
 dead.
---
as there was no
 water
---
it was warm,
---
that should harmonise with the dignity of
 such a deed
---
you saved my life, Miss-- 
---
There
 is no reason either why I should,."
---
as you probably will
 never have much to do with me
---
" And mine is n't.
---
You see
---
", it is the only one I shall ever have, and
---
mine sounds odd and disagreeable
---
you might soon get a new one
---
how many opinions you keep about you
."

---
you
 would like them
---
" You may have it again
---
if you like
---
; there it is."

---
How soft it is--
---
" There-- that's long enough.
---
you are thinking

---
you would like
---
You may."

---
if you want to

you wo n't

that is tolerable to the
 rival sex

Love, being an extremely exacting usurer( a sense of
 exorbitant profit, spiritually, by an exchange of hearts,
 being at the bottom of pure passions, as that of exorbi-
 tant profit, bodily or materially, is at the bottom of
 those of lower atmosphere),.
---
that the farmer was quite struck with the
 resemblance
---
it lowering

which end

where they begin

that the cow would go
 dry in about seven days

The cow had ceased

Marriage
 transforms a distraction into a support, the power of
 which should be, and happily often is, in direct pro-
 portion to the degree of imbecility it supplants.

which had a
 summer face and a winter constitution
---
when there was just enough blue sky visible to
, and
---
cheerfully- disposed people wish for more

Nothing disturbed the stillness of the cottage might fancy scandal and rumour to be no less the
 staple topic of these little coteries on roofs than of
 those under them.
---
It seemed
---
The dog took no notice,
---
A voice came from behind some laurel- bushes into
:
" Poor dear!
---
which the cat had run
---
George was walking on behind me with a temper as
 mild as milk."

---
Nobody appeared, and
---
Where the issue of an interview is as likely
 to be a vast change for the worse as for the better,
 any initial difference from expectation.
---
( Calling one's self merely Some-
 body, without giving a name, is an example of the ill- breeding of the rural world: it
 springs from a refined modesty, of which townspeople,
 with their cards and announcements,.)

---
The voice had evidently been
 hers.

---
" Will you come in, Mr. Oak?"

---
If you will wait a minute
---
The
 lamb is n't really the business I came about, Mrs. Hurst.

---
" And were you indeed?"
"
---
D'ye know?"

---
me think
---
" Let," said Mrs. Hurst,....
---
You see, Farmer Oak,
---
you know
---
" That's unfortunate."
---
my only chance was in being
 the first comer...
---
, Well, there's no use in my waiting
---
in which the exclamation usually embodies itself
---
the runner drew nearer.
---
hers
 was already deep, not,, from emotion,
 but from running
---
as it appeared
---
before the sun dries off the dew
---
" you had come, or
---
after you to say
---
till you've found your
 breath
---
that,, it was such a pity to send
 you away
---
" Yes; you have."

---
still, it will soon be paid off and."
---
that it was the complacent form of" a great deal

e continued: "."
 
---
When we be married
---
" What to tell you was only this.
---
that nobody has
 got me yet as a sweetheart, instead of my having a
 dozen,
---
But there was no harm in' hurrying to correct
 a piece of false news that had been told you."

---
But there is such a thing
 as being too generous in expressing a judgment impuls-
 ively, and
---
it was no harm
---
for you'd have been

---
Will
 you marry me?
---
";"; my mind spreads
 away so."

---
" But you can give a guess."

---
You shall have as piano in a
 year or two

because they be useful

when the wedding was over

" And, we'd have."

---
that holly seemed in
 his
---
after life to be a cypher signifying a proposal of
 marriage
---
People would talk about me, and and
---
as you say
---
"-- I, that is."

---
" Well, is,.
---
" That's a terrible wooden story."

---
being like the sigh of a pine plantation,
 it was rather noticeable as a disturbance of the atmo-
 sphere.
---
" Why wo n't you have me?"
---
so that it was hardly ill- mannered at all
---
that's very fine!
---
You'd get."

---
" It seems dreadfully wrong!"
---
when
 you feel so much

" It would n't do, Mr Oak.
---
somebody to tame me
---
you would never be able to, I know."

---
with luminous distinctness and
 common sense," you are better off than I.
---
: that's my side
 of the case.
---
Now yours: you are a farmer just begin-

---
you ought in common prudence,.

---
if you marry
 at all()

which you should certainly not think of doing
 at present
---
" That's the very thing I had been thinking myself!"

decidedly disconcerted,
" Well, then, did you come and?"

---
what would be

" You have made an admission now, Mr. Oak.

After that, do you think?

That about me is nonsense.

You speak like a lady--

 notice it, and

will you walk along
 with me o'

you to make- up
 your mind
---
It may have been observed.

---
that there is no regula
 path for getting out of love as there is for getting in
---
Some people look upon marriage as a short cut that way,
 but
---
it has been known.

which was

that chance is apt to idealise the removed object
 with others-- notably those whose affection, placid and
 regular as it may be flows deep and long

George, the elder, exhibited
 an ebony- tipped nose, surrounded by a narrow margin
 of pink flesh, and a coat marked in random splotches
; but
---
the
 grey, after years of sun and rain, had been scorched and
.
---
as if the blue component of the grey
 had faded
---
In substance it had originally been
 hair, but long contact with sheep
---
This dog had originally belonged to a shepherd of
 inferior morals and dreadful temper, and
---
the result was
.

---
Long experience had so precisely taught the animal the
 difference between such exclamations as" Come in!"

---
and" D-- --  ye, come in!"
---
The young dog, George's son, might possibly have
.
---
when the other should die
---
from which chalk had
 been drawn for generations, and
---
Two hedges converged upon it in the form of
 a V, but without quite meeting.
---
which was immediately over the brow of the pit
---
The narrow opening
 left,,
 was protected by a rough railing.

---
Only one responded-- old George; the
 other- could not be found, either in the house, lane, or
 garden.
---
It was a still, moist night.

that only makes

itself noticed by ceasing
 ever distant

To the shepherd, the note of the sheep"
 chronic sound, that all is well in the fold.

In the solemn
 This exceptional ringing may be caused in two ways--
 by the rapid feeding of the sheep bearing the bell, as
.
---
when the flock breaks into new pasture, which gives it
 an intermittent rapidity, or by the sheep starting off in
 a run, when the sound has a regular palpitation
---
The
 forward ewes were kept apart from those among which
 the fall of lambs would be later,.
---
These two hundred
 seemed.
---
them break fence at this season, yet
---
of which a great deal grew in the plantation
---
They were not in the plantation.

of which
 we have spoken

where the ends of the two converging hedges were stopped short by meeting the brow
 of the chalk- pit
---
the younger dog standing against
 the sky-- dark and motionless as Napoleon at St.
 Helena
---
The dog came up,.
---
The ewes lay dead and.

---
that a day came and

---
It was a second.
---
The sheep were not insured.
---
All the savings
 of a frugal life had been dispersed at a blow
---
that no more seemed
---
Stupors, however, do not last for ever, and
---
over it hung the
 attenuated skeleton of a chrome- yellow moon which
 had only a few days to last--.
---
As far as could be learnt it appeared, and
---
which may have given him additional energy
 and spirits
---
which
 so often attends dogs and other philosophers who
 follow out a train of reasoning to its logical conclusion,
 and
---
-- another instance of the untoward fate attempt perfectly consistent conduct in a world
 made up so largely of compromise.

---
We are brought on to a
 day in February, on which was held the yearly statute
 or hiring fair in the county- town of Casterbridge.

---
to whom labour suggests nothing
 worse than a wrestle with gravitation, and pleasure
 nothing better than a renunciation of the same among
 these,
---
having a piece of whip- cord twisted round their hats;
 thatchers wore a fragment of woven straw; shepherds
 held their sheep- crooks in their hands; and thus the
 situation required was known to the hirers at a
 glance.

---
who wants one
---
than it had taken away
---
And thus the abasement had been exaltation, and the
 loss gain.

---
In the morning a regiment of cavalry had left the
 town, and
---
As the end of the
 day drew on, and
---
All the farmers seemed.

---
I am not married" I am looking for a place myself-- a bailiff's." How long would it take you?"

---
the crook was made,.

---
the
 owner of which had a large rural connection
---
This transaction having been completed
---
Now, it
 seemed.
---
that bailifs were most in demand
---
Dialogues
 followed, more or lessin?"

---
Where do you come from
---
" That's a long way.

---
" Who's farm were you upon last?"

---
This reply invariably operated like a rumour of
 cholera.
---
The inquiring farmer would edge away and

---
It is safer, and

---
that offers itself
---
that was required in the fair
---
It
 grew dusk.
---
who had never known
 moment's sorrow
---
that there was another
 fair at Shottsford the next day
---
" How far is Shottsford?"

---
It was.
---
This information was like coming
 from night into noon.

---
" How far is it to Weatherbury?"

---
the place had,.
---
because it lay in the Weatherbury
 quarter
---
Moreover, the Weatherbury folk were by no
 means uninteresting intrinsically.
---
If report spoke truly

---

 any in the whole county.

The road stretched through water- meadows traversed
 by little brooks, whose quivering surfaces were braided
 along their centres, and folded into creases at the sides;
 or,
---
where the flow was more rapid
---
, the stream was.
---
which rode on in undisturbed
 serenity
---
as they bowled along helter-

---
On the higher levels the dead and dry carcasses
 of leaves tapped the ground skelter upon the shoulders of the wind, and little birds
 in the hedges were rustling their feathers and tucking
 themselves in comfortably for the night,.
---
where the game- birds were rising to their roosts, and

---
three or four miles every
 shape in the- landscape had assumed a uniform hue of
 blackness
---
there were no horses
 attached to it, the spot being apparently quite deserted

The waggon, from its position, seemed

to have been left
 there for the night, for beyond about half a truss  of hay
, it was quite empty.

 was in motion

, and

Charles's
 Wain was getting towards a right angle with the Pole
 star, and
---
that it must be about nine
 o'clock-- in other words
---
This small astronomical calculation was made without
 any positive effort, and
---
Two figures were dimly visible in front,.

---
one of whom was driving
---
that this was the waggoner
---
it
 appeared.

---
they had come from Casterbridge fair, like
 himself
---
A conversation was in progress, which continued
 thus: --

---
these dandy cattle be as- proud as a lucifer
 in their insides.
---
-- so' a do seem,
---
" Ay Billy Smallbury-- so' a do seem."

---
This utterance was very shaky by nature, and
---
more so
 by circumstance, the jolting of the waggon not being-
 without its effect upon the speaker's larynx.
---
"-- so' tis said here and
 there.
---
If so be' tis like that
---
Tis said."

---
" And' a can play the peanner
---
, so' tis said.
---
" D'ye tell o't!
---
There were, however, no
 ground for retaining such a supposition, for the waggon,

---
They were now apparently
 close upon Weatherbury and not to alarm the speakers
 unnecessarily
---
the glow increased.
---
Something was on fire.

---
A rick- yard was the source of the fire.

---
It seemed.

---
as if the spot was

---
unoccupied by a living soul
---
The fire was issuing from a long straw- stack, which
 was so far gone as to preclude a possibility of saving it.

---
As the wind
 blows the fire inwards, the portion in flames completely
 disappears like melting sugar, and
---
the outline is lost
 to the eye.
---
However, a hay or a wheat- rick, well put
 together,.

---
if
 it begins on the outside
---
rick of straw, loosely
 put together, and
---
the flames darted into it with lightning
 swiftness.
---
It glowed on the windward side,, like the coal of a cigar.
---
Then a
 superincumbent bundle rolled down, with a whisking
 noise
---
; flames elongated, and but no crackle.
---
Banks of smoke
 went off horizontally at the back like passing clouds,
 and.
---
Individual straws in the foreground were
 consumed in a creeping movement of ruddy heat, as
 if they were knots of red worms, and above shone
 imaginary fiery faces
---
from which at intervals
 sparks flew in clusters like birds from a nest,

---
bad
 servant is fire, fire!
---
which casts its thoughts into the form of feeling
---
The corn stood on
 stone staddles, and
---
between these, tongues of yellow
 hue from the burning straw licked and.

---
If the fire once got under this stack

, all would be

---
A rick- cloth was brought, and
---
they hung it like a
 curtain across the channel.

The flames immediately
 ceased, and

---
The flames, now driven upwards, began.

 clear voice.

 the meeting, or

 quietly.

Will you come to the house?"

" We could knock in a bit and a drop a good deal
 freer, Miss,,"

ye'd send it to Warren's Malthouse

if so be replied the spokesman.

---
" And now." said the bailiff, finally,
---
" all is settled and

, I
 think, about your coming, I am going home- along.
" Can you get me a lodging?

If you follow on the road till

 gone to have their snap of victuals

The bailiff, went up the hill, and

where several ancient trees grew

There was a wide margin of grass along here, and

The noise
 was enough to disturb the motionless stranger, who
 started and assumed a careless position.

---
The voice was unexpectedly attractive

; it was" the
 low and dulcet note suggestive of romance," common in
 descriptions, rare in experience.

---
It's at the bottom of the hill.

Do you know?"

how late they keep open

 about it

will you-- at least, not for a day or two?"

the other replied."I am
 rather poor, and

 about me

" You ought

Would you mind?

---
Since
 you are not very well off

, perhaps you would accept this
 trifle from me

It is only a shilling, but

it is all I have
."

---
said the stranger, gratefully.

---
before the money could
 be passed
---
In feeling for
 each other's palm in the gloom, a minute incident occurred.

---
which told much

It was beating with a throb of tragic intensity.

" What is the matter?"

" But there is?"

NEWS


 WARREN'S Malthouse was enclosed by an old wall
 inwrapped with ivy, and
---
though not much of the exterior
 was visible at this hour
---
, the character and purposes of
 the building were clearly enough shown by its outline
 upon the sky.
---
From the walls an overhanging thatched
 roof sloped up to a point in the centre, upon which rose
 a small wooden lantern, fitted with louvre- boards on all
 the four sides, and from these openings.
---
a mist was
---
There was
 no window in front; but
---
a square hole in the door was
.

---
through which red, comfortable
 rays now stretched out upon the ivied wall in front
---
Voices were.

---
This lifted
 a wooden latch, and
---
the door swung open.

---
The room inside was lighted only by the, ruddy glow
 from the kiln mouth, which shone over, the floor with
 the streaming, horizontality of the setting sun, and threw
 upwards the shadows of all facial irregularities in those
 assembled around.
---
The stone- flag floor was worn into
 a path from the doorway to the kiln, and into undula-
 tions everywhere.

the owner and frequent occupier
 of which was the maltster

which seemed

The conversation
( to have been concerning the origin of the
 fire) immediately ceased, and

after this operation had
 been completed

" Very well; I will." We thought, but."

we heard

a hand pawing about the
 door for the bobbin

not a dead
 leaf blowed across

" Come in, shepherd;
 sure, though we do n't know yer name."

---
that's my name, neighbours
---
nobody was supposed

said the shepherd, placidly.

---
as if the momentum previously imparted
 had been sufficient
---
that they were sure
---
-- were n't ye, Jacob?"

---
However, my son
 William must have knowed
---
Billy, afore ye left Norcombe?"

---
" No,' twas Andrew.

" We were talking about this very family, and

 the use- money is gied away to the second- best poor
 folk,

which were vermilion- red and bleared by gazing
 into it for so many years

it was traneous matter about the outside, especially in the
 crevices of the handles

rather furred with ex-
, the innermost curves of which
 may not have seen daylight for several years by reason
 of this encrustation thereon-- formed of ashes accident-
 ally wetted with cider and baked hard; but

It may be observed.

that such a class of mug is

probably because its size makes

if the liquor was
 warm enough

" A clane cup for the shepherd." said the maltster
 commandingly.

what sort it is

when there's so much work to be done in
 the world already

which is

to know was.

The cider will go down

Do n't ye chaw quite close,
 shepherd,.

we all know what that is,

as you say

we see

your teeth quite meet

you wo n't feel
 the sandiness at all.
---
what can be

---
done by contrivance

said the maltster.

Having at this moment reached the end of a wistful
 gaze into mid- air, Henry did not refuse.

if any
 passing schoolmaster ventured

that the second
" e" was superfluous and old- fashioned

to whom orthographical differences were matters which
 had a great deal to do with personal character

who had passed the cup to Henery

" Why, Joseph Poorgrass, ye han't had a drop!"

" Why, ye've hardly had strength of eye enough, so

" Poor feller." said Mr. Clark.

" for we all know ye

And ye have suffered from it a long time

" Oh ay, tried all sorts o' company.
---
They took me
 to Greenhill Fair, and into a great gay jerry- go- nimble
 show, where there were women- folk riding round--
 standing upon horses, with hardly anything on but their
 smocks; but

it did n't cure me a morsel.

Blushes hev been

that a true
 narrative, like time and tide, must run its course and

what's right

; is right, and

-- that's every word I said, and

it
 ended

where it did

The question of which was

right being tacitly waived
 by the company

Ay, another time ye were lost by Lambing- Down Gate,
?"

---
as if there were some
 conditions too serious even for modesty to remember
 itself under
---
this being one
---
Yes; that were the middle of the night, too.
---
The
 gate would not open,
---
there was the Devil's hand in it
---
" My heart died within me, that time; but
---
But no, the gate would n't open; and

if this do n't do it

nothing will

the gate would open

yes, neighbours, the gate opened the same as ever

As I take it" That's about the shape o't,' a b'lieve."

Did ye know' en,

  " Not at all."

" I used. I being a
 respectable young fellow as I liked" Ay, ay, Jan Coggan; we know yer meaning.

" And so you see' twas beautiful ale, and."

And so I used and then by the time I got there I were as dry
 as a lime- basket-- so thorough dry that that ale would
 slip down -- ah,'!

Not a single damn allowed; no,
 not a bare poor one, even at the most cheerful moment
 when all were blindest, though the good old word of
 sin thrown in here and there at such times is a great
 relief to a merry soul."

" True." said the maltster."

unholy exclamations is a necessity of life."

Ay, poor Charlotte, I wonder when' a died!

But' a was never much in luck's way, and And

 difficulty in keeping the conversation in the desired
 channel.

they were townsfolk, and.

They've
 been dead for years.

" I knew them a little."" Well." said the maltster

Their daughter was not at all a pretty chile at that
 time

like, thinking only of religion." said Henery Fray.
---
"' Tis to be hoped.
---
" Well, yes; but the baily will have most to do with
 the business and ourselves.
---
Henery gazed into
 the ashpit, and.
  
---
" said Henery,
---
that irony must cease
 at a certain point
---
" Good faith, you do talk!
---
that comes from a keener appreciation of the miseries
 of life
---
Ah, there's
 people of one sort, and people of another, but
---
sons growed
 mild and ancient
---
" Really one may say."
  
---
" Crooked folk will last a long while."
---
said the maltster,
 grimly, and not in the best humour.
  
---
" Shepherd would like-- would n't ye, shepherd?
  
---
" What may your age be, malter?"
  
---
when the importance of a subject is
---
that any mannerism must be tolerated
 in getting at it
---
" Old Twills
 would n't hire me for more than eleven months at a
 time,.
---
How much is that?"
  
---
who had hitherto sat unobserved in a corner
---
" Well, then, that's my age."
---
said the maltster, em-

---
" Your turnip- hoeing
 were in the summer and your malting in the winter of
 the same years, and
---
ye do n't ought."
  
---
That's my question.
---
ye'll say next
---
" Sure we sha n't. soothingly.
  
---
" Ye be a very old aged person, malter."
---
" True, true; ye must, malter, wonderful," said the
 meeting unanimously.
  
---
While the cup was being examined
---
" You did."
---
careless- like, shepherd and your time will come
 tired?
---
A poor tool, neighbours; but
 ye shall have and welcome."
  
---
who having no individuality worth

---
' tis a true comfort for us to
 have such a shepherd
---
We ought
---
" to feel full o' thanksgiving
; for' twould have been just as easy.
---
Yes, for our wives"
 and daughters' sakes we should feel."
  
---
" for evil do thrive so in these times."
  
---
that ye
 may be,

" said
 Henery Fray,.
---
just as they be now
---
" For by nature ye be a very handsome man,
 shepherd."
---
" Ay, that ye be, shepard."
---
said the company.
  
---
" Ah, when I and my wife were married at Norcombe
 Church." said the old maltster, not pleased at finding

---
" we were called the
 handsomest couple in the neighbourhood--
---
everybody
 said so."
  
---
if ye bain't altered now
---
" Danged, malter." said a voice
 with the vigour natural to the enunciation of a remark-
 ably evident truism.
---
whose offensiveness and spiteful ways were

---
barely atoned for by the occasional chuckle
---
" Do n't ye play no more shepherd
---
when there's tunes

---
that music was still playing
---
" What's yer hurry then, Laban?
---
" You used."
  
---
Well, ye see, neighbours
---
so ye see-- --"

---
as the saying is
---
Henery Fray was the first to follow.
---
who had offered
 him a lodging
---
when the remaining
 ones were on their legs and about to depart
---
A few minutes later,, Fray came
 back again in a hurry.
---
O-- what's the matter
---
, what's the matter, Henery?"

---
" What's a- brewing, Henrey?"
---
-- I said so; yes,
 I said so!"
  " What, found out?"
  
---
" Stealing it is.
---
The news is,
---
all was
 safe,
---
You do
---
of course I speak with closed
 doors?"-- you do, Henery."
  
---
my question is,?"
  
---
who's going to

---
The question was such a profound one that Henery
 was obliged to drink there and then from the large
 cup till the bottom was distinctly visible inside.
---
they replied,.
  
---
They've been wanting, but
---
And they
 do n't know

Maryann d'think the beginning of a crowner's
 inquest
---
" I've had in my left ear quite bad enough for a
 murder, and I've seen a magpie all alone!"
  " O--' tis burned--'
---
tis burned!"
---
" No--' tis drowned!"
---
said Tall.
  
---
suggested Billy Smallbury,
 with a vivid sense of detail.
  
---
before we go to bed
---
They all hastened up the lane to the farmhouse,
.
---
There, as
 the others' footsteps died away.
  
---
Do it quietly; there is
 no reason for alarm as yet.
---
we were all at the fire.
---
" It is hardly likely, either." continued Bathsheba.
"
---
which gives me serious alarm
---
you mean
---
That's true
---
said a female voice from another window,
 which seemed that of Maryann."
---
Hers lives in Casterbridge, and

---
said William Smallbury.
  
---
you go there and.
---
And then there's this disgraceful affair of the bailiff--

---
" Ay, ay, mistress; we will.
---
as I told you" they replied, and.

It is
 rarely, but

that the pleasures of the imagination will compen-

though a limited series, it was

 CHAPTER IX



 THE HOMESTEAD-- A VISITOR-- HALF- CONFIDENCES



---
one has done from a furlong of laden shelves
---
which told at a
 glance
---
that, as is so frequently the case
---
of' a proportion, it had once
 been the memorial hall upon a small estate around it,
.

---
Fluted pilasters, worked from the solid stone,

---
above the roof the chimneys
 were panelled or
---
decorated its front, and columnar, some coped gables with
 finials and.
---
like features still retaining traces of their
 Gothic extraction
---
Soft Brown mosses, like faded
 velveteen, formed cushions upon the stone tiling, and
 tufts of the houseleek or sengreen sprouted from the
 eaves of the low surrounding buildings.
---
A gravel walk
 leading from the door to the road in front was encrusted
 at the sides with more moss--
---
here it was a silver- green
 variety, the nut- brown of the gravel being visible to the
 width of only a foot or two in the centre.
---
This circum-
 stance, and the generally sleepy air of the whole prospect
 here, together with the animated and contrasting state
 of the reverse facade, suggested to the imagination.
---
that
 on the adaptation of the building for farming purposes
 the vital principle' of the house had turned round inside
 its body
---
Reversals of this kind,
 strange deformities, tremendous paralyses, are often seen
.
  
---
to be inflicted by trade upon edifices-- either individual
 or in the aggregate as streets and towns-- which were
 originally planned for pleasure alone
---
Lively voices were heard this morning in the upper
 rooms
---
Going up, the floors above were found

---
the face
 of the boards was seen a tremble

---
a creak accom-
 panied a walker about the house like a spirit, wherever-

---
In the room Liddy Small-
 bury were and
.
---
was amply made up
 for by perfection  of hue, which at this winter- time was
 the softened ruddiness on a surface of high rotundity
 and, like the presentations of those great colourists
---
, it
 was a face which kept well back from the boundary
 between comeliness and the ideal
---
which consisted half
 of genuine feeling
---
superadded
 by way of duty
---
who for a face had a circular disc,
---
furrowed less by age
 than by long gazes of perplexity at distant objects
---
Maryann suspended the brush.
  
---
The tramp of a horse was apparent,.
---
The paces slackened,.
---
what was most unusual
---
The door was
 tapped with the end of a crop or stick.
  
---
con-
 tinued by aspect instead of narrative
---
sheba continued.
   Rat- tat
---
- tat- tat, resounded more decisively from Bath-
 sheba's oak.
  
---
" Maryann, you go!"
---
The argument was unanswerable after a glance at
 Maryann.
  
---
" Liddy-- you must
---
they were sorting
---
The door opened, and
---
a deep voice said--
  "?"
  
---
" I'll see, sir."" Dear, what a thirtover place this world is!"
---
who
 had a voice for each class of remark
---
who could toss a pancake or twirl
 a mop with the accuracy of pure mathematics, and

---
who at this moment showed hands shaggy with frag-
 ments of dough and arms encrusted with flour)
---
one of two things do happen--
---
you're a fright
 with dust
---
" Yes-- that sounds very well.
---
" Say-- that will do."
  
---
" Oh, very well." said the deep voice."
---
" All I wanted to ask was,?"
  
---
we may know to- night.
---
The horse's tramp then recommenced and,
 and
---
the door closed.
  
---
" What a bother this dusting is! 
---
Lord--
 the money might as well have been thrown out of the
 window.
---
This child was one of the Coggans who,
 with the Smallburys, were as common among the
 families of this district as the Avons and Derwents
 among our rivers.
---
Well-- who gave it you, Teddy
---
Where are you going,
---
and
 I said," Yes."
   What did you say that for?"
  
---
" What a pucker everything is in!"
---
discontentedly when the child had gone
---
You ought
---
to be married by this time, and
---
" Did anybody ever want?"
---
you miss
---
when they were again alone
---
" How nice it must seem."
---
when most of us
 are glad to say," Thank you
---
my
 face is for mouths of consequence."
---
which was now getting low- toned and dim with
 the earliest films of night
---
which, distinctly organized in other respects
---
The whole string of trailing
 individuals advanced in the completest balance of inten-
 tion, like the remarkable creatures known as Chain
 Salpae,, have
.
---
one will common to a whole family
---
Some were, as
 usual, in snow- white smock- frocks of Russia duck, and
 some in whitey- brown ones of drabbet-- marked on the
 wrists, breasts, backs, and sleeves with honeycomb- work.

---
" The Philistines be upon us."
---
Maryann, go down and and."





---
The first is."
  
---
that the bailiff is
 dismissed for thieving, and

" The next matter is"

" Have you done anything?"
  
---
said Jacob Smallbury,' and

---
" And the new shepherd have been to Buck's Head,
 by Yalbury,, but

thinking" said Laban Tall.
  
---
" Has n't William Smallbury been to Casterbridge?"
  
---
" It wants a quarter to six at present."
---
are you there
---
the person addressed
---
" And what are you?"
  
---
though public thought will out
---
" What do you do on the farm?"
  
---
Now here are ten shillings in addi-
 tion as a small present,."
  
---
"--
 what's your name?
---
" Matthew Moon, ma'am." said a singular framework of
 clothes with nothing of any consequence inside them,
 which advanced with the toes in no definite direction
 forwards, but turned in or out as they chanced to swing.
  
---
" Matthew Mark, did you say?--
---
Ten and twopence halfpenny
 is the sum put down to you
---
" Ten and twopence halfpenny
 is the sum put down to you, I see?" Yes, mis'ess." said Matthew, as the rustle of wind
 among dead leaves.
  
---
" Here it is and ten shillings.
---
How come you to
?"
  
---
said Henery Fray in
 an undertone," and
---
Andrew Randle, here's yours--
---
I suppose Here we be,' a b'lieve."
---
was echoed in shrill
 unison.
  
---
" What have you been doing?"
  
---
when they
 go upon your seeds and
---
a pair as ever was
---
Henery slinking off to a corner
---
Laban Tall, you'll stay on working
 for me?"
  
---
that pays me well
---
" Oh, you are.
---
Well, Laban, will
 you stay on?
---
The names remaining were called in the same
 manner.
  
---
" Has William Smallbury returned?"
  
---
suggested Henery Fray,.
  
---
Henery said,
" and
---
who
 had just appeared on the scene, and
---
for the name could never be got rid
 of in the parish
---
" It is rather unfortunate."
  
---
it shows."
  
---
how
 the sins of the parents are visited upon the children,
 mem
---
And you quite understand your duties?
---
Certainly nobody without
 previous information would have.
---
The
 case is not unexampled in high places.
---
Footsteps were heard in the passage,,
 rather at the expense of velocity.

---
Here's Billy Smallbury
---
" come from Caster-
 bridge."

---
" And what's the news?
---
if it
 had n't been for the weather
---
" Come at last, is it?
---
" said Henery.

---
, they said,"."

---
The Eleventh Dragoon-
 Guards be gone away, and
---
new troops have come
---
The Eleventh left last week for Melchester and onwards.

---
The Route came from Government like a thief in the
 night,.
---
the Eleventh knew
 it almost,
---
they were on the march
---
They passed near
 here."

---

---
" Yes." continued William," they pranced down."
---
so' tis
 said, in glorious notes of triumph.
---
there was not a dry eye throughout
 the town among the public- house people and the name-
 less women!"

---
" But they're not gone to any war?"

---
" No, ma'am; but they be gone.
---
who may
---
which is very close connected
---
And
 so I said to myself,. There, ma'am,
 that's it in black and white."

---
" Well, we are not likely to know more to- night, at
 any rate."
---
" But one of you had better
."

---
" Now mind, you have a mistress instead of a master

---
if you serve me well
---
if there are any such, but
---
" Excellent well said.
---
before you are awake
---
before you are afield
---
Then this small- thesmothete stepped from the table,
 and.
---
the door was
---
if that may be called a prospect
 of which the chief constituent was darkness
---
It was a night when sorrow may come to the
 brightest without causing any great sense of incongruity:
: 
---
when, with impressible persons, love becomes solicitous-
 ness, hope sinks to misgiving, and faith to hope
---
when
 the exercise of memory does not stir feelings of regret
 at opportunities for ambition that have been passed by,
 and
---
anticipation does not prompt to enterprise.

---
The scene was a public path, bordered on the left
 hand by a river, behind which rose a high wall.
---
On
 the right was a tract of land, partly meadow'and partly

---
The changes of the seasons are less obtrusive on
 spots of this kind than amid woodland scenery.
---
Still,
 to a close observer, they are just as perceptible
---
; the
 difference is.
---
that their media of manifestation are less
 trite and familiar than such well- known ones as the
 bursting of the buds or the fall of the leaf
---
Many are
 not so stealthy and gradual as we may be apt to
 imagine in considering the general torpidity of a moor
 or waste.
---
This climax of the series had been reached to- night on
 the aforesaid moor, and; suggestive
 of anything, proclaiming nothing, and without more
 character than that of being the limit of something
 else-- the lowest layer of a firmament of snow.
---
for the first time in the season
 its irregularities were forms without features
---
From
 this chaotic skyful of crowding flakes the mead and
 moor momentarily received additional clothing,.
---
The vast
 arch of cloud above was strangely low, and
---
it were the roof of a large dark cavern, gradually sinking
 in upon its floor
---
that encrusting the
 earth
---
that
 the snow lining the heavens and would soon unite into one mass without any
 intervening stratum of air at all
---
We turn our attention to the left- hand characteristics;
.
---
which were flatness in respect of the river, verticality
 in respect of the wall behind it, and darkness as to
 both
---
These features made up the mass.
---
If anything
 could be darker than the sky
---
, it was the wall, and
---
if any
 thing could be gloomier than the wall
---
it was the river
 beneath.
---
The indistinct summit of the facade was
 notched and pronged by chimneys here and there, and

---
An indescribable succession of dull blows, perplexing
 in their regularity, sent with difficulty
 through the fluffy atmosphere.
---
It was a neighbouring
 clock striking
---
ten The bell was in the open air, and

---
About this hour the snow abated: 
---
ten flakes fell

---
where twenty had fallen
---
, then one had the room of
 ten.
---
Not long after a form moved by the brink of
 the river.

---
By its outline upon the colourless background, a close
 observer might have seen.
---
that it was small
---
This was
 all that was positively discoverable,.

---
though it seemed
 human
---
The shape went slowly along, but
---
"
" I shall be up before you are awake; I shall be
 afield before you are up; and I shall have breakfasted
. In short, I shall astonish you all.
 At this time some words
 were spoken aloud: --
" One.
---
Between each utterance the little shape advanced
 about half a dozen yards.
---
It was evident now.

---
that
 the windows high in the wall were being counted
---
The word" Five" represented the fifth window from
 the end of the wall.

---
Here the spot stopped, and.
---
The
 figure was stooping.
---
Then a morsel of snow flew
 across the river towards the fifth window.
---
It smacked
 against the wall at a point several yards from its mark.

---
who had ever seen bird
---
Another attempt, and another; till by degrees the
 wall must have become pimpled with the adhering
 lumps of snow 
---
The river would have been;
---
seen by day.
---
which races middle and sides
 with the same gliding precision
---
that deep smooth sort, any irregularities of
 speed being immediately corrected by a small whirl-
 pool
---
The window was struck again in the same manner.

---
Then a noise was heard,.
---
apparently produced by
 the opening of the window
---
This was followed by a
 voice from the same quarter.

---
The tones were masculine, and not those of surprise.

---
The high wall being that of a barrack, and marriage
 being looked upon with disfavour in the army, assigna-
 tions and communications
---
had probably been made
 across the river before tonight.

---
" said the blurred spot in the
 snow, tremulously.

---
This person was so much like a mere shade upon
 the earth, and the other speaker so much a part of
 the building
---
, that one would have said.

---
the wall was
 holding a conversation with the snow
---
" O, Frank-- do n't you know me?
---
" said the spot.

---
The dialogue went on:
"?"

---
How did you come here
---
which was your window
---
you would come at all
---
It was a wonder you
 found me here.
---
" I asked." I did not expect you to- night. Indeed, I did not
 think. I am orderly to- morrow."
" You said."

---
that you might
---
You are glad to see me,
 Frank?"

---
I was" Well-- I said."
" Yes, I mean that I might."
" Can you-- come to me!"

---
The bugle has sounded,
---
the
 barrack gates are closed, and
---
We are
 all of us as good as in the county gaol till to- morrow
 morning."

---
The words- were
 in a faltering tone of disappointment.

---
I have no leave." Then I sha n't see you till then!"" How did you get here from Weatherbury?"

---
And Frank, when will it be?"

---
" I walked-- some part of the way-- the rest by the
 carriers."
" I am surprised."
" That you promised."

---
I do n't" O You do!
---
It weighs me
 to the earth.
---
It makes first by you."

---

---
what ought
---
when shall we be
---
Well--  you have."

---
Will it be by banns or license?"

---
" Oh, I" see." I have money." Banns, I should think." And we live in two parishes."

---
" My lodgings are in St. Mary's, and
---
this is not.
---
So
 they will have."

---
" Is that the law?"

---
O Frank-- you think me forward,
---
will you
---
And you said
---
lots of times you would marry me, and

---
It is foolish.
---
will
 you in yours
---
We'll settle in a few days."

---
O Frank-- you think me forward, I am
 afraid! Do n't, dear Frank-- will you-- for I love you so.
 and-- I-- I-- I-- --"
  " Do n't cry, now! If i said so, of
 course I will."
" And shall I put up the banns in my parish, and?"
" You have the permission of the officers?"

---
" O-- how is it?
---
You said
---
you almost had before

---
you left Casterbridge."

---
" The fact is,.
---
Your coming like this

---
Will you

seq be to- morroy

** qoDe, and is so sudden and unexpected."

---
I forgot I'll go away now." Yes-- yes-- it is.
---
It was wrong of me.

---
Will you come and?
---
they
 think me one.
---
And the noise was again heard of a window closing
.
---
The little spot moved away
---
a subdued exclamation was heard inside the
 wall.

---
An expostulation
 followed, but
---
it was indistinct; and
---
it became

 and pillars, and latterly dignified by- the name of Corn Ex-

The greater number carried in their hands

 their backs turned, and restful things in general, which

 peregrinations.

THE VALENTINE


 IT was Sunday afternoon in the farmhouse, on the
 thirteenth of February.
---
Dinner being over, Bathsheba,
 for want of a better companion
---
The mouldy pile was dreary
 in winter- time
---
before the candles were lighted and
---
the
 shutters closed
---
; the atmosphere of the place seemed
 as old as the walls
---
; every nook behind the furniture
 had a temperature of its own,

which was an old one
 in other annals

before night threw a
 shade over its less prominent angles and

The book was opened-- the leaves, drab with age,

quite worn away at much- read verses by the fore"

 were moved along under the line as an aid to the vision

 the abstract facing Folly in the concrete.

 substance thereon

A rusty patch immediately upon
 the verse,, told
---
that this was not the first time
 the old volume had been used for the purpose.

---
The' verse was repeated

; the book turned round

" Who did you try?"

This move was unexpected, and proportionately dis

where the atmosphere was that of a Puritan Sunday

---
The disturbance was as the first floating
 weed to Columbus-- the eontemptibly little suggesting
 possibilities of the infinitely great.

The letter must have had an origin and a motive.

The mysterious influences of night invested the writing
 with the presence of the unknown writer.
---
as the pen went on
---
had curved itself to a
 certain expression-- the corners had
 moved with all their natural tremulousness: ?

---
what had
 been the expression
---
the words written, had no individuality.
---
The moon shone to- night, and
---
its light was not of
 a customary kind.

the pale sheen had.

---
Nothing more was there.
---
The solemn and reserved yeoman again closed the
 letter, and.
---
Then the dawn drew on.
---
It was one of the usual slow sunrises of this time of
 the year, and the sky, pure violet in the zenith, was
 leaden to the northward, and murky to the east, where,
 over the snowy down or ewe- lease on Weatherbury
 Upper Farm, and apparently resting upon the ridge, the
 only half of the sun yet visible burnt rayless, like a red
 and flameless fire shining over a white hearthstone.

---
The whole effect resembled a sunset as childhood
.

---
In other directions, the fields and sky were so much
 of one colour by the snow,.
---
that it was difficult in a
 hasty glance;
 and
---
the horizon occurred

in general there was here, too, that before- mentioned
 preternatural inversion of light and shade which attends

 state of a soft fleece

It was
 the mail- cart-- a crazy, two- wheeled vehicle, hardly
 heavy enough to resist a puff of wind.
---
The driver held
 out a letter.

pecting another anonymous one-- so greatly are people's
 ideas of probability a mere sense that precedent will
 repeat itself.

 sky, a figure was visible, like the black snuff in the
 midst of a candle- flame.

 rays

A small figure on all fours followed behind.

; the articles in course of transit were hurdles.

It was an opportunity.

The glow stretched down in this direction
 now, and:   Boldwood
 followed at a distance.




 CHAPTER XV




---
the shepherd was apparently bent
---
THE scarlet and orange light outside the malthouse did
 not penetrate to its interior, which was, as usual, lighted
 by a rival glow of similar hue, radiating from the hearth.

---
This was
 eaten on the plateless system, which is performed by
 placing a slice of bread upon the table, the meat flat
 upon the bread, a mustard plaster upon the meat, and
 a pinch of salt upon the whole,.

---
when the severed lamp is impaled on the
 knife, elevated, and sent the proper way of food
---
The maltster's lack of teeth appeared.
---
till it was doubtful
---
for Warren's was a
 sort of clubhouse
---
, we get a fine day, and
---
then down
 comes a snapper at night
---
which
 had been opened the previous moment
---
The speech
 and entry had not seemed
---
it
 certainly was comfortable.

---
the
 maltster inquired.

---
This was recognized by all as the conclusion of some
 gloomy speech which had been expressed in thought
 alone during the shake of the head;
---
that they would be required for use again directly

---
" All will be ruined, and ourselves too, or there's no
 meat in gentlemen's houses!
---
" said Mark Clark.

---
" A headstrong maid, that's-- and.
---
Pride and vanity have ruined
 many a cobbler's dog.
---
, you do,
---
Do ye foller me?"

---
Your lot is your lot, and
---
" I do: but no baily-- I deserved that place."" There,' twas to be, I
 suppose. Scripture is nothing;
."

---
if you do good
---
for you do n't get rewarded, but
---
" No, no; I do n't agree with'ee there." said Mark
 Clark.
---
God's a perfect gentleman in that respect."

---
Good works good pay,.
---
A short pause ensued, and as a sort of entr'acte

---
Henery turned and.

---
which the
 increase of daylight rendered no longer necessary even
 in the malthouse
---
they d'call

---
" I wonder it?" said the maltster."
---
Liddy saith she've a new one."

---
She've bought all but everything new.

---
There's heavy chairs for the stout, weak and wiry ones
 for the slender; great watches,."

---
said Mr. Clark.
---
firm loud tread was now heard
---
stamping outside;
 the door was opened about six inches, and.
---
the other side exclaimed--
" Neighbours
---
somebody on
, have ye got room for a few new- born
 lambs?"Ay, sure, shepherd
---
" said the conclave.

---
The door was flung back.
---
till it kicked the wall and

---
the dog George, whom
 to fetch from Norcombe, stalked
 solemnly behind.

---
We sha n't have done by Lady Day."

---
We've no lambing- hut here,.
---
And how is it with you to- day, malter?"

---
And how was the old place at Norcombe,
?
---
when ye went for your dog
---
you would n't
---
Tis altered very much."

---
" Is it true
---
that Dicky Hill's wooden cider- house is

---
" Yes; and Tompkins's old apple- tree is; and no help from
 other trees."

---
-- you do n't say it!
---
stirring times we
 live in--."

---
And you can mind the old well that used to be in
 the middle of the place?
---
That's turned into a solid
 iron pump with a large stone trough, and all complete."

---
what we live
---
They've been talking but now of the mis'ess's
 strange doings."

---
"" said Mark Clark;" but

---
sternly," now you mind this!

---
I do n't allow it. Do
 you hear?"

---
replied
 Mr. Clark, cordially.

---
, that's."
---
Matthew just said-- --"

---
" Matthew Moon, what have you been saying?
---
Why ye know?
---
I would n't harm a worm-- no,
 not one underground worm" said Matthew Moon,
.

---
" Well, somebody has-- and."

---
" That's my fist."
---
it gave a bump or two thereon,
---
that their eyes all thoroughly took in the
 idea of fistiness
---
earnestly expressed by their features
---
that their
 minds did not wander to Holland for a moment on
 account of this statement, but
---
which gave rise to the figure
---
Mark
 Clark cried
---
The dog George looked up at the same time after the
 shepherd's menace, and
---
I'm a Dutchman."
 All earnestly expressed by their features that their
 minds did not wander to Holland for a moment on
 account of this statement, but were deploring the
 difference which gave rise to the figure; and Mark
 Clark cried" Hear, hear; just what I should ha' said." Now, do n't ye take on so, shepherd, and sit down!"

---
said Henery, with a deprecating peacefulness equal to
 anything of the kind in Christianity.

---
We hear.
---
that ye be a extraordinary good and
 clever man, shepherd
---
" we wish
---
we were
---
, do n't we, neighbours
---
" Ay, that we do, sure.
---
" Who's been telling you
---
Tis blowed about from pillar
---
to post quite common,"
 said Matthew.
---
" We hear."

---
that ye can tell the time as
 well by the stars as we can by the sun and moon,
 shepherd
---
before you came
---
And so
 you used?"
---
" And how Farmer James would cuss, and
---
, you see,

that it
 should be no worse

The genial warmth of the fire now began.

that they were born

 acquired with astonishing aptitude.

ye have the skins of the
 dead lambs
---
Ye be very badly used, shepherd..
---
which the deprivation of lamb skins
 could hardly have caused
---
Before any further remark had been added a shade
, and
---
you were here
---
a letter was put
 into my hand, which I opened without reading the
 address.
---
it is yours
---
You must excuse the
 accident please."

---
l think

---
these few lines will reach you, which I wrote to thank you
 for your kindness to me the night I left Weatherbury in a
 reckless way
---
All has ended
 well, and
---
if you would keep the
 contents of this letter a secret for the present, dear friend
---
We mean.
---
The sergeant grew up in Weatherbury.
---
" Have you read it, Mr. Boldwood?"
---
;
" if not, you had better do so.
---
the farmer murmured,".
---
it seems.
---
soon after an infant was
 horn; and
---
while money was forthcoming all
---
" Well--  what have you come for?"

---
said the junior shepherd,
.
---
that you must come directly'
---
Two more ewes
 have twinned
---
-- that's, Shepherd Oak."

---
what's the matter
---
" Oh, that's it."
---
before we go
---
we'll mark
 this lot and."

---
vanished with them in the direction of
 the lambing field hard by--
---
their frames being now in a
 sleek and hopeful state,
---
in which the fold was constructed
---
A letter was revealed-- Bath-
 sheba's.

---
if you know
---
whose writing this is
---
" The letter could of course
 be no other than anonymous, or
---
the inquiry would not
 have been necessary.

---
" Is it I?"
---
" The question was perfectly fair."
---
You know
---
it is always expected
---
that
 privy inquiries will be made: 
---
that's where the-- fun
 lies.
---
" If the word" fun" had been" torture."
---
They were about to
 disperse, when a smart footstep, entering the porch and
 coming up the central passage
---
The step echoed with a ring unusual in a church
---
; it
 was the clink of spurs.
---
Everybody looked.
---
The officiating curate,, perceived the new- comer, and.
---
then beckoned to the clerk, they also went up the chancel steps.

---
's wait
---
The majority again sat down.

---
There was a creaking of machinery behind, and

---
some of the young ones turned their heads.
---
being driven by the same clock
 machinery that struck the large bell in the tower
---
the church was a close screen,.
---
the
 door of which was kept
---
At present, how-
 ever, the door was open, and the egress of the jack and the mannikin's retreat
---
into.the
 nook again, were visible to many, and audible through-
 out the church.

---
The jack had struck half- past eleven.

---
The young sergeant stood still with the abnormal
 rigidity of the old pillars around.
---
The silence grew, and
---
as the
 minutes went on
---
nobody else appeared, and
---
not a
 soul moved.
---
The rattle of the quarter- jack again from
 its niche, its blows for three- quarters, its fussy retreat,
 were almost painfully abrupt, and.

---
many of the
 congregation to start palpably
---
a voice whispered
 again.

---
There began now that slight shifting of feet, that
 artificial coughing among several, which betrays a
 nervous suspense.
---
At length there was a titter.
---
But
 the soldier never moved.
---
The clock ticked on.
---
titters and giggling became more
 frequent.
---
Then came a dead silence.
---
Every one was
 waiting for the end.
---
Some persons may have noticed
 how extraordinarily the striking of quarters..
---
It was hardly credible
---
that
 the jack had not got wrong with the minutes and
---
when the
 rattle began again
---
, the puppet emerged,
---
the four
 quarters were struck fitfully as before:
---
that there was a malicious leer upon
 the hideous creature's face,
---
there was no
 giggle this time.

---
The clergyman glided into the vestry, and
---
the clerk
 vanished.
---
The sergeant had not yet turned
---
Two bowed and toothless old

---
almsmen then looked at each other and; but
---
the sound had a strange weird
 effect in that place.

---
which several overhanging wood buildings of old time
 cast a picturesque shade
---
which had been one of intense anxiety
---
that
 church with the spire was All Saints'
---
as you said
---
it could be as well
---
that I
 was in All Souls' But I was n't much frightened, for
 I thought."
" You fool, for so fooling me!
---
" Shall it be to- morrow, Frank?"
---
the mistake was not such a terrible thing
---
Now, dear
 Frank, when shall it be?"

---
God knows!
---
there was Eve.
---
The
 farmer took courage, and
---
Material causes and emotional effects are not.
---
The result from capital
 employed in the production of any movement of a
 mental nature is sometimes as tremendous as the cause
 itself.
---
, their usual intuition, either from carelessness or
 inherent defect, seemingly fails, and

---
hence it was.

---
Boldwood, it must be remembered,
---
if you remember
---
; a mere child's word on the
 point has the weight of an R.A.'s.
---
what circumstances suggest
---
what they do not suggest
---
; it was debasing loveliness, and.

---
This
 was a triumph; and
---
had it come naturally
---
But it had been brought about by
 misdirected ingenuity, and
---
which had owed
 its existence
---
The worst features of this arrangement were
---
that,, an apology would
---
whose god
 was their town, who might happen to be compelled to
 linger about this nook for a day
---
Genteel strangers,, heard the sound of
 light wheels, and but
---
it was.

---
They heard the sound of wheels yet once more, and
 were re- animated to expectancy: .

---
it was only Mr. Bold-
 wood
---
which are to a farm
---
what a fireplace is to a
 room
---
the
 stables,, were behind,.
---
their lower portions being lost
 amid bushes of laurel
---
as thus viewed, they pre-
 sented alternations of roan and bay, in shapes like a
 Moorish arch,
---
the tail being a streak down the midst
 of each.
---
Over these, and lost to the eye gazing in
 from the outer light, the mouths of the same animals
 could be heard.

---
the steady grind
 of all the eaters was occasionally diversified by the
 rattle of a rope or the stamp of a foot
---
, the celibate would walk
 and meditate of an evening till the moon's rays streamed
 in through the cobwebbed windows, or total darkness
 enveloped the scene.

---
That stillness,
 seemed so precisely
 like the rest of inanition, may have been the perfect
 balance of enormous antagonistic forces-- positives and
 negatives in fine adjustment.
---
Stagnant or rapid, it was never
 slow.
---
-who read

---
when they were comedies
---
that the dark and
 silent shape was a hotbed of tropic intensity
---
Nobody knew entirely;
---
for though it
 was possible
---
It was now early spring-- the time of going to grass
 with the sheep, when they have the first feed of the
 meadows,.
---
before these are laid up for mowing
---
which had been blowing east for several weeks
---
The
 wind,,
 had veered to the southward, and
---
the middle of spring
 had come abruptly-- almost without a beginning.
---
It
 was that period in the vernal quarter.
---
when we map

---
the Dryads to be waking for the season
---
The
 vegetable world begins, till in the completest silence of lone gardens
 and trackless plantations,
---
everything seems-help-

---
with which the powerful tugs of
 cranes and pulleys in a noisy city are but pigmy efforts
---
as the moon lights up a great
 tower
---
It is the usual experience of strong natures when they
 love.

---
It was.

---
It has been observed
 more than once, and
---
that the causes of love are chiefly
 subjective
---
which was genuine lover's love
---
Beyond
 it the ground was melodious with ripples, and the sky
 with larks; the low bleating of the flock mingling with
 both.
---
Mistress and man were engaged in the operation
 of making a lamb" take.
---
" which is performed.
---
that neither would recognize
---
The cabala of this erotic philosophy
 seemed.
---
Every turn, look, word, and accent
 contained a mystery quite distinct from its obvious
 import, and
---
what a great flame a little Wildfire was likely to
 kindle
---
what a flirt is supposed
---
But a
 resolution to avoid an evil is seldom framed.





---
till the evil
 is so far advanced as to make avoidance impossible
---
The great aids
 to idealization in love were present here: 
---
The smaller human elements were kept
 out of sight
---
that enter so largely into

---
; the pettinesses all earthly living and doing were disguised by the
 accident of lover and; and
---
It was the end of May.
---
when the farmer determined

---
to be no longer repulsed by trivialities or
---
distracted by
 suspense
---
they had

---
The sheep- washing pool was a perfectly circular basin
 of brickwork in the meadows, full of the clearest water.

---
The grass
 about the margin at this season was a sight to remember
 long-- in a minor sort of way.
---
Its activity in sucking
 the moisture from the rich damp sod. was almost a pro-
 cess observable by the eye.
---
The outskirts of this level
 water- meadow were diversified by rounded and hollow
 pastures, where just now every flower that was not a
 buttercup was a daisy.
---
The river slid along noiselessly
 as a shade
---
, the swelling reeds and sedge forming a
 flexible palisade upon its moist brink.
---
the leaves of which were new,
 soft, and moist
---
their colour being
 yellow beside a green-- green beside a yellow
---
From the recesses of this knot of foliage the loud
 notes of three cuckoos were resounding through the
 still air.

---
which the yellow pollen from the
 buttercups had bronzed in artistic gradations
---
flowed through the basin of the
 pool by an inlet and outlet at opposite points of its
 diameter
---
all dripping wet to the very roots of their hair,
 and
---
Flagons of cider
 were rolling about upon the green.
---
who stood on the brink
---
as they swam along
---
they began
---
They were let out
 against the stream, and through the upper opening, all
 impurities flowing away below.
---
who performed this latter operation
---
; they resembled dolphins under a
 fountain, every protuberance and angle of their clothes
 dribbling forth a small rill.

---
glided along by the river
---
that love was encircling

---
till they
 were completely past the bend of the river
---
Here,
 without being seen, they could hear the splashing and
 shouts of the washers above.

---
It was lowness and quiet
.
---
Silence
 has sometimes a remarkable power of showing itself as
 the disembodied soul of feeling wandering without its
 carcase, and
---
it is then more impressive than speech.

---
In the same way, to say a little is often.
---
As the consciousness expands on learning that what
 was fancied to be the rumble of wheels
---
My life is not my own, Miss Everdene--
---
all the motion was that of
 closing lips which had previously been a little parted.

---
But we all change, and
---
my change, in this matter, came
 with seeing you.
---
that my present way of living is bad in every respect
---
what would justify me to-- in
 accepting your offer
---
This giving back of dignity for dignity
---
seemed
---
My life is a burden without you.
---
you to let
---
me say

---
you care enough
---
for me to listen
 to what I have to tell
---
the
 farmer continued in an easier tone," and
---
If you can love me so
---
" Mr. Boldwood, it is painful to have to say I am
 surprised,
---
You are too
 dignified for me to suit you, sir."
  
---
If you will only pardon my thought-

---
it was something more--
---
that it was a sort of
 prophetic instinct-- the beginning of a feeling that you
 would like me
---
You torture me
---
it was done in
 thoughtlessness
---
it is not true
---
that you have

---
the white row of upper teeth, and keenly-
 cut lips already noticed,.

---
which was immediately contradicted by the pleasant
 eyes
---
" But you will just think-- in kindness and conde-
!

---
scension think--
---
You shall have no cares
---
worried
 by no household affairs
---
will-- you shall never have so

---
because it is he same
---
if you do n't like it
---
you shall
 have a pony- carriage of your own
---
you seem
 to me
---
-- nobody knows--
---
God only knows--!"

---
how much
 you are to me
---
me to feel nothing.
---
Will you let the matter
 rest now?
---
you were going.
---
you suffer so
---
that you do n't absolutely refuse
---
not answer."I may speak to you again on the
 subject?
---
you may think of me
---
us go on
---
who did not
 know
---
The rarest offerings of the purest loves are but a self-
 indulgence, and no generosity at all.

---
In every point of
 view, ranging from politic to passionate, it was desirable
.
---
It appears
;
---
because possession is not
 possible without marriage
---
because marriage is not possible with,
 out possession
---
with totally differing aims the method is
 the same on both sides.
---
Besides, Bath-
 sheba's position as absolute mistress of a farm and house
 was a novel one, and
---
the novelty had not yet begun.

---
for it would have affected few
---
Still the reluctance remained.
---
that it would be ungenerous
---
; unluckily they
 always remained thoughts.
---
Only a few were irrational
 assumptions; but
---
, unfortunately, they were the ones
 which most frequently grew into deeds.
  
---
All the surrounding
 cottages were more or less scenes of the same operation;

---
the scurr of whetting spread into the sky from all parts
 of the village as from an armury previous to a campaign.

---
Peace and war kiss each other at their hours of prepara-
 tion-- sickles, scythes, shears, and pruning- hooks, ranking
 with swords, bayonets, and lances, in their common
 necessity for point and edge.

---
as
 Eros is represented
---
The peculiar motion involved in turning a wheel
 has a wonderful tendency to benumb the mind.
---
It
 is a sort of attenuated variety of Ixion's punishment,
 and.
---
settle by degrees in a leaden lump somewhere be-
 tween the eyebrows and the crown
---
" Will you turn, Gabriel, and?"

---
me hold the shears
---
" My head is in a'whirl, and
---
which
 required a little nicety in sharpening
---
" Yes, they did.
---
You do n't hold
 the shears right
---
you would n't know the
 way-- hold like this
---
" That will do."
---
them held
---
the grinding went on.
  
---
Odd was not the idea
---
" What did they say?
---
before the
 year was out
---
Why, there's
 nothing in it.
---
A more foolish remark was never made,
 and
---
you to contradict it
---
that's."
  
---
" They must have heard our conversation.
---
you mean
---
", to tell a story and say.
---
you just to mention
---
that it was
 not
---
if you wish,
---
your opinion."I suppose not
---
which directed them
---
;
 but, as does not always happen, time gained was
 prudence insured.
---
It must be added, however,.
---
that
 time was very seldom gained
---
This is a lover's
 most stoical virtue,.
---
as the lack of it is a lover's most
 venial sin
---
The next thing was.

---
" Perhaps you do n't like the rudeness of my repri-
; but
---
it is rudeness
---
it would do good
---
On the contrary, my opinion of you is so low,
---
when you try not to

---
you are amusing
---
just as when you wish

---
you sometimes say a sensible word

---
It was a hard hit, but
---
had; the
 impetuosity of passion unrequited is bearable,.
---
even if
 it stings and anathematizes there is a triumph in the
 humiliation, and a tenderness in the strife
---
This was
.
---
you do n't care for
---
And even, Miss Everdene,, you might have let some way of true loving- kindness, and not by sending
 him a valentine's letter."

---
So you'll please leave the farm at the end of the week!"

---
nether lip quivered now.

---
me see your face any more
---
" Very well, Miss Everdene-- so it shall be."

---
as Moses left the presence of Pharaoh

A MESSAGE


 GABRIEL OAK had ceased when on Sunday
 afternoon the elderly gentlemen Joseph Poorgrass
---
,
 Matthew Moon, Fray, and half- a- dozen others, came
.
 
---
Whatever is the matter
---
" Seventy!" said Moon.

---
"-- Sheep have broke fence."
---
said Fray.

---
"-- And got into a field of young clover." said Tall.

---
"-- Young clover!" said Moon.

---
" And they be getting blasted.
---
" said Henery Fray.

---
" That they be.
---
if they bain't got
 out and cured!"said Tall
---
Fray's forehead was wrinkled
 both perpendicularly and crosswise, after the pattern of
 a portcullis, expressive of a double despair.
---
Tall's lips were thin, and
---
Matthew's
 jaws sank, and
---
the
 strongest muscle happened
---
when who should come in
---
but
 Henery there:" Joseph the sheep have

---
That's enought
---
"-- that's enough!
---
particularly when the effect
 was heightened by a rather dashing velvet dress, care-
 fully put on before a glass
---
Having once received the stimulus they went round among the sheep
 with a will.
---
The majority of the afflicted animals were

---
These were
 bodily lifted out, and
---
the others driven into the adjoining
 field.
---
Here, after the lapse of a few minutes, several
 more fell down, and.

---
as they rolled
 there
---
Many of them foamed at the mouth, their breathing
 being quick and short, whilst the bodies of all were
 fearfully distended.

---
" Sheep are such unfortunate animals!
---
there's always something happening to them!
---
a flock pass a year without getting into some scrape
 or other
---
There's only one way of saving them.
---
"" said Tall.

---
" They must be pierced in the side with a thing made
 on purpose."

---
" Can you do it?
---
We ca n't, nor you neither.
---
It must
 be done in a particular spot.
---
If ye go to the right or

---
you stab the ewe and
---
Not
 even a shepherd can do it, as a rule."

---
Can I?" Then they must die."
---
" said Laban Tall.

---
" O no, ma'am" said Matthew.
---
Gable went and
---
, Farmer
 Boldwood hev got the thing they do it with.'
---
Is n't it,
 Joseph?"
  
---
" That's what
' tis."

---
" Ay, sure-- that's the machine."
---
Get
 somebody to cure the sheep instantly!"
  
---
All then stalked or in consternation, without any idea of who it was to be.

---
In a minute they had vanished through the gate, and

---
One of the ewes here contracted its muscles horribly,
.
---
The
 leap was an astonishing one.
---
The ewe fell heavily, and

---
The sheep was dead.

---
It is often flung out as a sort of prop
 to support a decaying conviction which, whilst strong,
 required no enunciation to prove it so.
---
Tall scrambled off to the field, and
---
So did all the rest.
---
The Flats, Cappel's Piece,
 shrank almost to a point,.
---
The cottage was visible as a white spot on the
 opposite hill, backed by blue firs.
---
The horse was seen
, and
---
the wearisome series had: Whitepits, Springmead,
 Cappel's Piece, The Flats, Middle Field, Sheeplands,
 Sixteen Acres.
---
The rider neared them.
---
It was Tall.

---
Tall came into the inclosure, and.

---
beggars must n't be choosers
---
" What!" said the young farmer,.
---
unless you request en
,
---
Another of the flock sprang into the air, and.

---
as if they suppressed opinion
---
The
 strait could
 not be disguised longer
---
crying bitterly;
 they all saw it; and
---
said William Small-
 bury, compassionately.
---
" O, it is a wicked cruelty to me
---
it is
---
---- it is!"
---
I would n't Tall, come indoors."

---
which follow a fit of crying as a ground- swell
---
The note was none the less polite for being
 written in a hurry.
---
whether such strategy were
 justifiable
---
The note was despatched as the message
, and
---
It was an anxious quarter of an hour that intervened
 between the messenger's departure and the sound of the
 horse's tramp again outside.
---
She- could not watch this
 time, but,.
  
---
The case, however, was a promising one.
---
Such imperiousness
 would have damned a little less beauty; and
---
on the
 other hand, such beauty would have redeemed a little
 less imperiousness.

---
when the horse was heard
---
" O, Gabriel, how could you serve me so unkindly
---
It was a small tube or trochar, with a lance passing
 down the inside; and
---
that would have graced a hospital surgeon
---
as it stood in the tube
---
A current of air rushed up the tube, forcible
 enough to have extinguished a candle held at the
 orifice.

---
It has been said; and
---
that mere ease after torment is de-
 light for a time
---
the countenances of these poor
 creatures expressed it now.
---
Forty- nine operations were
 successfully performed.
---
necessitated by the far- gone state of some of the flock
---
Four had died
---
; three
 recovered without an operation.
---
which had thus strayed and
---
The total number of
 sheep injured themselves
 so dangerously was fifty- seven.

---
" Gabriel, will you stay on with me?
---
because there was going

---
when they
 have them as by lacking good spirits when they are
 indispensable
---
an opportunity without them is barren,
---
when the favourable- con-
 junction should have occurred
---
the neap might soon come which
 could not.

---
It was the first day of June, and
---
the sheep- shearing
 season culminated,.
---
the landscape, even to the leanest
 pasture, being all health and colour
---
Every green was
 young
---
, every pore was open, and
---
every stalk was swollen
 with racing currents of juice.
---
God was palpably present
 in the country, and
---
the devil had gone with the world
 to town.
---
None of these were
 clothed to any extent worth mentioning,.
---
each appearing

---
An angularity
 of lineament, and a fixity of facial machinery in general,
 proclaimed.

---
that serious work was the order of the day
---
They sheared in the great barn,.
---
which on ground- plan resembled a
 church with transepts
---
It not only emulated the form
 of the neighbouring church of the parish, but.
---
Whether the barn had ever formed one
 of a group of conventual buildings nobody seemed to be
 aware
---
; no trace of such surroundings remained.
---
The
 vast porches at the sides, lofty enough to admit a waggon
 laden to its highest with corn in the sheaf, were spanned
 by heavy- pointed arches of stone, broadly and boldly cut,
.
---
whose very simplicity was the origin of a grandeur not
 apparent in erections where more ornament has been
 attempted
---
The dusky, filmed, chestnut roof, braced
 and.

---
tied in by huge collars, curves, and diagonals,, because more wealthy in material,
 than nine- tenths of those in our modern churches
---
Along each side wall was a range of striding buttresses,
.

---
which were perforated by lancet openings,
---
One could say about this barn,.
---
what could hardly
 be said of either the church or the castle, akin to it in
 age and style,
---
which had dictated its
 original erection
---
that the purpose was the same with that to which it
 was still applied
---
Unlike and superior to either of
 those two typical remnants of mediaevalism, the old
 barn embodied practices which had suffered no mutila-
 tion at the hands of time.
---
Here at least the spirit of
 the ancient builders was at one with the spirit of the
 modern beholder.
---
Standing before this abraded pile,
 the eye regarded its present usage, the mind- dwelt upon
 its past history, with a satisfied sense of functional
 continuity throughout-- a feeling almost of gratitude,
 and quite of pride, at the permanence of the idea
 which had heaped it up.
---
that four centuries
 had neither proved
---
it to be founded on a mistake
---
that had battered it down
---
which a too curious reflection was apt to
 disturb in its ecclesiastical and military compeers
---
For
 once medievalism and modernism had a common stand-
 point.
---
The defence
 and salvation of the body by daily bread is still a study,
 a religion, and a desire.

---
To- day the large side doors were thrown open
 towards the sun,.
---
till it had grown as slippery and
 as rich in hue as the state- room floors of an Elizabethan
 mansion
---
the sun slanting in
 upon their bleached shirts
---
they flourished,
---
Beneath them a captive sheep lay,,.

---
till it quivered
 like the hot landscape outside
---
This picture of to- day in its frame of four hundred
 years ago did not produce that marked contrast between
 ancient and modern which is implied by the contrast
 of date.
---
In comparison with cities, Weatherbury was
 immutable.
---
The citizen's Then is the rustic's Now.

---
In London, twenty or thirty- years ago are old times;
 in Paris ten years, or five; in Weatherbury three or
 four score years were included in the mere present,
 and nothing less than a century set a mark on its
 face or tone.
---
Five decades hardly modified the cut of
 a gaiter, the embroidery of a smock- frock, by the breadth
 of a hair.
---
Ten generations failed.
---
In these Wessex nooks the busy out-
 sider's ancient times are only old
---
So the barn was natural to the shearers, and
---
the
 shearers were in harmony with the barn.

---
The spacious ends of the building, answering ecclesi-
 astically to nave and chancel extremities
---
the sheep being all collected in a crowd
 within these two enclosures; and
---
in one angle a catching-
 pen was formed,.
---
in which three or four sheep were

---
for the shearers to seize without
 loss of time
---
mellowed by tawny
 shade
---
that there was, and
---
that the animals were shorn
 close
---
who flitted and
---
which arose and overspread

---
where they were

---

 enviable,

there is a silence which says much:.

as the last snip resounded

since you took
 the first lock from its forehead
---
It is the first time that
 I have ever seen one done in less than half an hour."

---
The clean, sleek creature arose from its fleece-- how
 perfectly like Aphrodite rising from the foam
---
which lay on the floor
 in one soft cloud,
---
the portion visible
 being the inner surface only, which, never before exposed,
 was white as snow, and without flaw or blemish of the

Then up comes Maryann

who will,
 however, never experience the superlative comfort
 derivable from the wool as it here exists, new and pure
 -- before the unctuousness of its nature whilst in a
 living state
---
as cream is superior to milk- and- water
---
The rams, old
 ewes, and two- shear ewes had duly undergone their
 stripping, and
---
Nobody seemed, but
---
the talk,, was now totally

---
What they conversed about
---
Standing beside the sheep already
 shorn
---
, they went on talking again.
---
that in quiet discussion of any matter within reach
 of the speakers' eyes, these are usually fixed upon it
---
The animal plunged

what you are doing yourself

To an outsider there was not much to complain of
 in this remark; but
---
who" knew,
---
the wound was anointed, and
---
the
 shearing continued.

---
before they turned away
---
The horses' heads were put about, and
---
they trotted
 away.

---
" That means matrimony."
---
said Temperance Miller,

that's the size o't

" Well, better we d over the mixen than over the moor,"
 said Laban Tall,.

Henery Fray spoke,:

it be, for' tis a pity
---
We learn but
---
that it is not the rays which bodies
 absorb,
---
which they reject
---
that give them the
 colours they are known by
---
those,; and win the same way people
 are specialized by their dislikes and antagonisms,.

---
whilst
 their goodwill is looked upon as no attribute at all
---
Henery continued in a more complaisant mood: 
---
as nearly
 as a battered frame dared
---
when
 my pride is boiling wi' scarn
---
We do
---
Mistress Everdene, there's places empty,
 and; but
---
death and
 salvation overtook me for it
---
Such is my spirit."

---
" So I said," the spite-- no. the spite-- I did n't say spite--" but the villainy of the
 contrarikind." I said()," Yes; and I would have said it,. when I
 have a mind" You see the artfulness?
---
That was my depth!...
---
how'st know
---
" Ye have a right to believe it.
---
" said Henery, with
 dudgeon;
---
To be long- headed enough for a
 baily's place is a poor mere trifle-- yet a trifle more than
 nothing.
---
Do you heed me, neighbours?
---
My words, though made
 as simple, mid be rather deep for some heads."

---
But I mid see a little
 distance into things! However, I look round upon life quite cool.
 as I can" O yes, Henery, we quite heed ye."

---
" A strange old piece, goodmen-- whirled about from
 here to yonder,!
---
as if I were nothing But I have my depths; ha, and even my great
 depths! I might gird at a certain shepherd, brain to
 brain." A strange old piece, ye say!
---
half  gone  yet; and

when there's people far past four- score-- a

It was the unvaying custom in Weatherbury to
 sink minor differences when the maltster had to be

nobody
 can gainsay it."

" Ye be a very
 rare old  spectacle, malter, and we all admire ye for that
 gift.

when my senses were in
 prosperity
---
you was

That matters should
 continue

pleasant Maryann spoke,

?" said Maryann.
---
Pestilent
 moods had come, and.
---
This was mere exclamation-- the froth of the
 storm.
---
I do n't expect to
  at my time of life If I could hear of such a thing
" We workfolk shall have some lordly- junketing
 to- night."

 in within

" And there's two bushels of biffins for apple- pies,"

said Maryann.

" Well, I hope."" Yes; victuals and drink is a cheerful thing,
 and.'
---
if the form of words
 may be used

which we perish

Tis the gospel of the body, without

---
a long table was placed on the
 grass- plot beside the house,.
---
the end of the table being
 thrust over the sill of the wide parlour window and a
 foot or two into the room
---
until after they had begun
 and
---
," will you move again, please,

---
The gentleman- farmer was dressed in cheerful style,
 in a new coat and white waistcoat,.
---
who had been dismissed for theft
---
Supper being ended
---
That's better than t'other!

---
This lyric, when concluded, was received with a
 silently appreciative gaze at the table,.

---
who are independent of notices in the papers
---
that the
 performance, like a work by those established authors
, was a
 well- known delight which required no applause

the gift is wanting in
 me."

" Nonsense; wou'st never be so ungrateful, Joseph--
 never!

And mistress is looking hard at

" No, yer blushes be quite reasonable."

 a beauty's eyes get fixed on me

It would be a poor plain
 ballet of my own composure."

Hear, hear!" said the supper- party.

 consisted of the key- note and another, the latter being
 the sound chiefly dwelt upon

I- it was' all' i'-in the'-e spring',
 I- in A'-pril', Ma'-ay,

 people

when other persons are particularly serious

And the wil'-low' tre'-ee wi'ill twine'.

But the singer could not be set.
---
It was still the beaming time of evening,.
---
though
 night was stealthily making itself visible low down upon
 the ground, the western lines of light taking the earth
 without alighting upon it to any extent, or illuminating
 the dead levels at all
---
The sun had crept round the
 tree as a last effort before death, and.

---
the shearers' lower parts becoming steeped in
 embrowning twilight, whilst their heads and shoulders

---
that seemed inherent rather than

---
The sun went down in an ochreous mist; but
---
they
 sat, and.
---
The slow twilight expanded and.

---
completely before the signs of moving were shown
---
which
 revealed

Next came the question of the evening.
---
who hastened up into the coveted
 atmosphere
---
" Have you brought your flute?
---
it soon swelled
 to a steady clearness.
---
one
 of the verses to be remembered for many months
---
The shearers reclined
 against each other as at suppers in the early ages of the
 world, and so silent and absorbed at the end of the ballad, when the last tone loitered on
 to an inexpressible close
---
were they and

---
that her
 breathing could almost be heard between the bars;
---
, there arose that buzz of
 pleasure which is the attar of applause.

---
It is scarcely necessary.
---
It was
---
they thanked or
---
when they were inattentive
---
The meaning lay in the difference between
 actions, none of which had any meaning of itself;
 and
---
which lovers are
 troubled with
---
Recovering
 from the softer impressions, the shearers rose
---
where praise is due
---
that
 every cup, every one of the best knives and forks, and
 every empty bottle be in their place as perfect now as
 at the beginning, and
---
not one stole at all
---
said the virtuous thief, grimly.

---
did to- night afore sitting down
---
when nothing more was
 visible of the inside of the parlour
---
At this time of departure, than a thin and still
 chink of light between the shutters, a passionate scene
 was in course of enactment there."

---
though it was
 a triumph which had rather been contemplated than
 desired
---
it was
 with what Keats daintily calls a too happy happiness.

---
of whom it had ever seemed the chief component
---
better."But you have every reason to

---
" It is enough.
---
The
 facility with which even the most timid woman some-
 times acquire a relish for the dreadful when that is
 amalgamated with a little triumph,
---
is marvellous.

THE SAME NIGHT-- THE FIR PLANTATION


 AMONG the multifarious duties, was the particular one of looking
 round the homestead before going to bed, to see that
 all was right and safe for the night.
---
as any specially appointed
 officer of surveillance could have done
---
they only seem.

---
This night the buildings were inspected as usual,
 and
---
Here the
 only sounds
---
disturbing the stillness were steady munch-
 ings of many mouths, and stentorian breathings from all
 but invisible noses, ending in snores and puffs like the
 blowing of bellows slowly.
---
when the lively imagination might assist
 the eye to discern a group of pink- white nostrils,
---
until one got

---
which came within reach of their tongues
---
that these phenomena were the features and persons of
 Daisy, Whitefoot, Bonny- lass, Jolly- O, Spot, Twinkle- eye,
 etc
---
By reason of the density of the interwoven foliage
 overhead, it was gloomy there at cloudless noontide,
 twilight in the evening, dark as midnight at dusk, and
 black as the ninth plague of Egypt at midnight.
---
To
 describe the spot is.

---
the plumy ceiling of which was supported by slender
 pillars of living wood,
---
the floor being covered with a soft
 dun carpet of dead spikelets and mildewed cones, with
 a tuft of grass- blades here and there
---
This bit of the path was always the crux of the
 night's ramble, though, before starting,
---
It was certainly a
 rustle of footsteps.
---
The noise approached,
---
The instantaneous check nearly threw Bath-
.
---
We have got hitched together somehow
---
" Yes."
" A lady, I should have said."
" It does n't matter."

---
" Is that a dark lantern you have?
---
If you'll allow me
---
A hand seized the lantern
---
, the door was opened
---
the sound of a trumpet
 is
---
Gloom, the genius loci at all times hitherto,
 was now totally overthrown, less by the lantern- light
 than by what the lantern lighted.
---
It was immediately apparent.
---
The unfastening was not such a trifling affair.
---
The
 rowel of the spur had so wound itself among the gimp
 cords in those few moments,.

---
that separation was likely
 to be a matter of time
---
the lantern standing on the
 ground betwixt them threw the gleam from its open side
 among the fir- tree needles and the blades of long damp
 grass with the effect of a large glowworm.
---
It radiated
 upwards into their faces, and.

---
till it wasted to nothing
---
You are a prisoner
---
said the soldier, drily.
---
if you are in such a hurry
---
" I must cut your dress
."
" It would n't be necessary," and
---
if you could wait a
 moment
---
it nevertheless seemed
.
---
said the young sergeant, without ceremony.

---
you had never shown
 yourself to me by intruding here
---
" O,' tis shameful of you; you have been making
 it worse on purpose to keep me here
---
-- you have!"

---
" said the sergeant, with a
 merry twinkle.

---
you have
---
even when' tis thrown to me like
 a bone to a dog
---
" I tell you!" I insist upon undoing it." Certainly, miss; I am not of steel."" I am
 thankful for beauty,. These moments will be over too
 soon!"

---
The
 thought was too dreadful.
---
" All in good time; it will soon be done
---
" Who are you, then, despise opinion?"

---
who can so well afford to

---
There! it is undone at last
---
--, you see.

---
Your light fingers were more eager than mine.
---
it
 had been the knot of knots,
---
which there's no untying
---
This was worse and worse.
---
reaching a distance of
 twenty or thirty yards, turned about, and
---
really it might be
 Sergeant Troy home on furlough,.
---
" Yes; that's the name.
---
who might have

---
which is a great deal
---
" Which is a great deal more.
---
Is it true?"

---
it was

---
Learnt all languages; and said; but.
---
as it was

---
such a blessing it
 is
---
to be high- born; nobility of blood will shine out even
 in the ranks and files.
---
they
 want; and.
---
which is often,,
---
when they want to

---
which is sometimes
---
when they want
 no nonsense, which is seldom
---
Moreover, by chance or by devilry, the
 ministrant was antecedently made interesting by being
 a handsome stranger who had evidently seen better
 days.

---
that projection of consciousness into days
 gone by and,,
---
which makes the past a synonym
 for the pathetic and the future a word for circum-
 spection
---
For it may be argued with great plausibility
.

---
that reminiscence is less an endowment than a disease,
 and
---
that expectation in its only comfortable form-- that
 of absolute faith-- is practically an impossibility;
---
whilst
 in the form of hope and the secondary compounds,
 patience, impatience, resolve, curiosity, it is a constant
 fluctuation between pleasure and pain
---
To
 set against this negative gain there may have been
 some positive losses from a certain narrowing of the
 higher tastes and sensations which it entailed.
---
But
 limitation of the capacity is never recognized as a loss
 by the loser therefrom:  in this attribute.
---
moral or
 aesthetic poverty contrasts plausibly with material, whilst those who mind
 it soon cease to suffer
---
who suffer
---
since
 those do not mind it,
---
It is not a denial of anything
; but,
---
that what sober people missed
---
the possibility of the
 favour gained being transitory had reference only to
 the future
---
, disapproval of them" had.
---
fre-
 quently been tempered with a smile
---
having separated by mutual
 consent long ago
---
it sometimes happened
---
that,
 wished, any particular deed formed a dark background
 which threw them into fine relief
---
The sergeant's
 vicious phases being the offspring of impulse, and

---
never being
 based upon any original choice of foundation or direc-
 tion, they were exercised on whatever object chance

---
because that-was
 spontaneous
---
being without the power to combine them,
 the comprehension became whilst waiting for the will to direct it, and
---
the force
 wasted itself in useless grooves through unheeding the
 comprehension.

---
that they are Christians and the like,
 without thinking much of the enormous corollaries
 which spring from the proposition
---
Still less is it acted
 upon for the good of the complemental being alluded
 to.
---
With the majority such an opinion is shelved with
 all those trite aphorisms which require some catastrophe
 to bring their tremendous meanings thoroughly home.

---
When expressed with some amount of reflectiveness it
 seems co- ordinate with a belief that this flattery must
 be reasonable to be effective.
---
it is for their happiness, perhaps,.
---
that accident
 has never settled it for them
---
Nevertheless, that a
 male dissembler, is a truth taught
 to many by unsought and wringing occurrences.
---
There was no third method.

---
They consisted in about equal proportions
 of gnarled and flexuous forms,.
---
who wore tilt bonnets

---
which hung in a curtain upon
 their shoulders
---
they were

---
It was the gallant sergeant, who had come hay-
 making for pleasure; and
---
nobody could deny.

---
it was you

" Little did I think I was
 And yet, if I had reflected,
 the" Queen of the Corn- market"( truth is truth at any
 hour of the day or night, and the" Queen of the Corn- market."

---
you so named in
 Casterbridge yesterday
---
having been
 led by my feelings
---
The sergeant looked hurt and sad."
---
" Why could you
 think such a thing necessary?"

---
you must own that; and the least I could say--
 that I own myself
---
" There is some talk I could do without more easily
 than money."
"
---
That remark is a sort of digression."

---
It means."

---
that the assistance render-
 ing forbade a harsh repulse
---
there is a praise
 which is rudeness
---
that may be mine.
---
At the
 same time there is a treatment which is injustice, and

---
that may be yours.
---
who
 has never been taught concealment
---
" Indeed there's no such case between us."
---
strangers to be bold and
 impudent-- even in praise of me
---
" Ah-- it is not the fact but the method which offends
 you."
---
Would you have had

---
me look at you, and?

---
if they come near you
---
It is all pretence--
---
" what you are saying!
---
" You have a rare invention, Sergeant
 Troy.
---
Why could n't you have passed by me that
 night, and
---
that was all I meant to
 reproach you for."

---
a feeling lies in being able to express it on the spur of
 the moment, and
---
It would have been
 just the same
---
if you had been the reverse person-- ugly
 and old
---
" How long is it?"

---
since you have been so afflicted with
 strong feeling, then
---
you
 speak of
---
"' Tis to be hoped your sense of the difference does n't stop at faces, but."

---
if you pretty women had n't made
 me an idolater
---
" But-- Miss Everdene-- you do forgive me?"
" Hardly."

---
" Why?"
" You say such things."

---
you were beautiful
---
; for,
 by--  so you are!
---
" I said, and I'll say so still I saw, may I fall dead this instant! I wo n't listen to you-- you are so
 profane!"
---
There's nothing remarkable in my saying so
---
surely it is honest, and
---
why ca n't it be ex-

---
Because it-- it is n't a correct one."
---
" Well, it does n't seem quite true to me.
---
that, if
 so, it is owing to your modesty, Miss Everdene
---
But
 surely you must have been told by everybody of what
 everybody notices? and
---
you should take their words
 for it."

---
" They do n't say so exactly."

---
" O yes, they must!"

---
as you do
---
But you know?"

---
they think so
---
they do
---
that was the purport of the simple
 reply, guarded as it was-- capitulation, unknown to her-
 self.
---
Never did a fragile tailless sentence convey a
 more perfect meaning.
---
probably too the devil smiled from
 a loop- hole in Tophet,.
---
which was
---
that the seed to lift the foundation
 had taken root in the chink
---
the remainder was a mere
 question of time and natural changes.

---
" There the truth comes out!."
---
" said the soldier, in
 reply
---
that a young lady can live in a
 buzz of admiration without knowing something about it
---
, you are--
---
-- you are rather an injury to our race than other-
 wise.

---
" O, it is true enough.
---
it will do for a rough soldier), and
---
Why,
 Miss Everdene, it is in this manner.
---
that your good
 looks may do more
---
The sergeant looked down the mead in critical abstrac-
 ion."
---
you can only marry one of that many.
---
Out of these
 say.
---
twenty will endeavour to
---
because they have no ambition apart from
 their attachment to you; twenty more-- the susceptible
 person myself possibly among them--
---
where they may just see
 you,
---
The rest may try.
---
they might have married
---
There's my tale.
---
That's
---
Do you read
 French
---
there's a proverb they have,
---
" Qui aime bien chatie
---
who loves well
---
Do you understand
 me?

---
if you can

---
as you can talk
---
;" only fight half as winningly, you are
 able to make a pleasure of a bayonet wound!"
---
you do not
---
you deserve
---
you need
---
give the admiration without adding the
 warning, it stands to reason that my poor
 rough- and- ready mixture of praise and blame can not
 convey much pleasure
---
because its vigour was overwhelming
---
Still, there might have been some self-
 conceit in my foolish supposition the other night.
---
that might be an
 opinion too often forced upon you to give any pleasure

---
that the kindness of your
 nature might prevent
---
you judging an uncontrolled
 tongue harshly--
---
which you have done-- and
---
what I said in admiration but I certainly did think when I
 am working hard."
" Well, you need not think more of that
---
: perhaps you
 did not mean
---
you did not
---
you do n't
 speak to me again in that way, or
---
That is to hard!"

---
" No, it is n't.
---
Why is it?"

---
" You will never speak to me;.
---
And yet you take away the one
 little ewe- lamb of pleasure that I have in this dull life
 of mine.
---
When are you going from here
---
" But how can it give you pleasure to speak to me?"

---
as you do
 
---
what my offence is based on
---
But you ca n't really care for a
 word from me?
---
you only say so--
---
you only
 say so
---
" that's unjust-- but
---
" Then you know nothing of what such an experience
 is like-- and
---
Heaven forbid!"

---
that you ever should
---
What is it like?
---
" Put shortly, it is not being able to think, hear, or
 look in any direction except one without wretchedness,
 nor there without torture."

---
, it wo n't do--
---
" Ah, sergeant you are pretending!
---
Your words are too dashing
."

---
"" But why is it so?
---
Because you are so distracting-- and
---
" You look like it."

---
" Why, you only saw me the other night!"

---
" That makes no difference.
---
The lightning works in-
 stantaneously.
---
" You can not and
---
you don"t.
---
" There is- no such sudden feeling in people.
---
what
 o'clock it is
---
" What, have n't you a watch
---
You shall be given one.
---
Yes-- you  shall.

---
" That watch has a history.

---
" What do you see?
---
" It's the motto
 of the Earls of Severn.
---
That watch belonged to the
 last lord, and.
---
when it was

---
It was all the fortune.
---
That watch has regulated imperial interests
 in its time-- the stately ceremonial, the courtly assigna-
 tion, pompous travels, and.
---
Now it is
 yours.

---
What are you doing?
---
The sergeant retreated.

---
" Keep it-- do, Miss Everdene-- keep it!" said the
 erratic child of impulse.
---
" The fact of your possessing
 it makes it worth ten times as much to me.
---
A more
 plebeian one will answer my purpose just as well, and

---
the pleasure of knowing whose heart my old one beats
 against-- well, I wo n't speak of that.
---
It is in far
 worthier hands than ever."

---
it has been in before
---
O, how can you do such a thing
---
;
 that is!
---
if you really mean it
---
That's."
---
said the sergeant, with
 an intonation of such exquisite fidelity to nature that it.

---
whilst it had been quiescent
---
Can
 it be
---
O, how can it be,,!
---
that you care for me, and
 so suddenly
---
You have seen so little of me
---
Believe me, your generosity is too great.
---
why should you
 be so kind to me?"

---
it was again suspended, and
---
The truth was,.
---
" And my workfolk see me about the
 field, and.
---
O, this is dreadful!"
---
you to accept it at first, for it
 as my one poor patent of nobility
---
you would now
---
But you are too
 lovely even to care to be."

---
kind as others are
---
" No, no; don"t say so!
---
it be
---
it be
---
And
 will you speak to me for these few weeks of my stay?
---
O,
 did you come and!"

---
Such things have happened.
---
Well, will you let me
 work in your fields?"
---
Her
 heart erratically flitting hither and thither from per-
 plexed excitement, hot, and almost tearful
---
What
 does it mean!

HIVING THE BEES


 THE Weatherbury bees were late in their swarming this
 year.
---
Not only
 were they late this year, but unruly.
---
all the swarms would alight on the
 lowest attainable bough-- such as part of a currant- bush
 or espalier apple- tree
---
Sometimes through-
 out a whole season; next year they would, with just
 the same unanimity, make straight off to the uppermost
 member of some tall, gaunt costard, or quarrenden,
 and there defy all invaders who did not come armed
 with ladders and staves to take them.

---
This was the case at present.
---
shaded by one hand
---
till
 they ultimately halted by one of the unwieldy trees

---
A process somewhat analogous to that of
 alleged formations of the universe, time and times ago,
 was observable.
---
The bustling swarm had swept the sky
 in a scattered and uniform haze, which now thickened to
 a nebulous centre
---
: this glided on to a bough and.

---
till it formed a solid black spot upon the
 light
---
me assist you

; you should not
 attempt such a thing alone."

---
will
 you shake them in for me?
---
" But you must have on the veil and gloves, or
---
you'll
 be stung fearfully!"

---
I must put on the veil and gloves. Will
 you kindly show me?"

---
" And you must have the broad- brimmed hat, too, for

---
your cap has no brim to keep the veil off, and
---
they'd
 reach your face.
---
So a whimsical fate ordered
---
veil and all attached-- and
---
Then the veil had
---
When the manoeuvre was complete

---
Would you be good enough to
 untie me and let me out?
---
that you spoke of
---
" Ah! would you like to?
---
who had

yard returned with accounts of its being the most
 flashing affair conceivable; accoutrements and weapons
 glistening like stars- here, there, around- yet all by rule
 and compass.

---
Now, will you
 do this?"

---
" Surely you might?
---
Nobody would know."

---
why you want

---
that something more made
---
" It will not take five minutes."
---
the ferns with its long, luxuriant rays, a soft brushing-
 by of garments might have been heard among them,
 and
---
It disappeared on the other
 side.

---
you rustling through the fern
---
The pit was a saucer- shaped concave,
---
the sunshine to reach their
 heads
---
Standing in the centre, the sky overhead was
 met by a circular horizon of fern: 
---
this grew nearly to
 the bottom of the slope and
---
The
 middle within the belt of verdure was floored with a
 thick flossy carpet of moss and grass intermingled, so

---
that the foot was
---
which,, gleamed a sort of greeting,
 like a living thing
---
" first, we have four right and four
 left cuts; four right and four left thrusts
---
guards are more interesting than ours, to my mind;
 but
---
they are not.
---
They have seven cuts
 and three thrusts.
---
Well,
 next, our cut one is so."
---
as if you were sowing your corn--

---
as if
 you were hedging
---
as if you were reaping
 
---
The thrusts are these:  one,
 two, three, four, right; one, two, three, four, left."
---
your ones and
 threes are terrible!"

---
Then there's pursuing practice, in
 this way."
---
" There,
 those are the stereotyped forms.
---
The infantry have
 two most diabolical upward cuts, which we are too
 humane to use.
---
" They are rather deathy.
---
you see some loose play
---
You are
 my antagonist, with this difference from real warfare,
.
---
you do n't flinch,."

---
whatever you
 do
---
me do
---
the next thing was.
---
All was as quick as electricity.

---
Have you run me through?
---
-- no, you have
 not!
---
Whatever have you done!"

---
" It
 was mere sleight of hand.
---
The sword passed behind
 you.
---
Now you are not afraid
---
, are you?
---
if
 you are
---
Because l ca n't perform.
---
You are quite sure you
 will not hurt me?"

---
" Is the sWord very sharp?"

---
" O no-- only stand as still as a statue.
---
which seemed
 everywhere at once
---
Never since the broadsword became the national
 weapon
---
that had it been
 possible for the edge of the sword to leave in the air a
 permanent substance wherever it flew past,
---
covered by its motions
---
The
 hissing of the sword had ceased, and
---
That outer loose lock of hair wants
---
The lock droped to the ground.

---
" You did n't flinch a
 shade's thickness.
---
" It was.
---
O, you have

---
It appeared.
---
that a caterpillar had come from the
 fern and
---
There it is
---
", look." said the sargeant,.

---
The caterpillar was spitted upon its point.

---
" Why, it is magic!"
---
where the caterpillar was, and instead of running
 you
---
" But how could you chop off a curl of my hair with
 a sword that has no edge?"

---
This sword will shave like a razor.

---
then, lifting it, showed her a thin shaving of scarf-
 skin dangling therefrom.

---
" But you said before beginning that it was blunt and
 could n't cut me!"

---
" That was, and.
---
you to stand still
---
The risk of injuring you through your
 moving was too great not to force me to tell you a
 fib to escape it."

---
" I have been within an inch of my
 life, and!"
" More precisely speaking, you have been within half
 an inch of being pared alive two hundred and ninety- five
 tinies."

---
" You have been perfectly safe, nevertheless.
---
My
 sword never errs."
---
, overcome by a hundred tumultuous feel-
 ings resulting from the scene
---
like a brand swiftly waved
---
as did that of Moses in Horeh, in
 a liquid stream-- here a stream of tears
---
WE now see.
---
Introduced as lymph on the
 dart of Eros, it eventually permeated and.
---
Weakness is doubly weak by being new.

---
that world of daylight coteries and green carpets
 wherein cattle form the passing crowd and
---
, they would
 only have amounted to such a matter
---
though warm as
 summer it was fresh as spring.
---
whose
 vertues were as metals in a mine
---
which
 nearly obscured it
---
It was a result which paralleled
 the oft- quoted observation of Hippocrates concerning
 physical pains.

---
That is a noble.
---
It was dusk.

---
who had not
 been far a- field that day
---
The wheat was now tall, and
---
the path was narrow
---
;
 thus the way was quite a sunken groove between the
 embowing thicket on either side.
---
Two persons could
 not walk abreast without damaging the crop, and
---
" You are taking a
 walk too.
---
as it is rather
 late
---
" O no; but there are bad characters about."

---
all at once the scheme broke
 down
---
that this was rather a
 clumsy way, and too barefaced to begin with

who would naturally come

what you meant

For-
 give my speaking plainly."

" They say."

what is not true

 the moment had come

what people say

Since this subject has been mentioned.

the answer will be."

" People are full of mistakes, seemingly."

" They are."

you almost proved

that you were not

 have said, and."

that you be not

They do, but

you had

" Did any one tell you?"

what is mirth to the neighbours

 you see

that has come to the dogs

" The reason of that is.

It was not only received with utter incredulity as re-

Are ye not more to me than my own affairs, and
 even life!

before it is too late

you to go elsewhere

a
 paleness of face invisible to the eye being suggested by
 the trembling words
---
" That's nonsense."

" This is the
 second time you have pretended to dismiss me; and

---
what's the use
---
You shall go, sir-- your lecturing I
!
---
" Go, indeed-- what folly will you say next?
---
when you know
---
that a
 short time ago my position was as good as yours
---
Upon
 my life, Bathsheba, it is too barefaced.
---
You know, too,

---
you would n't get out of I
---
Unless, indeed,
 you'll promise.

" Very well, then; you should be thankful to me for
 biding.

How would the farm go on with nobody to
 mind it but a woman?

" ee to feel
---
you owe me anything

your concerns going,

as they
 must if you keep in this mind....

But
 you know well enough how it is, and
---
It is more than probable.

" Will you leave me alone now?

you not to be so uncourteous as to refuse

that the request should have come at this
 moment,, and
---
for the strife was over

they were on a
 most desolate hill, far from every human habitation, and

---
the hour was getting late
---
that
 the little gallery door alluded
---
it stood, and.
---
The pale lustre yet hanging
 in the north- western heaven
---
was sufficient to show that
 a sprig of ivy had grown from the wall across the door
 to a length of more than a foot, delicately tying the
 panel to the stone jamb.
---
which did not come to light till a long time
---
It was impossible;

---
as it were

A dialogue was going
 on in the kitchen, and

" Twill be a gallant life, but

 redundance of speech to leave alone it died the natural death of unminded things.

There was a pause.

before anybody replied

What was passing

was a bit of a
 word about yourself,

You

We know

you do

 all."

said Maryann.

---
How can you
 speak that wicked story!

, you did.
---
Yes, Maryann, you know it!"

---
so did you.
---
How dare you to my face!

---
What is it to me?

---
You know.
---
it is nothing
---
you'll be dismissed
 instantly
---
you do n't now
---
People always
 say such foolery,
---
O Liddy, are you such a
 simpleton
---
Ca n't you read riddles?
---
Ca n't you see?

---
" Yes; you must be a blind thing, Liddy!"

"; it is wearing me away!
---
Do n't you yet know
 enough of me?
---
O God, what a lie it was!

Heaven and my
 Love forgive me.

And do n't you know?

who loves at all

when it is

---
that it is all lies

" You graceless

How can you have the cruel
 heart to repeat what they say?

that
 you are

But I'LL see!"
---
if you or anybody else in the
 village, or town either, dare do such a thing

it is not true

you only agree with me like that to please
 me

Do you

" And you do n't believe?"

you don"t

you do n't believe it

 you inside this closed door

" No, no, Liddy; you must stay!".

" You must not notice my being in a
 taking just now.

You are not as a servant

all was smooth
 again.

" And, dear miss, you won"t harry me and storm at
 me

because you seem, and

it frightens me!

Do you know,

when you are in one

---
" Never! do you?"
---
that' tis getting on that way sometimes
---
who was married to a thriving hurdler
 and cattle- crib- maker living in a delightful labyrinth of
 hazel copse not far beyond Yalbury
---
The arrangement
 was
---
that they were
---
everything carefully locked up for

---
Freshness was exhaled in an essence
 from the varied contours of bank and hollow,; and
---
as if the
 earth breathed maiden breath
---
the pleased birds
 were hymning to the scene.
---
how the day was retreating
---
how
 the time of deeds was quietly melting into the time of
 thought,,
---
even when it involves
 another person's possible blight
---
But the argument now came
 back as sorry gleams from a broken mirror.
---
The dis-
 covery was no less a scourge than a surprise.

---
till they were less than a stone's throw
 apart
---
" Oh; is it you, Mr. Boldwood?
---
who have the power of reproaching in silence

---
Those may find.
---
it a means more effective than words
---
There
 are accents in the eye which are not on the tongue, and

---
more tales come from pale lips.

---
It is both the grandeur and the pain of the remoter
 moods.
---
that they avoid the pathway of sound
---
wood's look was unanswerable.

---
What, are
 you afraid of me
---
Why should you say that
---
you looked so
---
And it is most
 strange, because of its contrast with my feeling for you.

---
You know.
---
what that feeling is
---
No dismissal
 by a hasty letter affects that.
---
you did not feel so strongly about me
---
" It is generous of you, and more than I
 deserve, but
---
What do you think?

---
that's enough.
---
Your letter
 was excellently plain.
---
you to hear nothing--
 not I."

---
" Indeed it is."

---
you knew
---
what is in
 me of devotion to you
---
it is impossible, that.
---
But there was a time when you turned to me,
!
---
if you had not attracted me
 by that letter
---
you call it
---
that the ignorant and cold darkness
-- valentine-- would have been
 worse than my knowledge of you,
---
though it has brought
 this misery
---
But,, there was a time when I knew
 nothing of you, and cared nothing for you, and
---
yet you
 drew me on.
---
if you say
---
you gave me no en-

---
What you call encouragement
---
" was the childish
 game of an idle minute.
---
Can you still go on re-
?"

---
what you insist
---
was jest, and
---
you say
---
Our
 moods meet at wrong places.
---
your feeling was
 more like mine, or
---
that trifling trick
 was going
---
But it is weak, idle
 drivelling to go on like this....
---
it is.
---
that makes this denial so hard
 to bear
---
How nearly you promised me!
---
you grieve

---
to move your heart make because of my pain; it is no use, that.
---
;
 my pain would get no less by paining you."

---
Your dear
 love, Bathsheba, is such a vast thing beside your pity,
.
---
that the loss of your pity as well as your love is no great
 addition to my sorrow, nor
---
O sweet-- how dearly you
 spoke to me behind the spear- bed at the washing- pool,
 and in the barn at the shearing, and that dearest last
 time in the evening at your home!
---
Where are your
 pleasant words all gone--?
---
your earnest hope to be able
 to love me
---
Where is your firm conviction that you
 would get to care for me very much?
---
if l would not be
---
Yet each of those
 pleasures was just for the day-- the day just for the
 pleasure.
---
One
 thing is sure
---
: you were all but mine, and
---
now you are
 not nearly mine.
---
Everything is changed, and
---
You were nothing to me once,
 and
---
; you are now nothing to me again,
 and!

---
how different the second nothing is from the first
---
Would to God you had never taken me up,!"

---
since it was

---
if you will only tell it me gently
---
O sir,
 will you not kindly forgive me, and?"

---
Heavens you must be
 heartless quite!
---
what a fearfully bitter
 sweet this was
---
what do you care!
---
You do n't care."

as they came

that you have

---
as it was
---
that
 you only wrote
---
that refusal to me in fun-- come
---
" It would be untrue, and painful to both of us.
---
You
 overrate my capacity for love.
---
An un-
 protected childhood in a cold world has beaten gentle-
 ness out of me."

---
That
 may be true, somewhat; but
---
ah, Miss Everdene, it wo n't
 do as a reason!
---
It is n't.
---
because you
 have no feeling in you
---
that you do n't love me
---
You
 naturally would have
---
me think so
---
-- you would hide from
.
---
that you have a burning heart like mine
---
You have

---
what had occurred
---
your inclination was
---
Can you deny it--
---
can
 you deny it
---
you can not
---
when nobody would have been
---
-- when nobody
 would have been set tale- bearing.

Now the people
 sneer at me--

the very hills and sky seem.

they'll say, Miserable love- sick man

the dishonour not known, and

my position
 kept!

But no matter, it is gone, and

you knew
---
" All the time-- how very well you knew--

---
that your new freak was my misery
---
Dazzled by brass
 and scarlet-- O, Bathsheba
---
You are taking too much
 upon yourself!
---
" Everybody is
 upon me -- everybody.
---
It is unmanly!
---
no mercy is shown.
---
if a
 thousand of you sneer and
---
Do you hear

me go on

" Ha" came hoarsely from the farmer.

---
" given worlds to touch your hand, you have let in without right or ceremony and!

Heaven's
 mercy-- kiss you!...

The
 impending night appeared.

", that will I!
---
sheba, sweet, lost coquette, pardon me!
---
who had been standing motionless as a
 model all this latter time
---
which
 had just passed away
---
The
 least spark would kindle the farmer's swift feelings of rage
 and jealousy
---
; it might
 take the direction of derision, and
---
But now there was no reserve.

Amaranthine glosses came over them then,
 and

HORSES TRAMPING



---
THE village of Weatherbury was quiet as the graveyard
 in its midst, and
---
the living were lying well nigh as still
 as the dead.
---
The church clock struck eleven.
---
The
 air was so empty of other sounds that the whirr of the
 clock- work immediately before the strokes was distinct,
 and
---
The notes flew forth with the usual blind obtuseness
 of inanimate things--,.

---
after eleven had struck
---
It led to a dream, and the dream to an
 awakening, with an uneasy sensation that something
 had happened.
---
The paddock abutted on this end of the
 building, and
---
The figure seized the
 horse by the forelock, and.
---
Two varieties only of humanity could have entered
 the paddock with the ghostlike glide of that mysterious
 figure.
---
Moreover, to
 raise suspicion to conviction itself, there were gipsies in!

---
who had been afraid to shout in the robber's
 presence
---
together they went to the paddock.
---
the horse was gone.

---
They listened.
---
Distinct upon the stagnant air came
 the sounds of a trotting horse passing up Longpuddle
 Lane-- just beyond the gipsies' encampment in Weather-
 bury Bottom.

---
That's.
---
it had happened
---
" How I
 wish, and none
 of us had been answerable!"

---
" We must ride after."
---
what we do
---
Yes,
 we'll follow."

---
" All our
 horses are too heavy for that trick except little Poppet,
 and
---
if we only had that
 pair over the hedge we might do something.
---
said Maryann.

---
gone for
---
" Where did you find' em?"
---
where they were kept
---
Coggan, you can ride
?
---
there's no time to look for saddles."

---
when the halters
 were dexterously slipped on
---
when they ascended to the gate and
---
taken by Bathsheha's horse and the robber
---
Whose vehicle the horse had been harnessed.

---
Weatherbury Bottom was reached in three or four
 minutes.
---
They scanned the shady green patch by the
 roadside.
---
The gipsies were gone.

---
Which way have
---
they
 gone
---
as God made little apples
---
we are
---
The road- metal grew
---
softer and more
 rain had wetted its surface to a somewhat plastic, but
 not muddy state.
---
They came to cross- roads.
---
" Which way have they
 gone, I wonder?" What's the matter?
---
" We must try,,"

---
since we ca n't hear' em
---
The rain had been
 heavier here, and
---
all foot and horse tracks made previous
 to the storm,
 and
---
blurred by the drops
---
they were now so many little scoops of water, which
 reflected the flame of the match like eyes.
---
One set of
 tracks was fresh and
---
had no water in them; one pair of
 ruts was also empty, and not small canals, like the others.

---
The footprints forming this recent impression were full
 of information as to pace
---
; they were in equidistant pairs,
 three or four feet apart,
---
the right and left foot of each
 pair being exactly opposite one another.

---
Tracks like that
 mean a stiff gallop.
---
And the horse is harnessed--
---
Ay,
" How do you know?"

---
The rest of the gipsies must ha" gone on earlier,
 or some other way."
---
" You saw?"

---
there were
 no other tracks
---
They rode along silently for a long weary
 time.
---
it now struck one.
---
The fact is,
---
they over-

---
Again they hastened on, and.
---
When they looked
 again
---
" That's a trot
---
They pushed rapidly on for yet two or three miles.

---
's see
---
Twill help us.
---
the ex-
 amination made,
" Hurrah!"
---
We shall get them in two miles,
 for a crown."

---
They rode three, and.
---
No sound was.
---
when they came
 to a turning
---
The tracks were absolutely the only guide
 as to the direction that they now had, and great caution
.

---
which had made their appearance lately
---
" What does this mean?--."
---
This time only three were of the regular horseshoe
 shape.
---
Every fourth was a dot.

---
Yes Dainty is lamed; the near- foot- afore."
---
" We'll push on."
---
Although the road along its greater part had been as
 good as any turnpike- road in the country
---
, it was nomin-
 ally only a byway.
---
The last turning had brought them
 into the high road leading to Bath.
---
' Twas said until, against a shady background of foliage,
.

---
five white bars were visible,
---
" Hush-- we are almost close!"
---
The white bars were blotted out in the midst by a
 dark shape in front of them.
---
The silence of this lonely
 time was pierced by an exclamation from that quarter.

---
It appeared
---
The
 rays illumined the whole group.

---
" Why,' tis mistress- i'll take my oath!"
---
where are you
 going
---
" We thought-- --
---
An important
 matter made it necessary for me to give up my visit to
 liddy, and go off at once.
---
, then, were you
?"

---
" We thought."

---
the horse was
---
Did n't you think?"

---
it might

---
" Why should we, miss?"

---
" Perhaps not Why, those are never Farmer Bold-

---
what have you been

---
we to know
---
if you left no account of
 your doings
---
you would have seen
 it in the morning.
---
" But you'll consider, ma'am,."

---
that we could n't see

---
that till it got daylight
---
you
 had borrowed anybody's horses but
---
Dainty is lame
---
" Can ye go
 on?"

---
Will you now return, please?"

---
fanned
 by the velvety air of this July night
---
by which they had come
---
" A strange vagary, this of hers, is n't it, Oak?"
---
we keep this night's work as quiet

---
as we can
---
We shall be home by three o'clock
---
It was a picture full of misery, but
---
that the support of a lover's arms is not of a kind best

---
It was now dark, and
---
the hour must have been nearly
 ten.
---
The scheme seemed at first impossible:

---
sheba was full of a stimulating turbulence,
---
beside which
 caution vainly prayed for a hearing.
---
till the cottagers were in bed, and, par-

---
whenever they
 chose
---
so nobody would know.

---
what initial success we
 have already seen
---
A WEEK passed, and
---
there were no tidings of Bath-
 sheba; nor.

---
Then a note came for Maryann,; but
---
The oat- harvest began, and

---
Indoors nothing was; out- of- doors the whetting of scythes
 and the hiss of tressy oat- ears rubbing together.
---
as their
 perpendicular stalks of amber- yellow fell heavily to each
 swath
---
Drought was
 everywhere else.

---
They were about to withdraw for a while into the
 charitable shade of a tree in the fence,.

" Yes, that's just it.
---
Your mouth is always open, you
 young rascal!"

---
" Well, at Bath you saw-- --
---
And bymeby they got
 closer and closer, and
---
then they went arm- in- crook, like
 courting complete-- hok- hok! like courting complete--
 hok!--
---
if ye'll excuse it
---
what ran in going the wrong way
---
which for a moment
 hung in the sunny air like a small exhalation
---
" There's a great clumsy sneeze!
---
Why ca n't ye have
 better manners, you young dog!
---
" The cider went up my nose!"
---
now' tis gone down my neck,
 and into my poor dumb felon, and over my shiny
 buttons and all my best cloze!"

---
" The poor lad's cough is terrible unfortunate."
---
said
 Matthew Moon.
---
when my feelings were worked
 up to a point
---
The Balls
 were always a very excitable family.
---
But
 we be born to things
---
-- that's true.
---
; though, perhaps, a high nater is a
 little high, and
---
at my birth all things were possible to
 my Maker, and
---
Yet there is a Sermon on the
 Mount with a calendar of the blessed at the head, and

---
said
 Matthew Moon."
---
You know'em, Jan?
---
A Quarrenden grafted on
 a Tom Putt, and a Rathe- ripe upon top o' that again.

---
" what did you
 see, Cain
---
our mis'ess go into a sort of a park place
---
where there's seats, and shrubs and flowers, arm- in- crook
 with a sojer
---
And they sat there together for more
 than half- an- hour,, and
---
when they came out

---
they looked into one another's faces,."

---
Well,
 what did you see besides?
---
What will ye say next
---
that the sky and the earth in the
 kingdom of Bath is not altogether different from ours
 here
---
" And the people of Bath." continued Cain," never
 need."

---
testified Matthew Moon.
---
other navigators say the same thing
---
" They drink nothing else there."
---
how they swaller it down
---
" Well, it seems a barbarian practice enough to us,
 but
---
the natives think nothing o' it
---
said
 Matthew.

---
God did n't provide'em with victuals as well as(-
 and
---
" No- i own to a blot there in Bath-- a true blot.
 I could n't get over at all observed
 Moon;" and
---
it must be a curious people that live
 therein."

---
, you say?
---
that would have stood
 alone' ithout legs inside
---
And how handsome they looked.
---
You
 could see'em all the length of the street."

---
that were all but blue- mouldy,
---
But that's nothing to do with mistress!"

---
if you'll leave me alone, Mister
 Oak
---
If you excites me
---
,
 perhaps you'll bring on my cough, and
---
there were great large houses, and more
 people all the week long than at Weatherbury club-
 walking on White Tuesdays
---
And how the parson would pray!

---
" Our poor Parson Thirdly ca n't get no money to

---
buy such rings.
---
" said  Matthew Moon, thoughtfully.

---
how unequal things be
---
Well, that's enough of this.

---
" Oh-- and the new style of parsons wear moustaches
 and long beards."."

---
we fokes in the congregation
---
" And there's two religions going on in the nation
 now-- High Church and High Chapel.
---
" Well, at High Church they pray singing, and worship
 all the colours of the rainbow; and
---
at High Chapel they
 pray preaching, and worship drab and whitewash only.

---
" Why did n't you say so afore, then?
---
" Ah." said Matthew Moon,'
---
" Our
 mis'ess has too much sense under they knots of black
 hair."

---
You see
---
" can you
 swear in the most awful form
---
you saw

---
" Cain Ball, you be no longer a babe and suckling,"

---
and you know.

---
what taking an oath is
---
which you say and
 seal with your blood- stone
---
the prophet Matthew
 tells us.
---
that on whomsoever it shall fall
---
before all the work- folk here
 assembled
---
Now,, can you swear to your words?"

---
as the shep-
 herd asks ye
---
if that's

---
what you mane
---
can you
---
" You be asked, and
---
Tis you want
---
" All is!"

---
ye want

There's.
---
" Cain Ball, you'll come to a bit of bread!"
---
Then the reapers' hooks were flourished again, and

---
the old sounds went on.
---
nearly how the land lay
---
when they were in a nook
 together
---
What difference
 does it make,?"

---
" That's the very thing I say to myself."
---
A vehicle of some kind was softly creeping along
 the grassy margin of the lane.
---
The tones were natural
 and
---
The carriage came opposite and.
---
All grave
 reports were forgotten.

---
till there was no
 difference between the eastern and western expanses
 of sky, and
---
the timid hares began round the dim hillocks

" the passer said.

---
The blind was
 not drawn down, and

wood augured ill from that sign.

" My mistress can not see you, sir.

The farmer instantly went out by the gate.

-- that was the issue of it all.

It was ten
 o'clock.

---
The van ran to and from a
 town in a northern direction, and
---
it was owned and

---
The lamp fixed to the head
 of the hood illuminated a scarlet and gilded form, who
 was the first to alight.

---
But, some
 one opened the door and.
---
this
 person say" Good- night" to the inmates, and
---
" This was strange,.
---
what appeared
---
It seemed.

---
" Just arrived from up the country, I think?"Just arrived from Bath."

---
in which this word was uttered
---
The tone was all
.

---
that had been wanted

who lives just ahead there
---
you have wronged
---
you are going
---
it was
 past ten o'clock
---
It seemed worth.

---
somebody or other may overhear us in the farmhouse
 there
---
who does know it
---
You ought."

---
Previously it had had a devil- may- care
 tone.
---
It was the voice of a trickster now.

---
we sit down here
---
An old tree trunk lay under the hedge immediately
 opposite, and
---
they sat down.

---
in which this word was uttered
---
The tone was all

---
you came and-- --"
.
---
" Hang might!"Would, then."

---
If you had not come

"-- yes,
 certainly-- have been accepted by this time.

If you had

all is

" How will you?"

that you do n't suffer from poverty
 in the future

you'll
 never make for a moderate and rightful match
---
you may

you shall take
 fifty pounds with you.
---
when you have told me

---
such a scheme now engaged.
---
Where there is much bias

---
there must be some narrowness, and
---
love, though added
 emotion, is subtracted capacity.
---
that was.

---
as you say
---
" Never mind-- do you agree to my arrangement?
---
O,
 Troy,, why then did you step in here
 and?"

---
It is over now."

---
" Why should it be over so soon?
---
And why then
 did you come here again?
---
" There are weighty reasons.
---
Fifty pounds at once,
 you said!
---
here they are-- fifty
 sovereigns."
---
" You have everything ready
---
"
" I did."" and-- it seems that you
 calculated on my accepting them."
---
said the sergeant,
 taking the packet.

---
you might accept them
---
You've only my word that the programme shall be
 adhered to,."

---
" I thought."" l had thought of that, and
---
l have considered."

---
well, shrewdness we'll call it--
---
who is willing to be an extremely useful friend
---
A light pit- pat was audible upon the road just above
 them.

---
" It can do no harm-- and
---
It will help you in your love- making."

---
what has become of me
---
" Will you confine your words to that one point?
---
what you hear
---
The light footstep came closer,.
---
as if the walker listened for a sound
---
" Come to that, is it!"
---
" You promised silence."
---
" How late you are."
---
Did
 you come by the carrier?
---
it was some time ago,
 and
---
You knew I

---
" should, did you not?"

---
you would

, Frank, it is so lucky!
---
There's not a soul in my
 house but me to- night.

nobody on earth will know of your visit to your lady's
 bower.

when you'll be gone again
---
But, dear me, I. had better

because my slippers and brush and
 comb are in it

go back for my bag; you run home, and I'll
 promise to be in your parlour in ten minutes."

---
you see my dilemma
---
, you make it worth my while."

---
The move was absolutely unexpected.

---
" You are injuring her you
 love!"

---
, what do you mean?
---
" Well" said the farmer.

---
Devil,
 you torture me!"
---
It is not worth
---
Indeed it is a barbarous way of settling a quarrel.

---
would it not?
---
"' Twould be a mistake." repeated Boldwood,
 mechanically, with a bowed head.

The alternative is dreadful, but

" Here
 is the sum, and

we'll write
 out the agreement for the remainder, and the terms
 also."

---
"; at any rate informed.
---
When
 they stood at the entrance
---
In two minutes a light appeared
 in the passage.
---
that the chain
 had been fastened across the door
---
" What, did you think?
---
" Oh, no, it is merely my humour.

---
Will you read this a moment?
---
" That's the paragraph."
---
A low gurgle of derisive
 laughter followed the words.

AT AN UPPER WINDOW


 IT was very early the next morning-- a time of sun and
 dew.
---
The confused beginnings of many birds' songs
 spread into the healthy air, and
---
the wan blue of the
 heaven was here and
---
there coated with thin webs of
 incorporeal cloud which were of no effect in obscuring
 day.
---
All the lights in the scene were yellow as to
 colour, and
---
all the shadows were attenuated.

---
The creeping plants about the old manor- house were
 bowed with rows of heavy water drops, which had upon
 objects behind them the effect of minute lenses of high
 magnifying power.

---
They were yet barely in view of their
 mistress's house,.
---
they paused before emerging from its
 shade.

---
we should know something to- day
---
wheels pass my door just
 after dark
---
-- you were out."
---
how white your face is
---
; you look like a corpse!"

---
They stood by the gate awhile,.
---
Why
 had it been so mysteriously managed?
---
It had become
: .
---
that the horse had
 broken down, and
---
which appears like
 stillness
---
Just as that imperceptible motion is infinitely divided in its properties from stili

---
In a few minutes they moved on again towards the
 house.
---
The sergeant still looked from the window.

---
when they came up
---
ye going?
---
"-- you need n't spend a hapenny of meaning
 upon it, and."

---
since the deed was
 done
---
" Why-- they may not be married!"
---
The soldier turned a little
 towards the east, and
---
" But it is a nice old house."
---
My notion is."

---
that sash- windows should
 be put throughout, and
---
these old wainscoted walls
 brightened up a bit; or and

---
the walls papered
---
" It would be a pity
---
A philosopher once said in my hearing
.."
---
who worked
---
when art was a living
 thing
---
that the old builders,, had no respect for the work of builders who went
 before them, but; and
---
as they
 thought fit
---
why should n't we?"'Creation and
 preservation do n't do well together
---
a
 million of antiquarians ca n't invent a style
---
that
 we may be cheerful
---
whilst we can
---
as if inspired by a recollec-
 tion
---
" do you know
---
" It is of no importance." lightly."
---
We shall, of course, keep on just as
 friendly terms as usual.
---
However,
 what is must be, and
---
" very well- you keep it, Coggan."
---
, though you say

---
" Well- perhaps it is best; but
---
if my place
 here is
---
, my
 place must be lost
---
whom they had for some time seen in
 the distance
---
A horseman,, now appeared close beside them.

---
if they were wanted
---
they were not stood back
---
The only signs of the terrible sorrow been combating through the night, and.

---
the very step of the
 animal seemed significant of dogged despair.
---
the square figure sitting erect upon the horse,

---
the head turned to neither side, the elbows steady by
 the hips, the brim of the hat level and undisturbed in
 its onward glide,
---
who knew

---
The clash of
 discord between mood and matter here was forced
 painfully home to the heart; and,
---
as in laughter there are
 more dreadful phases than in tears, so
---
when the weather was yet dry and sultry
---
The night had a sinister aspect.
---
A heated breeze
 from the south slowly fanned the summits of lofty
 objects, and in the sky dashes of buoyant cloud were
 sailing in a course at right angles to that of another
 stratum, neither of them in the direction of the breeze
 below.
---
The moon, as seen through these films, had
 a lurid metallic look.
---
The fields were sallow with the
 impure light, and
---
all were tinged in monochrome, as
 if beheld through stained glass.
---
The same evening
 the sheep had trailed homeward head to tail
---
, the
 behaviour of the rooks had been, and
---
the
 horses had moved with timidity and caution.

---
Thunder was imminent, and,
---
taking some secondary
 appearances into consideration, it was likely to be
.
---
followed by one of the lengthened rains which mark
 the close of dry weather for the season
---
Before twelve
 hours had passed a harvest atmosphere
---
would be a
 bygone thing.

---
one
 of which stood slightly ajar, and
---
The central space, together with the recess at one
 end, was emptied of all incumbrances, and
---
this area,
 covering about two- thirds of the whole, was appropriated
 for the gathering, the remaining end, which was piled
 to the ceiling with oats, being screened off with sail-
 cloth.
---
Here sat three
 fiddlers, and
---
The dance ended, and on the black oak floor in the
 midst a new row of couples formed for another.

---
you would like next
---
" said the first violin.

---
" Really, it makes no difference."
---
" Then." said the fiddler,"
---
I'll venture that
 the right and proper thing is" The Soldier's Joy"--
--

---
there being a gallant soldier married into the farm
---
" It shall be" The Soldier's Joy,
---
So the dance began.
---
" there can not be, and.
---
that this melody, at
 the end of three- quarters of an hour of thunderous
 footing, still possesses more stimulative properties for
 the heel and toe than the majority of other dances at
 their first opening
---
The Soldier's Joy" has, too, an
 additional charm, in being so admirably adapted to
 the tambourine aforesaid-- no mean instrument in the
 hands of a performer who understands the proper
 convulsions, spasms, St. vitus's dances, and fearful
 frenzies necessary when exhibiting its tones in their
 highest perfection.

---
The immortal tune ended,
---
a fine DD rolling forth
 from the bass- viol with the sonorousness of a cannonade,
 and
---
though the others drank without exception
 cider and ale
---
" The sergeant said.

---
that a heavy rain is sure to fall
 soon, and
---
that something should be done
---
it will not rain
---
" Friends, it is not only the harvest home; but
---
that we
 are celebrating to- night
---
this is also a Wedding
 Feast.
---
not until now
 have we been able to give any public flourish to the
 event in Weatherbury.
---
That it may be
---
It will only do them
 harm:  they have had enough of everything."

---
" True-- we do n't wish for no more."
---
said
 one or two.

---
" Pooh!" said the sergeant contemptuously, and

---
as if lighted up by a new idea
---
we'll send the women- folk home
---
Tis time they were in bed.
---
Then we cockbirds will
 have a jolly carouse to ourselves!
---
them look elsewhere for a
 winter's work
---
The musicians, not
 looking upon themselves as" company." slipped quietly
 away to their spring waggon and.

---
followed by a
 friendly oath from the sergeant for not staying to a
 second round of grog
---
It was a large toad humbly travelling across
 the path.
---
it might be better

---
And soon came another.

---
as if a brush of varnish
 had been lightly dragged across it
---
During this time two black spiders, of the kind common
 in thatched houses, promenaded the ceiling, ultimately
.
---
if there
 was one class of manifestation on this matter
---
that, it was the instincts of sheep
---
They were
---
But this was not the most noteworthy
 feature
---
:  they were all grouped in such a way that their
 tails, without a single exception, were towards that half
 of the horizon from which the storm threatened.
---
There
 was an inner circle closely huddled, and
---
outside these
 they radiated wider apart,.
---
formed by the
 flock as a whole
---
the pattern not being unlike a vandyked lace
 collar, to which the clump of furze- bushes stood in the
 position of a wearer's neck.
 opinion
---
Every voice in nature was unanimous
 in bespeaking change.
---
Apparently there
 was.
---
The creeping things seemed;.

---
whilst the sheep knew all about the
 thunder- storm and nothing of the later rain
---
This complication of weathers being uncommon,
 was all the more to be feared.
---
All was silent here, and the conical tips of
 the ricks jutted darkly into the sky.
---
There were five
 wheat- ricks in this yard, and three stacks of barley.

---
The wheat when threshed would average about thirty
 quarters to each stack; the barley, at least forty.
---
mentally estimated by the following simple calcula-
 tion: 
---
750 L.
 Seven hundred and fifty pounds in the divinest form
 that money can wear--!"

---
It is possible
---
that there was this golden legend under
 the utilitarian one
---
All
 was silent within, and
---
The candles suspended among the evergreens.
---
in some cases the
 leaves tied about them
---
Many of the
 lights had quite gone out
---
, others smoked and grease dropping from them upon the floor.
---
Here,
 under the table, and leaning against forms and chairs
 in every conceivable attitude except the perpendicular,!"
 were the wretched persons of all the work- folk, the hair
 of their heads at such low levels being suggestive of
 mops and brooms.
---
The glasses and cups still stood upon the table,

---
a water- jug being overturned, from which a small rill,
 after tracing its course with marvellous precision down
 the centre of the long table
---
if the ricks
 were, or even the next morning
---
The shaking was without effect.

---
where's your thatching-
 beetle and rick- stick and spars
---
" said Moon,
---
it dropped upon the
 floor like a bowl.
---
" where's the key of the granary?"

---
The question was repeated, with the
 same result.
---
that drinking should be
 the bond of their union, that those who wished to refuse
 hardly liked to be so unmannerly under the circum-
 stances
---
Having from their youth up been entirely un-
 accustomed to any liquor stronger than cider or mild
 ale
---
, it was no wonder that they had succumbed, one
 and all, with extraordinary uniformity, after the lapse of
 about an hour.

---
that the barn might
 not be endangered
---
while directly opposite in
 the north rose a grim misshapen body of cloud, in the
 very teeth of the wind
---
So unnaturally did it rise.

---
that
 one could fancy it
---
to be lifted by machinery from below
---
Meanwhile the faint cloudlets had flown back into the
 south- east corner of the sky, as if in terror of the large
 cloud, like a young brood gazed in upon by some
 monster.

---
nobody stirred.
---
" Is that you?
---
" said Mrs. Susan Tall, half awake.

---
you drawlatching rogue--

---
in the name of fortune did you
 pretend?"

---
you meant
---
" Yes you did
---
what do you want here?
---
People coming
--"

---
soon two of these
 heaps of treasure in grain were covered snug-- two cloths
 to each.
---
Two hundred pounds were secured.
---
Three
 wheat- stacks remained open, and
---
there were no more
 cloths.
---
So far all was well.
---
that there was not
 much wind
---
Next came the barley.
---
This it was only possible.
---
Time went on, and

---
the moon vanished.
---
It was the
 farewell of the ambassador previous to war.
---
The
 night had a haggard look, like a sick thing; and
---
which might have
 been likened to a death
---
And now nothing was heard
 in the yard but the dull thuds of the beetle which drove
 in the spars, and the rustle of thatch in the intervals.





---
A LIGHT flapped over the scene,.
---
It was the first move of the approaching
 storm.

---
The second peal was noisy, with comparatively little
 visible lightning.
---
soon a shadow swept to and fro
 upon the blind.

---
Then there came a third flash.
---
Manoeuvres of a
 most extraordinary kind were going on in the vast
 firmamental hollows overhead.
---
The lightning now was
 the colour of silver, and.
---
Rumbles became rattles.
---
Every hedge, bush,
 and tree was distinct as in a line engraving.
---
the forms of these were visible at this moment in
 the act of galloping about in the wildest and maddest
 confusion, flinging their heels and tails high into the air,
 their heads to earth.
---
A poplar in the immediate fore-
 ground was like an ink stroke on burnished tin.
---
Then
 the picture vanished,.

---
as it was
 indifferently called
---
It was the fourth of the larger flashes.
---
there was a smack-- smart, clear, and short,

---
Not a drop of rain had fallen as yet.
---
urgent labour could not be carried on without
 such risk?
---
The spike attached to it
---
It was green as an
 emerald, and
---
the reverberation was stunning.
---
What
 was this
---
The form moved on a step:

---
" Is that you, ma'am?
---
are you?
---
The weather awoke me, and
---
-- can we save it
---
" Do you know?"

---
that the stacks should be seen to
---
now they are all neglected!
---
Can I do anything
? Surely I can do something?"
" You can bring up some reed- sheaves to me, one by
 one, ma'am; if you are not afraid to come up the ladder
 in the dark."
---
" Every moment is precious
 now, and
---
that would save a good deal of time.
---
It is
 not very dark."

---
when the lightning has been gone a bit
---
The rick
 lost its sheen
---
-- the shapes vanished.
---
Then came the peal.
---
It hardly was credible.

---
that
 such a heavenly light could be the parent of such a
 diabolical sound
---
At the same moment,
, there was
 more light, and
---
as it were
---
It was the shadow of that tree, thrown across
 by a secondary flash in the west.

---
The next flare came.
---
There was then a silence everywhere
 for four or five minutes, and the crunch of the spars,

---
the crisis of the storm had passed
---
But there came a burst of light.

---
Heaven opened then, indeed.
---
The flash was almost
 too novel for its inexpressibly dangerous nature to be
, and
---
they could only comprehend the
 magnificence of its beauty.
---
It sprang from east, west,
 north, south, and.
---
The
 forms of skeletons appeared in the air,.
---
With these were intertwined, and
---
what may be called a shout
---
though no shout
 ever came near it
---
since,, it was more of the nature of a shout
 than of anything else earthly.
---
love, life,
 everything human, seemed small and trifling in such
 close juxtaposition with an infuriated universe.

---
It was a stupefying
 blast, harsh and pitiless, and
---
it fell upon their ears in a
 dead, flat blow, without that reverberation which lends
 the tones of a drum to more distant thunder.
---
that the tree was
 sliced down the whole length of its tall, straight stem, a
 huge riband of bark
---
The
 other portion remained erect, and.
---
The
 lightning had struck the tree.
---
A sulphurous smell
 filled the air
---
; then all was silent, and black as a cave
 in Hinnom.

---
" We had a narrow escape!
---
" You had better go down."

---
The darkness was now impenetrable by
 the sharpest vision.
---
They both stood still at the
 bottom, side by side.
---
" The storm seems
---
Though there
 are multitudes of gleams
---
The sky was now filled with an incessant light,
 frequent repetition melting into complete continuity, as
 an unbroken sound results from the successive strokes
 on a gong.

---
" no rain falling.
---
But Heaven be praised
---
, it is all the
 better for us.
---
I can not understand
 I am now going up again."
" Gabriel, you are kinder than I deserve!
---
I will stay
 and. O, why are not some of the others
 here!"

---
" They would have been here."
---
if they could
---
" They are all asleep in the barn, in a drunken sleep, and
 my husband among them
---
That's it
---
, is it not?
---
All was in
 total darkness,, and
---
there still arose, as
 at the former time, the steady buzz of many snores.

---
If
 you'll come back again
---
", miss-- ma'am, and hand up a
 few more; it would save much time
---
The soft and continual shimmer of
 the dying lightning showed a marble face high against
 the black sky of the opposite quarter.
---
you thought
---
that it was on purpose to be married
---
And others thought so, too?"

---
" And you blamed me for it?"

---
you looked so
 gravely at me.
---
-- it would be dreadful.
---
that you should always think
 mistakenly of me
---
It was owing
 to circumstances which occurred after I got there.
---
that
 -- that we were
---
Now, do you see the matter
 in a new light?"

---
And perhaps it's no harm,
---
for you are certainly
 under no delusion that I ever loved you, or that I can
 have any object in speaking, more than that object
---
the horse was lame.
---
when it was too late
---
for it was perfectly true about
 
---
you to know that misunderstood bit of my history before

---
a time comes
---
when you could never know it
---
You want
 some more sheaves?"

---
the work proceeded.

---
you had
---
better go indoors now, you are
 tired
---
If the wind does
 not change the rain
---
But O, if your life should be lost!"

---
" You are not useless; but I would rather not tire
 you longer.
---
You have done well."

---
you are doing your very best for me
---
the latch of the gate fall
---
It was the vane on the
 roof turning round, and
---
this change in the wind was the
 signal for a disastrous rain.




 CHAPTER XXXVIII




---
IT was now five o'clock, and
---
the dawn was promising
.

---
The air changed its temperature and.
---
Cool breezes coursed in transparent
 eddies.
---
The wind shifted yet a point
 or two and.
---
In ten minutes every wind
 of heaven seemed.
---
Some of the
 thatching on the wheat- stacks was now whirled fantas-
 tically aloft, and.
---
that lay near at hand
---
This done
---
the twigs clashed
 in strife.
---
The rain came on in earnest, and
---
It was about seven o'clock in the dark leaden
 morning,"!"
---
It is done
---
Faint sounds came from the barn, and
---
Figures stepped singly and in pairs through
 the doors--.
---
all walking awkwardly, and
---
The others
 shambled after with a conscience- stricken air:  the whole
 procession was not unlike Flaxman's group of the suitors
.
---
The gnarled shapes passed into
 the village, Troy, their leader,.

---
" How are you this morning, sir?"
---
" Yes, it is a wet day.
---
" You look tired and ill, Oak.
---
You look"

---
What put
 that into your head?"

---
you did n't look
---
as you
 used to
---
, that was all
---
" Indeed, then you are mistaken."
---
" Nothing hurts me.
---
My constitution is an
 iron one.
---
our ricks covered
---
Yours of course are safe, sir.
---
What did you ask, Oak
---
" Your ricks are all covered before this time?"

---
" They are not."

---
" Then not a tenth of your corn will come."

---
It is difficult.
---
that the
 neglect to repair was abnormal and
 isolated
---
Yet at this very time, within the same
 parish, a greater waste had been going on, uncomplained
 of and disregarded.
---
who had suffered more,
---
you know as well as
---
that things have gone
 wrong with me lately
---
a little settled in life
---
in some way my
 plan has come to nothing."

---
my mistress would have married you
---
However, it is so sometimes, and
---
nothing
 happens.
---
that we expect
---
said Bold-
 wood,.

---
-- But the real truth of the matter is.
---
No
 engagement ever existed between me and Miss Ever-
 dene.
---
People say so, but
---
it is untrue
---
it is better
---
A silence followed.
---
":" it
 was made more of by other people.
---
than ever it was by
 us
---
what has passed between us two here
---
which pervade the highways of this undulating part of
 South Wessex
---
it is usual

---
for the farmers and other gig- gentry to alight at the
 bottom and
---
if it had n't been for that wretched rain
---
" Do n't you see all the chances?
---
, it altered

---
To speak like a book,
 wet weather is the narrative, and
---
fine days are the
 episodes, of our country's history
---
; now, is n't that
 true?"

---
I once read" But the time of year is come for changeable weather."

---
The fact is.
---
, these autumn races are the
 ruin of everybody
---
you could n't see the horses.
---
till they were
 almost in
---
The ground was as
 heavy as lead, and
---
all judgment from a fellow's experi-
 ence went for nothing.
---
Horses, riders, people, were

---
Three booths were
 blown over, and
---
the wretched folk inside crawled out
 upon their hands and knees; and
---
Aye,
 Pimpernel regularly stuck fast, when about sixty yards
 off, and
---
Policy stepping on
---
, it did knock
 my heart against the lining of my ribs
---
Never did I see such a day as' twas!
' when I saw, I assure you,
 my love!"
" And you mean,
---
that you have lost
 more than a hundred pounds in a month by this
 dreadful horse- racing
---
O, Frank, it is cruel
---
; it is
 foolish of you.
---
We shall
 have
---
to leave the farm; that will be the end of it!"

---
Now, there' tis again--
 turn on the waterworks
---
; that's just like you."

---
" But you'll promise me,
---
not to go to Budmouth
 second meeting wo n't you?
---
if it turns out to

---
" But the question of going to see the race or staying
 at home has very little to do with the matter.
---
Bets are

---
before the race begins
---
all booked safely enough, you
 may depend.
---
Whether it is a bad race for me or a
 good one
---
our going
 there next Monday
---
" But you do n't mean!"
---
that you have risked
 anything on this one too
---
" There now, do n't you be a little fool.
---
till you
 are told
---
Why, Bathsheba, you have lost all the pluck
 and sauciness you formerly had, and upon my life if I
 had known what a chicken- hearted creature you were
 under all your boldness
---
They moved on without further
 speech, some early- withered leaves from the trees which
 hooded the road at this spot occasionally spinning
 downward across their path to the earth.

---
The
 ridge was in a cutting,.
---
Though the overshadowing trees and the approach
 of eventide enveloped them in gloom
---
" Please, sir, do you know at?"

---
what time Casterbridge
 Union- house closes at night
---
where you are
---
" Walk the horse to the top
---
" But I--"
" Do you hear?
---
The horse, gig, and Bathsheba moved on.

---
" How on earth did you come here?
---
you were miles away, or dead
---
Why did n't you
 write to me?
---
" Have you any money?"

---
It is every
.
---
you know
---
Where are you going to- night?

---
You sha n't go there
---
Monday is
 the first free day I have; and
---
You
 sha n't want-
---
i'll see.
---
which completed the
 ascent of the hill
---
any
 observation whipped the horse into a trot
---
" Do you know?
---
you did
---
you do
---
if you will
---
The sentence was
 completed by a smart cut of the whip round Poppet's
 flank, which caused the animal to start forward at a
 wild pace
---
No more was said.





---
Her
 steps became feebler, and
---
it was.
---
broken crust of cloud stretched across the sky,; and
---
which
 hung over the town of Casterbridge
---
a distant halo was visible against
 the black concave,.
---
the luminosity appearing the
 brighter by its great contrast with the circumscribing
 darkness
---
A manor- house clock from the far depths of shadow
 struck the hour, one, in a small, attenuated tone.
---
After
 midnight the voice of a clock seems, and.

---
Afterwards a light-- two lights-- arose from the re-
 mote shade, and.
---
A carriage rolled along
 the road, and.
---
It probably contained
 some late diners- out.
---
The face was young in the
 groundwork, old in the finish
---
; the general contours
 were flexuous and childlike, but
---
the finer lineaments
 had begun.

---
The pedestrian stood up, apparently with revived
 determination, and.
---
The road appeared
, and
---
Presently there became
 visible a dim white shape
---
; it was another milestone.

---
This was beside a lone
 copsewood, wherein heaps of white chips strewn upon
 the leafy ground showed that woodmen had been
 faggoting and making hurdles during the day.
---
For a few seconds the wayfarer stood with that tense
 stillness which signifies itself to be not the end
---
as was shown by what followed
---
that it was--
---
The crutches answered well.
---
The crutches, though
 so very useful, had their limits of power.
---
Mechanism
 only transfers labour, being powerless to supersede it,
 and the original amount of exertion was not cleared
 away
---
; it was thrown into the body and arms.
---
The morning wind began.
---
which had
 lain still since yesterday
---
another milestone
 appeared, and
---
soon the beginning of an iron- railed fence
 came into view.
---
The Casterbridge lights were now individually visible,

---
It was getting towards morning, and
---
vehicles might be

---
There
 was not a sound of life, the hark of a fox, its three hollow
 notes being rendered at intervals of a minute with the
 precision of a funeral bell.

---
" The mile is to the
 county hall, and
---
my resting- place is on the other side
 Casterbridge.
---
then the other, then leaning
 over it
---
as it increases that of the strong
---
that the end lies five posts for-
 ward, and no further
---
This was a practical application of the principle that
 a half- feigned and fictitious faith is better than no faith
 at all.

---
" It lies only five further."

---
" But it is five further."

---
" That stone bridge is the end of my journey.
---
when the bridge over the Froom was in view
---
The truth is,."

---
Self- beguilement with to be false had given her strength to come over half
 a mile.
---
The artifice showed
---
; that limitation, and not comprehensiveness,
 is needed for striking a blow.

---
The road here ran across Durnover
 Moor, open to the road on either side.
---
Never was ingenuity exercised so sorely.
---
as the
 traveller here exercised hers
---
by which these last
 desperate eight hundred yards could be overpassed by a
 human being unperceived
---
But the exertion demanded by either of these latter two

---
was greater than to walk erect.
---
The faculty of con-
 trivance was worn out
---
, Hopelessness had come at
 last.

---
; it was softness and
---
it was warmth.
---
Whether
 Newfoundland, mastiff, bloodhound, or what not, it was
 impossible to say.
---
Darkness endows the small and ordinary ones among
 mankind with poetical power, and
---
The animal,,
 respectfully withdrew a step or two and,
---
the dog seemed: .
---
what was stranger than that the strong should need
 encouragement from the weak
---
was that cheerfulness
.

---
should be so well stimulated by such utter dejection
---
it was now.

---
It was evident.

---
Their progress was necessarily very slow.
---
They
 reached the bottom of the town, and
---
the Casterbridge
 lamps lay before them like fallen Pleiads, and.
---
as they turned
 to the left into the dense shade of a deserted avenue of
 chestnuts
---
Thus the town
 was passed, and
---
the goal was reached.

---
Originally it had been a mere
 case to hold people.
---
The shell had been so thin, so
 devoid of excrescence, and so closely drawn over the
 accommodation granted,.

---
what was
---
that the grim character of
 beneath showed through it,
---
as the shape of
 a body is visible under a winding- sheet
---
Then Nature, as if offended, lent a hand.
---
Masses
 of ivy grew up,,; and
---
till the
 place looked like an abbey
---
it was discovered.
---
that
 the view from the front, over the Casterbridge chimneys,
 was one of the most magnificent in the county
---
A
 neighbouring earl once said.

---
enjoyed
 by the inmates from theirs
---
This stone edifice consisted of a central mass and
 two wings
---
, whereon stood as sentinels a few slim
 chimneys,.

---
It was getting on towards six o'clock, and
---
sounds of
 movement were.
---
which
 was the haven of rest to this wearied soul
---
A little door
 by the large one was opened, and
---
These lifted the prostrate figure and.
---
" The Lord knows.
---
" said the other.

---
There is a dog outside
---
The little procession then moved forward-- the man
 in front bearing the light, the two bony women next,
.

---
Thus they entered the house and.




 CHAPTER XLI



 SUSPICION--
---
which was Sunday
---
This was the day before the Budmouth races.
---
" Bathsheba, could you let
---
me have twenty pounds
---
The fact is
---
there was such
 a volume of entreaty in the words.
---
Only such a few
 weeks ago you said
---
that you would give
 them all up for me; and
---
now, wo n't you give up this
 one, which is more a worry than a pleasure?
---
me fascinate you by all I can do
 -- by pretty words and pretty looks
---
that expresses more than the words it
 accompanies, and
---
which seems
---
as it
 was
---
The money is not wanted for racing debts at all
---
" What is it for?"
---
You worry me a great
 deal by these mysterious responsibilities, Frank."

---
Yet
 it was necessary."
---
You wrong me by such
 a suspicious manner
---
as you treat me
---
, the former being done,
---
we
 proceed to the latter
---
Bathsheba, fun is all very well,
 but."

---
" What do you regret?"

---
That my romance has come to an end."

---
" All romances end at marriage."

---
you would n't talk like that
---
You grieve me
 to my soul by being smart at my expense."

---
" You are dull enough at mine.
---
you hate
 me
---
"' Twould be much more.
---
if you set your-
 self
---
's strike a balance with
 the twenty pounds, and
---
If you must have it
---
before you are in
---
" And must you go?
---
Ah! there was a time, Frank,
 when it would have taken a good many promises to
 other people to drag you away from me.
---
You used to
.
---
But it does n't matter to you."

---
how
 my days are passed now
---
apparently actuated by
 NON LUCENDO principles
---
some words escaped
 her."
---
whether or not it was wise

---
whose is that
---
Whose should it
 be?
---
that-- it was yellow hair
---
" That's insulting me.
---
it was yellow
---
whose was it?
---
" You ought."

---
" Yes."
" It is wonderful!"

---
It is beautiful hair.
---
People used to
!"

---
Pooh! that's nothing
---
"-- that's nothing!"
---
people had
 turned
---
You
 knew."

---
what married life would be like, and
---
if you feared these contingencies
---
" This is all I get for loving you so well!
---
your life was dearer to me than my own
---
And now you sneer at my
 foolishness in marrying you.
---
O! is it kind to me to
?
---
Whatever opinion you
 may have of my wisdom
---
, you should not tell me of it so
 mercilessly,."

---
how things fall out
---
" Well you should n't keep people's hair.
---
You'll
 burn it,
---
wo n't you, Frank?"

---
you know nothing of If

---
you repent of marrying
---
You
 do n't repent
---
because you already love somebody better

---
than you love me
---
, do you?"

---
Why do you say that?"

---
" You wo n't burn that curl.
---
-- yes; it is pretty-- more
 beautiful than my miserable black mane!
---
Well, it is
 no use
---
if you will
---
" But just now you said" ties;" and then-- that
 woman we met?"
"'."

---
that reminded me of
 the hair
---
" Is it hers, then?"

---
There, now that you have wormed it out of
 me
---
you are content
---
There, now that you have wormed it out of
 me, I hope."
" And what are the ties?"

---
" Oh! that meant nothing-- a mere jest."

---
" Can you jest?

---
you know
---
; bare
 justice-- that's all!
---
Now, anything short of
 cruelty will content me.
---
to know never been encircled by a lover's arm.
---
the perception was rather that of self- sacrifice than of
 promotion and honour.
---
there was a certain degradation in renouncing the
 simplicity of a maiden existence to become the humbler
 half of an indifferent matrimonial whole--
---
as it was
---
The farmer stopped when still a long
 way off, and.
---
who was
 in a footpath across the field
---
Thus they continued for a long time.
---
Joseph Poor-
 grass now passed near them,.
---
then all three parted,
---
who had seen this pantomime with some
 surprise,
---
Well, what's the message, Joseph?
---
it was from general weakness of constitution
---
' tis said.
---
How very, very sad this is!
---
what suffering was
---
We
 ought
---
" There will hardly be time
---
When did you
 say?"

---
we must be at the door-- three o'clock
---
" Very well- you go with it.
---
A pretty waggon is
 better than an ugly hearse, after all.
---
" I wish I had known
 of it sooner. I thought." On'y been there a day or two."

---
That's the short of the story, ma'am.
---
You bain't well, ma'am, surely?
---
You look like a lily--
 so pale and fainty!"

---
That will do, Joseph
---
"; now you may go."

---
now that' tis put to me so judge-
 and- jury like
---
if ye'll believe me
---
The shrubs and flowers
 were all piled in the waggon,
---
" Whose sweetheart did you say, Joseph?"

---
" Are you quite sure?"

---
was only these
 few words.
---
that's
 clear enough
---
They then said
---
away
 they went.
---
Then I asked, and I had
" Have you heard a different story at all?'
---
" Hardly anybody in the parish knows the news yet."

---
These words were
, and
---
A's rather a curious item, but a
 very understanding shepherd, and learned in books."

---
that there did, ma'am
---
That will do.
---
you'll be late."

---
Who had
 been informed of the occurrence
---
Do you know?
---
" It was light, ma'am; but
---
so that you would
 hardly notice it
---
it looked beautiful then.

---
people mistook them-- --"
!"
---
Here a high
 gable stood prominent, and
---
it was covered like the front
 with a mat of ivy.
---
The
 single feature appertaining to it, beyond the expanse of
 dark green leaves
---
, was a small door.

---
The situation of the door was peculiar.
---
The sill
 was three or four feet above the ground, and
---
for a
 moment one was at a loss for an explanation of this
 exceptional altitude, till ruts immediately beneath sug-
.
---
that the door was used solely for the passage of
 articles and persons to and from the level of a vehicle
 standing on the outside
---
Upon the whole, the door
 seemed.
---
That entry and exit
 hereby was only at rare intervals.

---
that tufts of grass were allowed
---
As the clock over the South- street Alms- house pointed
 to five minutes to three
---
, a blue spring waggon, picked
 out with red, and containing boughs and flowers, passed
 the end of the street, and up towards this side of the
 building.
---
Whilst the chimes were yet stammering out
 a shattered form of" Malbrook."
---
The door then
 opened, and
---
a plain elm coffin was slowly thrust forth,
 and.

---
( We believe, and.)
---
that they do these things more
 tenderly now
---
as it had been
---
the rather pleasing funeral car crept down
 the hill, and along the road to Weatherbury
---
The afternoon drew on apace, and,
---
looking to the
 right towards the sea saw strange clouds and scrolls of mist rolling over
 the long ridges which girt the landscape in that quarter.

---
They came in yet greater volumes, and.
---
Then their
 dank spongy forms closed in upon the sky.
---
It was
 a sudden overgrowth of atmospheric fungi which had
 their roots in the neighbouring sea, and
---
by the time
 that horse, man, and corpse entered Yalbury Great
 Wood, these silent workings of an invisible hand, and.

---
they were completely enveloped,
 this being the first arrival of the autumn fogs, and the
 first fog of the series
---
The air was.
---
as an eye suddenly struck blind
---
The
 waggon and its load rolled no longer on the horizontal
 division between clearness and opacity, but
---
There was no perceptible motion in the
 air,.
---
not a visible drop of water fell upon a leaf of the
 beeches, birches, and firs
---
The trees stood in an attitude of intentness,.
---
as if
 they waited longingly for a wind to come and rock
 them
---
that the crunching of the waggon-
 wheels was as a great noise, and
---
which
 had never obtained a hearing except by night
---
small rustles,, were dis-

---
as it loomed faintly through the flowering laurustinus
---
Not a footstep
 or wheel was audible anywhere around, and
---
had by

---
The fog this time saturated the trees, and
---
this was the first
 dropping of water from the overbrimming leaves.
---
The
 hollow echo of its fall reminded the waggoner painfully
 of the grim Leveller.
---
Presently there was a continual
 tapping of these heavy drops upon the dead leaves, the
 road, and the travellers.
---
the rusty-
 red leaves of the beeches were hung with similar drops,
 like diamonds on auburn hair.

---
It was about
 a mile and a half from Weatherbury, and
---
in the meridian
 times of stage- coach travelling had been the place
 where many coaches changed and kept their relays
 of horses.
---
All the old stabling was now pulled down,
 and
---
little remained besides the habitable inn itself,
 which.

---
, standing a little way back from the road, sig-
 nified its existence to people far up and down the
 highway by a sign hanging from the horizontal bough
 of an elm on the opposite side of the way
---
for the variety TOURIST had hardly
 developed into a distinct species at this date--
---
Travellers -- some-
 times said in passing,.
---
when they cast their eyes up to
 the sign- bearing tree
---
, that artists were fond of repre-
, but
---
that they
 themselves had never before noticed so perfect an
 instance in actual working order
---
It was near this tree
; but,
---
owing
 to the darkness, the sign and the inn had been un-
 observed.

---
The manners of the inn were of the old- established
 type.
---
Indeed, in the minds of its frequenters they
 existed as unalterable formulae:  E.G.--
 Rap with the bottom of your pint for more liquor.

---
when the friendly
 signboard came in view, and
---
Going down into the kitchen of the inn, the floor
 of which was a step below the passage, which in its
 turn was a step below the road outside
---
These owners of the
 two most appreciative throats in the neighbourhood,
 within the pale of respectability, were now sitting face

---
to face over a threelegged circular table, having an
 iron rim to keep cups and pots from being accidentally
 elbowed off; they might have been said.

---
" Why,' tis neighbour Poorgrass!" said Mark Clark.

---
that was no more than a dew- bit
 afield."

---
" True, drink is a pleasant delight.".

---
the
 parish might lose confidence in me."

---
nobody to pay the bell
."

---
" The parish pays the grave half- crown, but
---
not the
 bell shilling, because the bell's a luxery: but
---
' a can
 hardly do without the grave, poor body.
---
our mistress will pay all
---
But what's yer hurry,
 Joseph?
---
you may as well sit down comfortable,
 and."

---
" Of course, you'll have another drop.
---
You feel so warm and
 glorious, and
---
you whop and at your work without
 any trouble, and
---
everything goes on like sticks
---
Too much liquor is bad, and; but
---
after all,
 many people have n't the gift of enjoying a wet, and

---
since we be highly favoured with a power that way
---
,
 we should make the most o't."True.
---
we ought not
.
---
But, what with the parsons and clerks
 and schoolpeople and serious tea- parties, the merry
 old ways of good life have gone to the dogs-- upon
 my carcase
---
, they have!"

---
what's your hurry?"

---
Providence wo n't be in a way with
 me for my doings
---
Your next world is your next world,
 and
---
ye to be a chapelmember, Joseph
---
, so be I." said Mark Clark.

---
Yes;
 there's this.
---
But to be a meetinger, you must
 go, and.
---
members be clever chaps enough in their way.
---
They
 can lift up beautiful prayers out of their own heads, all
 about their families and shipwrecks in the newspaper."

---
They can
---
" I wo n't say much for myself; I do n't wish to,"
.
" But I've never changed a single doctrine:  I've stuck
 like a plaster to the old faith I was born in."-- they can.
---
" said Mark Clark, with cor-
 roborative feeling;"
---
you see
---
it all printed aforehand, or, dang it all
---
, we should

---
no more know what to say to a great gaffer like the
 Lord than babes unborn,"
" Chapelfolk be more hand- in- glove with them above
 than we."
---
" We know very well.
---
if
 anybody do go to heaven
---
that, they will
---
They've worked

glided by uncounted
---
The minutes,
 until the evening shades began perceptibly and
---
the eyes of the three were but sparkling points
 on the surface of darkness.

At that moment hasty steps were heard in the entry,
 and

the door opened,

Joseph Poor-
 grass blinked, and.

as if it were not a member, but a dozy individual
 with a distinct personality

" Do n't take on so, shepherd!" said Mark Clark,

: why should we hurry to

what's not required

" We may."

To- mor-- row', to- mor--

 deeds in such confoundedly holy ways

that's the matter with me

All is the affliction called a
 multiplying eye, and

that's

how it is

-, you look double to me."

---
A multiplying eye is a very bad thing.

" said Mark
 Clark.

" It always comes on--
 house a little time."

as a person thrown

 against my hinder parts without groaning manfully

when I have been in a public" We ca n't say,"

that you have, Hero Poorgrass

Yet the shepherd says in the face of that
 rich testimony!

---
that neither of the three was in a fit
 state to Cake charge of the waggon for the remainder of
 the journey

It had gradually become rumoured in the village
.

that the body to be brought and

By the time,

---
The corpse is here, sir.

" Then that settles the matter.

We'll put off the
 funeral till to- morrow morning.

that they should
 go on to the church at once with their burden

to no purpose,
" It is unkind and unchristian.
---
Very well, then." said the parson.
---
that the funeral shall take place early
---
" And I will
 arrange to-
 morrow. We must remember."

---
it is

The parson's words spread into the heavy air with a
 sad yet unperturbed cadence, and

that could in any way have happened in
 connection with the burial

which nothing at all might

The scrawl was this simple one," Fanny
 Robin and child.

went out quietly by the front door

" DO you want me any longer ma'am?
---
who sat cheerless and alone in the large
 parlour beside the first fire of the season

 tried

You go to bed.

It is half- past ten now."

---
Why do n't you sit upstairs, ma'am?"

---
" It
 is n't worth."
---
while-- there's a fire here, Liddy
---
Have you heard?"

---
it makes

---
you cry so, ma'am

as the solitude of a mountain is to the solitude of a
 cave

In five or ten minutes there was another tap at the
 door.
---
it is n't
 true
---
And we shall be sure to know the rights of it in
 a day or two."

---
" No, Liddy- i do n't want you any more. I can
 hardly say why I have taken to crying lately: I never
 used. I know." What is it?"

---
you have heard
---
that a wicked story is got to Weatherbury
 within this last hour--
---
And
 there's only one name written on the coffin- cover."

---
And a good many others do n't;
 for we should surely have been told more about it--
---
if it
 had been true
---
do n't you think so, ma'am?
---
" I have heard nothing."
" I mean.
" I do n't believe it!"" We might or."

Patience and
 suspension of judgement for a few hours were, and

there was nobody.

but that could not

That was.
---
than these few words,!What is the truth of the story
---
It would
 be an inexpressible relief.
---
No further speech would
 need.
---
Every blade, every twig was still.
---
The air
 was yet thick with moisture, though somewhat less dense
 than during the afternoon, and
---
a steady smack of drops
 upon the fallen leaves under the boughs was almost
 musical in its soothing regularity.
---
lt seemed better to
, and
---
There was a light in one window only', and

The shutters were not closed, nor.

 robbery nor observation being a contingency which could
 do much injury to the occupant of the domicile

 which seemed to spread from that little dwelling

It was not.

it is not true!...

that there are two of you

A few moments passed, and
---
" It was best, and"

---
that they were asleep
---
which, when done, was not so
 dreadful.

---
when events were
---
by which a mean condition could be resolved into a
 grand one
---
And to that had
 destiny subjoined this rencounter to- night,, luck-

---
In Bath-
 sheba's heated fancy the innocent white countenance
 expressed a dim triumphant consciousness of the pain

---
that could not be

---
whilst the shames of life were measureless
---
Yet even this scheme of extinction by death was out
.
---
it is grievous and wicked
---
whether my spirit
 is willing or no
---
for a time the room was silent as a tomb
---
An instant after, the front door opened and
 closed
---
, steps crossed the hall, and
---
So little are instinctive
---
that somebody in the house had died
---
who's dead?"

---
me go out
---
then volition seemed, and
---
The candle was standing on a bureau close by them,
 and
---
the light slanted down,.
---
The
 clashes of feeling in all directions confounded one
 another,

there was motion in
 none.

" It is."

dismay modulated to illimitable
 sadness.

Capacity
 for intense feeling is proportionate to the general
 intensity of the nature, and

was, and,.

as one would kiss an infant asleep to avoid
 awakening it

what feeling was

All the strong
 feelings, seemed.
---
You will

It was such and unex-

---
But this was
 the mood of a few instants only.

Yet,
 perhaps. under the harrowing circumstances, to speak
 out was the one wrong act which can be better under-

If Satan had not tempted me with that face of

---
The first time was over-

---
hung by some large oak and beech trees.
---
what
 appeared like an impassable thicket
---
that was in reality
---
a
 brake of fern now withering fast
---
But it was with a freshened exist-
 ence and a cooler brain.

---
A coarse- throated chatter was the first sound.

---
It was a sparrow.

---
It was a finch.

---
It was a ploughboy.
---
They stopped
'.
---
them flouncing into the pool, drinking, tossing
 up their heads, drinking again, the water dribbling
 from their lips in silver threads
---
There was another
 flounce, and
---
they came out of the pond, and.

---
which had come
 down from the tree and
---
There was an opening towards the east, and
---
A morning mist hung
 over it now-- a fulsome yet magnificent silvery veil,
 full of light from the sun, yet semi- opaque-- the hedge
 behind it being in some measure hidden by its hazy
 luminousness.
---
the blades of which glistened
 in the emerging sun, like scythes
---
But the general
 aspect of the swamp was malignant.
---
The fungi grew in all manner of positions
 from rotting leaves and tree stumps
---
Some were marked with great splotches,
 red as arterial blood
---
, others were saffron yellow, and
 others tall and attenuated, with stems like macaroni.

---
Some were leathery and of richest browns.
---
The
 hollow seemed a nursery of pestilences small and
 great, in the immediate neighbourhood of comfort
 and health, and
---
" There were now other footsteps to be heard along
 the road.
---
the pedes-
 trian came into view.
---
Other words
 followed to the same effect.
---
; the book was a psalter, and

---
In the worst
 attacks of trouble there appears, and
---
which is left and open to the notice of trifles
---
anxiety began.

---
A form now appeared upon the rise on the other side
 of the swamp,, and.
---
half- hidden by the mist
---
" You ca n't come across."
---
It will
 bear me up
---
as they burst

---
" Poor thing!" said.

However
 did-- --"
" I ca n't speak above a whisper-- my voice is gone
 for the present." hurriedly.

Who sent you--

 something was wrong-- --"

---
" we wo n't go home at present, then.

they walked
 together further among the trees.

---
" But you had better come in, ma'am, and.
---
You will die of a chill!"

---
Now we'll walk
 about again.
---
They wandered about the wood for nearly two
 hours,.

---
" Then they think?"

---
to add:" You said
?"

---
that you might never go home
 again
---
-- you did n't mean it, ma'am

though this may include the trifling items of insult,
 beating, and starvation

 in a fearful situation; but

that has
 happened between you and him

when I first found you" No; I've altered my mind. I've thought of it all this
 morning, and I've chosen my course. I'm going I knew. May I ask?"
" You may ask; but

In about ten minutes they returned to the house by
 a circuitous route,.

 little stump bedstead in the small room

then it could

Samplers are out of date

" Now, Liddy, you've been looking into my book
 without telling me; and

you were not to

It would n't suit me a
 all."

if the others do-- --"

I said!" But" No, they do n't; and
---
which proved
---
The sun went down almost blood- red that night, and

---
a livid cloud received its rays in the east.
---
Up against
 this dark background the west front of the church
 tower-- the only part of the edifice visible from the
 farm- house windows-- rose distinct and lustrous, the
 vane upon the summit bristling with rays.
---
The
 spot had been consecrated to this ancient diversion from
 time immemorial.
---
, the old stocks conveniently forming
 a base facing the boundary of the churchyard, in front
 of which the ground was trodden hard and bare as a
 pavement by the players
---
the brown
 and black heads of the young lads darting about right
 and
---
They continued
, and

when the game
 concluded abruptly

the players leapt over the wall

 traced black lines

 Why should I read dismal books, indeed?" Why did the base- players finish their game so
 suddenly?"

" The lads went."

This done

There is always an inertia to be overcome in
 striking out a new line of conduct-- not more in our-
 selves than in circumscribing events, which
 appear as if leagued together to allow no novelties in
 the way of amelioration.

at five minutes before ten came back to
 the bridge at the lower end of the town, and.

Here now stood the tomb, snow-
 white and shapely in the gloom, consisting of head and
 foot- stone, and enclosing border of marble- work uniting
 them.

In the midst was mould, suitable for plants.

There were bundles of snow-
 drop, hyacinth and crocus bulbs, violets and double
 daisies, which were to bloom in early spring, and of
 carnations, pinks, picotees, lilies of the valley, forget- me-

The snowdrops
 were arranged in a line on the outside of the coping,
 the remainder within the enclosure of the grave.

The
 remainder were dispersed in the spaces between these.

:  ITS DOINGS


 THE tower of Weatherbury Church was a square
 erection of fourteenth- century date,.
---
Of
 these eight carved protuberances only two at this time
 continued that
 of spouting the water from the lead roof within.
---
One
 mouth in each front had been closed by bygone church-
 wardens as superfluous, and
---
two others were broken
 away and.

---
which
 still remained open and active
---
It has been sometimes argued;
 and.
---
that there is no truer
 criterion of the vitality of any given art- period than the
 power of the master- spirits of that time in grotesque
---
certainly in the instance of Gothic art there is
---
Weatherbury tower was a
 somewhat early instance of the use of an ornamental
 parapet in parish as distinct from cathedral churches,
 and the gurgoyles, which are the necessary correlatives
 of a parapet,.

---
that the hand could shape
---
that a human brain could conceive
---
There was,, that symmetry in their distortion
 which is less the characteristic of British than of
 Continental grotesques of the period.
---
All the eight
 were different from each other.
---
A beholder was.
---
It
 was too human to be called like a dragon, too impish
.
---
like a bird to be called a griffin
---
This horrible
 stone entity was fashioned
---
as if covered with a wrinkled
 hide; it had short, erect ears, eyes starting from their
 sockets, and its fingers and hands.
---
they thus seemed
---
it vomited
---
The
 lower row of teeth was quite washed away,.
---
though the
 upper still remained
---
against which its feet rested as a
 support
---
Here and thus, jutting a couple
 of feet from the wall, the creature had for four hundred years
 laughed at the surrounding landscape, voicelessly in
 dry weather, and in wet with a gurgling and snorting
 sound.

---
the rain increased
 outside.
---
In due time a
 small stream began.
---
which
 the water- drops smote like duckshot in their accelerated
 velocity
---
The stream thickened in substance, and in-
 creased in power, gradually spouting further and yet
 further from the side of the tower.
---
When the rain fell
 in a steady and ceaseless torrent the stream dashed
 downward in volumes.

---
We follow its course to the ground at this point of
 time.
---
The end of the liquid parabola has come forward
 from the wall,.

---
The force of the stream had,,
.

---
which had acted as a shield to the soil under the onset
---
These during the summer had been cleared from the
 ground, and
---
there was now nothing to resist the down-
 fall but the bare earth.
---
For several years the stream
 had not spouted so far from the tower, and
---
as it was doing
 on this night
---
such a contingency had been over-
.
---
Sometimes this obscure corner received no
 inhabitant for the space of two or three years, and

---
then it was usually but a pauper, a poacher, or other
 sinner of undignified sins.

---
The persistent torrent from the gurgoyle's jaws
 directed all its vengeance into the grave.
---
The rich
 tawny mould was stirred into motion, and.
---
The water accumulated and and
---
the roar of the pool thus formed.
---
created by the deluging rain
---
The flowers began to
 move and writhe in their bed.
---
The winter- violets
 turned slowly upside down, and.
---
Soon the snowdrop and other bulbs danced in
 the boiling mass like ingredients in a cauldron.
---
Plants
 of the tufted species were loosened,.

---
The rain had quite ceased, and
---
the sun was shining
 through the green, brown, and yellow leaves, now
 sparkling and varnished by the raindrops to the bright-
 ness of similar effects in the landscapes of Ruysdael and
 Hobbema, and full of all those infinite beauties that
 arise from the union of water and colour with high
 lights.
---
The air was rendered so transparent by the
 heavy fall of rain, and
---
that the autumn hues of the middle
 distance were as rich as those near at hand
---
intercepted by the angle of the tower
---
the
 remote fields ap-
 peared in the same plane as the tower itself.

---
The path, instead of being stony as
 it had been the night before
---
At one place in the path a tuft of stringy roots washed white and clean as a
 bundle of tendons.
---
they were the crocuses
---
the stream had made
---
The pool upon the grave had soaked away into the
 ground, and
---
it
 spotted the marble tombstone with the same stains.

---
Nearly all the flowers were washed clean out of the
 ground, and
---
they lay, roots upwards, on the spots whither

---
they had been splashed by the stream.

---
any
 observer would hardly have
.
---
as it did
---
The sight, coming
, superimposed upon the other dark scenery of
 the previous days, formed a sort of climax to the whole
 panorama, and
---
softened by time
---
now it was
.

---
lt is seldom.
---
that a person with much animal spirit does
 not feel
---
because the possession of that condition
 would have necessitated a different personality,
---
it seemed.
---
that matters would right themselves at some proper date
 and
---
This very morning the illusion
 completed its disappearance, and,
---
as it were
---
The suddenness was
 probably more apparent than real.
---
which
 just comes short of the ocean surface
---
A coral reef is no more to the
 horizon than if it had never been begun, and
---
the mere
 finishing stroke is.

---
what often appears
---
which has long been potentially an accomplished thing
---
who has

---
To turn about would
 have been hard enough under the greatest providential
 encouragement; but
---
to find, was more than nature
.

---
none of the
 villagers having yet risen
---
for whom a bed had

---
They looked curiously at the phenomenon for a time,
.

---
ing in the next room, the mistress of the house was
 still looking out of the window at the faint gleam
.
---
though this
 appearance failed
---
that a person was

---
till it began
---
the light vanished, re- enact
 in a worn mind the lurid scene of yesternight.

---
Almost before the first faint sign of dawn appeared

---
the panes being now
 wet with trembling tears left by the night rain
---
, each
 one rounded with a pale lustre caught from primrose-

---
From the trees came the sound of steady
.

---
What a heavy rain we've had in the night, ma'am!"

---
" Did you hear the strange noise from the church
 yard?"

---
it
 must have been the water from the tower spouts
---
" Well, that's, ma'am.

---
what the shepherd was saying
---
we are
---
But the tower
 spouts used to spatter on the stones, and puzzled,
 for this was like the boiling of a pot."

---
Not being able to read, think, or work
---
Are
 you going across to the church, ma'am?
---
you might like
---
The trees hide the place from your
 window."

 there were

now all the house knew.

that there had

---
it was futile

What makes?

when
 breakfast was over
---
It was nine o'clock,
 and

which was invisible from the road

Knowing the
 reprobates' quarter of the graveyard, called in the parish
" behind church.", it
 was impossible.

, its delicately veined surface splashed and

Emotional convulsions seemed

 mouth of the gurgoyle,

 sideways

a repetition of the accident prevented

nearly straight and perfectly white, the two sides
 approaching each other in a gradual taper till they
 met the sky at the top about two miles off.
---
out the length of this narrow and irksome inclined plane
 not a sign of life was visible on this garish afternoon

---
The air was warm and muggy, and

---
the top seemed.

---
marked only by faint lines, which had a
 semblance of being etched thereon to a degree not deep
 enough to disturb its general evenness,
---
Nothing moved in sky,
 land, or sea, except a frill of milkwhite foam along the
 nearer angles of the shore, shreds of which licked the
 contiguous stones like tongues.

enclosed by the cliffs

the water was uninteresting to a swimmer

which formed the pillars of Hercules to
 this miniature Mediterranean

who might be taken in it
---
Many bathers had

there prayed for a dry
 death from time to time, and, like Gonzalo also,; and
---
Not a boat
 of any kind was at present within sight, but
---
far in the
 distance Budmouth lay upon the sea,, and.
---
as it were quietly

---
, a moving object broke the
 outline of the extremity, and
---
immediately a ship's boat
 appeared.

They formed part of a brig's crew, and.

 riband of shade upon the horizon, a series of points of
 yellow light began.

where the lamps were
 being lighted along the parade

The cluck of their
 oars was the only sound of any distinctness upon the

Everybody's glance was now

The experience had

These appeared.

when all was ready

the farmer at once de-
 parted.

much as if nothing had happened
---
The first shades of evening were showing them-

Somebody
 came to the door,.

" Well, what is it, Liddy?"

there must be something got for you
 to wear
---
" What do you mean?

there must be something done for
 poor-- --"
" Not at present

It is not necessary."

" How do you know that?"

---
n't they have

---
how it is
---
death would have been different from how this is.
---
when two circumstances conjoined
---
The
 first was a short paragraph in the local newspaper,.
---
just as the sun was setting
---
Mr. Barker followed
 along the shore in the same direction.
---
, dusk had set in, and

---
nothing further was.

---
when it became necessary
---
that the notion was a perverse one
 to entertain
---
that others were
 assured in their opinion;
---
There was
 the little coil of pale hair which had been as the fuze to
 this great explosion.

---
"; they should be gone
 together.
---
No- i'll not burn it

---
THE later autumn and the winter drew on apace,
 and
---
the leaves lay thick upon the turf of the glades
 and the mosses of the woods.
---
that it might be

---
though not long gone by
---
which,, seemed infinitely

---
a gift life
 used
---
it brought
---
the change, beyond the substantial in-
 crease of wages, was little more than a
 nominal one addressed to the outside world
---
It sprouted,.

---
which had produced this ruin
 and waste
---
The strange neglect became the subject of whispered talk among
 all the people round; and
---
The sight of the pigs turning in disgust
 from the rotten ears seemed, and

---
,
 the farmer proposed at the interview
---
who was apparently determined by personal
 rather than commercial reasons
---
when the plan would present no difficulty, the two
 farms lying side by side
---
who was the go- between throughout
---
All was harmoniously arranged at last, and
---
we now
 see.

---
the actual mistress of the one- half
 and the master of the other, sitting in their respective
 homes in gloomy and sad seclusion
---
Whatever d'ye think.
---
" said Susan Tall," Gable Oak
.
---
' a hardly knows
 the name of smockfrock
---
It was eventually known.

---
it was
 money of a higher quality than mere wages, and
 capable of expansion in a way that wages were not
---
Some were beginning
---
simply because
 they were old
---
that a
 time was coming-- very far off perhaps, yet
---
It would be possible
.

---
" Fearful, did you say?
---
that you shall-- quite natural
---
You need n't take quite such long reaches with
 your rake, Lydia-- short and quick ones
---
whatever the lawyers may say to the
 contrary
---
" Have you been?"
---
Liddy, you
 need n't stay here a minute later than you wish, so
---
, what was worse,
---
after
 all, lighted upon one fact by way of repayment
---
It was
 a singularly fresh and fascinating fact, and
---
though not
 without its sadness it was pertinent and real.
---
Six years were a long time, but
---
how much shorter than
 never, the idea so long been obliged to
 endure!
---
that it was pos-
 sible and
---
this
 patience in delay would afford him an opportunity of
 giving sweet proof on the point
---
as if they were minutes
---
as
 it bore upon the consummation
---
Meanwhile the early and the late summer brought
 round the week in which Greenhill Fair was held.

---
This fair was frequently attended by the folk of Weather-
 bury.





---
the busiest, merriest, noisiest day of the
 whole statute number was the day of the sheep fair.

---
This yearly gathering was upon the summit of a hill
 which retained in good preservation the remains of an
 ancient earthwork, consisting of a huge rampart and
 entrenchment of an oval form encircling the top of
 the hill, though somewhat broken down here and there.

---
To each of the two chief openings on opposite sides a
 winding road ascended, and
---
enclosed by the bank
---
the level green space of
 ten or fifteen acres was the
 site of the fair.
---
A few permanent erections dotted the
 spot, but
---
the majority of visitors patronized canvas alone
 for resting and feeding under during the time of their
 sojourn here.

---
who attended with their flocks from long
 distances
---
Shepherds started from home two or three days, or even
 a week, before the fair,.
---
where they fed
---
Several of the sheep
 would get worn and lame, and
---
occasionally a lambing
 occurred on the road.
---
To meet these contingencies,
 there was frequently provided,.

---
into which
 the weakly ones were taken for the remainder of the
 journey
---
The Weatherbury Farms, however, were no such
 long distance from the hill, and
---
those arrangements
 were not necessary in their case.
---
When the autumn sun slanted over Greenhill this
 morning and
---
lighted the dewy flat upon its crest, nebu-
 lous clouds of dust were.
---
which streaked the wide prospect
 around in all directions
---
These gradually converged
 upon the base of the hill, and
---
the flocks became
 individually visible,.
---
which
 led to the top
---
Thus, in a slow procession, they entered
 the opening to which the roads tended, multitude after
 multitude, horned and hornless-- blue flocks and red
 flocks, buff flocks and brown flocks, even green and
 salmon- tinted flocks,.
---
dogs were barking, with greatest animation, but
---
a journey had grown
 nearly indifferent to such terrors,, a tall shepherd rising here and there in the midst
 of them, like a gigantic idol amid a crowd of prostrate
 devotees.

---
though they still
 bleated piteously at the unwontedness of their experi-
 ences
---
The great mass of sheep in the fair consisted of
 South Downs and the old Wessex horned breeds, to
 the latter class
---
These filed in about nine o'clock,
 their vermiculated horns lopping gracefully on each side
 of their cheeks in geometrically perfect spirals, a small
 pink and white ear nestling under each horn.
---
Before
 and behind came other varieties, perfect leopards as to
 the full rich substance of their coats, and only lacking the
 spots.
---
There were also a few of the Oxfordshire breed,
 whose wool was beginning to curl like a child's flaxen
 hair, though surpassed in this respect by the effeminate
 Leicesters, which were in turn less curly than the Cots-
 wolds.
---
But the most picturesque by far was a small
 flock of Exmoors, which chanced to be there this year.

---
Their pied faces and legs, dark and heavy horns, tresses
 of wool hanging round their swarthy foreheads, quite
 relieved the monotony of the flocks in that quarter.

---
thousands had

---
All these bleating, panting, and weary entered and were penned before the morning had
---
far
 advanced, the dog belonging to each flock being tied to
 the corner of the pen containing it.
---
Alleys for pedes-
 trians intersected the pens, which soon became crowded
 with buyers and sellers from far and near.

---
In another part of the hill an altogether different
 scene began.
---
A circular tent, of exceptional newness and size,
 was in course of erection here.
---
As the day drew on
---
,
 the flocks began; and
---
they turned their attention
 to this tent and.

---
whose
 soul seemed
---
, what was going on
---
as the tent was completed
---
As soon the band struck
 up highly stimulating harmonies, and the announce-
 ment
---
was publicly made, Black Bess standing in a con-
 spicuous position on the outside, as a living proof,.

---
If
 proof were wanted, of the truth of the oracular utterances
 from the stage over which the people were to enter
---
when
 the rush was at its fiercest
---
when the folk behind
 push me
---
which was jammed as in a vice
---
There was a silence
---
; then the drums and trumpets
 again sent forth their echoing notes.
---
The crowd was
.

---
as it stood
---
" Do n't ye lose yer temper, Jan!"
---
that
 they be a sinful form of womankind
---
they gradually reached
 the foot of the ladder,.
---
the sixpence, for admission,, having become
---
So they all entered, and
---
the cloth of the
 tent, to the eyes of an observer on the outside, became

---
such as we observe on
 a sack of potatoes
---
caused by the various human heads,
 backs, and elbows at high pressure within
---
At the rear of the large tent there were two small
 dressing- tents.
---
One of these, alloted to the male per-
 formers, was partitioned into halves by a cloth; and
---
in
 one of the divisions there was sitting on the grass,.

---
The brig Budmouth Roads was about to start on a voyage, though
 somewhat short of hands.
---
before they sailed a boat
---
A few months were
 sufficient to give him a distaste for this kind of life.

---
however pleasant a strange condition might
 be
---
whilst privations were easily warded off
---
, it was dis-
 advantageously coarse.
---
when money was short
---
was a frequent subject of curious
 conjecture.
---
the
 but the fact of drawing nearer to Weatherbury abstracted its
 fascinations, and
---
It was with gloom he.
---
Moreover, it was not at all unlikely; and
---
which we find at Greenhill Fair
---
the engage-
 ment might afford him a few weeks for consideration
---
It was thus carelessly, and without having formed any
 definite plan for the future,.

---
And now the mild autumn sun got lower, and in
 front of the pavilion the following incident had taken
 place.
---
This particular show was by far the largest and grandest
 in the fair, a horde of little shows grouping themselves
 under its shade like chickens around a hen.
---
the sheep have done well to- day
---
" we had."

---
" And now you are entirely at leisure?
---
Have you ever seen the play of" Turpin's Ride to
 York?"
---
, we must remember.
---
they
 can all be believed
---
But Turpin is true
 enough.
---
You have never seen
---
it played
---
What's that prancing?

---
How they shout!"

---
Black Bess just started off
---
in supposing you would like?
---
if it is one
---
if you would like to
---
whose assistance in such cases was always

---
hence it was."

---
if
 you will just look in first
---
if there's room
---
This feature consisted of one raised bench in very
 conspicuous part of the circle, covered with red cloth,
 and, and
---
who were

---
The interior was shadowy with a peculiar shade.

---
The strange luminous semi- opacities of fine autumn
 afternoons and eves intensified into Rembrandt effects
 the few yellow sunbeams which came through holes
 and divisions in the canvas, and.

---
until they alighted on inner surfaces
 of cloth opposite, and
---
If they see me
---
" Here's the devil to pay!
---
" How's that?"

---
" Why, there's a blackguard creditor in the tent
---
who'll discover me and
---
What's?
---
You must appear now
---
But the play must proceed.
---
" Do you give out,
 and, but
---
that Turpin has got a bad cold
---
me see
---
how we'll
 manage
---
what you can
---
"; go on with the piece and say nothing,
 doing by a judicious wink now and then,
 and a few indomitable nods in the heroic places, you
 know.
---
They'll never find out."

---
that the speeches are
 omitted
---
This seemed feasible enough, for Turpin's speeches
.

---
, the fascination of the piece
 lying entirely in the action; and accordingly the play
 began,
---
where Bess and Turpin are
---
that any
 horseman has passed
---
which could be heard all over the fair
 above the bleating
---
when the last sad scene came on,
 and
---
the body of the gallant and faithful Bess had,"."
---

 among the spectators,

 future years, Jan, and hand down to our children

 hold, immortality consists in being enshrined in others"

, then did Black Bess become immortal

---
when it was got through
---
the tent was lighted up.
---
; yet there was room for
 a doubt.
---
the neighbourhood would be awkward
---
It was now almost dark, and
---
respectable people
 were getting their carts and gigs ready to go home

---
The largest refreshment booth in the fair was provided
 by an innkeeper from a neighbouring town.
---
This was

---
The tent was divided into first and
 second- class compartments, and
---
fenced of from the body of the tent by a
 luncheon- bar, behind which the host himself stood
 bustling about in white apron and shirt- sleeves, and look-
 ing
---
candles being lighted
---
which, on, made quite a cozy and
 luxurious show, with an urn, plated tea and coffee pots,
 china teacups, and plum cakes

two little cuts crosswise in the cloth,

which rustled in the gloom like
 a pestilent wind

" Do n't you wish, Mrs. Troy

 unjust not to read it

 groups there gathered,

It was supposed.

However, the occurrence seemed.

for it had not interrupted a fiddler, who
 had lately begun playing by the door of the tent, nor

who were dancing" Major
 Malley's Reel" to the tune

 BATHSHEBA TALKS WITH HER OUTRIDER


 THE arrangement for getting back again to Weather-
 bury had been,
.
---
it being discovered late in the afternoon
---
that were not
 disposed of
---
It had grown
 twilight, but
---
that there was no cause for uneasiness,
---
as the
 moon would be up in half- an- hour
---
the moon having risen, and

---
the gig being ready
---
as it seemed, for the moon and the hill it
 flooded with light
---
Thus they descended into
 the lowlands, and the sounds of those left on the
 hill
---
came like voices from the sky, and
---
the lights were
 as those of a camp in heaven.
---
They soon passed the
 merry stragglers in the immediate vicinity of the hill,
.

---
They
 had gone two or three miles in the moonlight,, and other
 indifferent subjects,?"

" You forget;.

They were silent now awhile, and

" Do you remember?

you fainting in

---
: that was mine."

---
that events
 so fell out
---
you know
---
that you belonged
 ALMOST to me
---
But, of course, that's nothing.
---
You
 never liked me."

---
" How do you mean which?"

---
" Do you like me, or
---
do you respect me?
---
It is
 difficult.
---
My
 treatment of you was thoughtless, inexcusable, wicked!

---
If there had been anything
 I could have done to make amends I would most
 gladly have done it
---
-- there was nothing on earth
---
But that was not
 possible.
---
"
" Do n't blame yourself-- you were not so far in the
 wrong as you suppose.
---
you had
 real complete proof that you are what, in fact, you are
 -- a widow--
---
would you repair the old wrong to me by

---
" Well, then, do you know that without further proof
 of any kind you may marry again in about six years
 from the present-- subject to nobody's objection or
 blame?
---
where may we all
 be by that time

it will seem an
 astonishingly short time to look back upon."

---
You own

that you
 owe me--

that be your way of making them
---
" But, Mr. Boldwood-- six years--"
" Do you want?"

---
Perhaps it is not proper, and

---
us drop it
---
if you wish
---
But
 propriety has nothing to do with reasons.
---
On your side, at least, there
 is no passion or blamable haste-- on mine, perhaps
---
,
 there is.
---
if you choose
 from a feeling of pity, and, as you say, a wish to make
 amends
---
which will set all things right
 and

late though it may be

Have n't you been
 almost mine once already?
---
Surely you can say to
 me as much as this
---
, you will have me back again

---
it is only a little promise-- that
 if you marry again, you will marry me
---
It was
 a simple physical fear-- the weak of the strong; there
 no emotional aversion or inner repugnance.

we'll not mention,.

because those, of course, must be

" Promise!"

Christmas, we'll

which showed

how entirely the soul is the slave of the
 body, the ethereal spirit dependent for its quality upon
 the tangible flesh and blood
---
It is hardly too much to
.

When the
 weeks intervening between the night of this conversa-
 tion and Christmas day began perceptibly to diminish
---
They were auditing accounts, and something

which led Oak

the true
 reason why to do so for good or for evil, is this

-- it is a thing I have not breathed to a living soul as

" Really, do ye?

Heaven knows the very
 reverse of vain, for I am grieved and troubled to my
 soul about it

for
 it is terrible

since the case is so sad and oddlike
---
But,
 why do n't ye give the conditional promise?
---
" But is it right?
---
Some rash acts of my past life
 have taught me!
---
Such thoughts give a sort
 of absurdity to the scheme.

But is it wrong?

You know

is it wrong?"

 CHAPTER LII



 CONVERGING COURSES


                       
---
I
 CHRISTMAS- EVE came, and
---
a party that to give in the evening was the great subject of talk
 in Weatherbury.
---
It was not, but
---
that the rarity of Christmas
 parties in the parish made this one a wonder
---
The announcement
 had had an abnormal and incongruous sound,.
---
as if one
 should hear of croquet- playing in a cathedral aisle, or

---
that some much- respected judge was going upon the
 stage
---
That the party was intended.
---
there was no room for doubt
---
A large bough of
 mistletoe had been brought from the woods that day, and

---
Holly
 and ivy had followed in armfuls.
---
,
 roasting and basting operations were
---
As it grew
---
later the fire was made up in the large
 long hall into which the staircase descended, and
---
all
 encumbrances were cleared out for dancing.
---
which was
---
In spite of all this, the spirit of revelry was wanting

---
Such a thing had

---
never been attempted before by its owner, and
---
it was

---
now done as by a wrench.
---
Intended gaieties would
 insist upon appearing like solemn grandeurs,
---
the organ-
 ization of the whole effort was carried out coldly, by
 hirelings, and
---
a shadow seemed,.

---
that the proceedings were unnatural to
 the place and the lone man who lived therein, and hence
 not good
---
there's now.
---
If it had

---
not been for me, there would never have been one.
---
-- there's no more to be explained.

---
you are
---
this party is likely to bring
 me more.
---
how
 it sits upon me
---
" But you will leave off that, surely, ma'am?
---
You
 have been a widowlady fourteen months, and."

---
" Is it necessary?
---
The party does n't suit me a bit;
 but."
                     
---
that had just been

---
The
 tailor walked round and,

---
when the farmer had exclaimed against
 all such niceties as childish
---
that neither expense nor trouble shall be spared
---
though perhaps it may not
 be very early
---
it used
---
And sometimes,, a trouble is looming in the distance: .
---
Still this may be absurd
---
that it is absurd
---
Perhaps my day is dawning at last."

---
Yet perhaps my cheerful
 mess rests on a slender hope.
---
It is faith, not.
---
-- Oak, my hands are a little shaky, or some-
 thing
---
Perhaps
 you will tie it for me.
---
The fact is,."

---
you know
---
" Oh, it's nothing.
---
it done as well as you can
---
Is there any late knot in fashion, Oak?"

---
" That's a word as full o' holes as a
."

---
You have got quite
 cynical lately
---
-- how is it?
---
We seem
---
you honour my understanding too much
---
if it is made
 with an honest meaning to repair a wrong
---
" It has not gone far yet, but
---
it will
---
that's enough for me.
---
it may be a
 religious one, but
---
it's no such thing!"
---
Fifteen months nearly have passed,
 and
---
is there anything so wonderful in an engagement of
 little more than five years?"

---
" It seems long in a forward view.
---
, you have

---
once be'n deceived
---
A knock was given at the door,
 and
---
" That's a nuisance."

---
" But that's not it, exactly.
---
that is ayless a lammocken
 vagabond; and
---
that's a punishable situation.
---
, do you think?
---
Have you found out?"

---
all was.
---
, they say.
---
And they say
?
---
since they were
 at Greenhill Fair
---
what can folk believe
---
that you never
 saw a finer or more splendid creature in your life
---
when you passed by
 yesterday
---
them go past me to what was yond,
---
there were the fellers
---
you must
 own it: a higher class of animal- a finer tissue.
---
neither this haughty goddess,
 dashing piece of womanhood, Juno- wife of mine( Juno
 was a goddess,), nor
---
you know
---
anybody else shall hurt
 you.
---
But all this wants
---
that my work
 is well cut out for me
---
you look so well before
---
Yes- i'll tell
 you-- that night, a year and a
 half ago, when you came in so wildlike, and scolded us
 for making remarks about you and Mr. Troy."

---
when you looked like it
---
" At least they'll say so.
---
Ca n't my hair be brushed
 down a little flatter?
---
, you ca n't well be
 dressed plainer
,
---
than you are
---
unless you go in sackcloth at once
---
Tis
 your excitement is."

---
what makes
---
you look so noticeable
 to- night
---
what's the matter
---
what
 would you do, ma'am
---
Do
 you hear?"

---
But knowing what rum
 things we women be, I just said-- however, I wo n't
 speak of it again."

---
" No marrying for me yet for many a year; if ever,
" twill be for reasons very, very different from those you
 think, or
---
others will believe!
---
before you go
---
that little arrangement we made about your share in the
 farm
---
That share is small, too small, consider-

---
you give to it
---
since the world
 is brightening for me
---
then we'll discuss it at our leisure.

---
My intention is ultimately ment altogether, and
---
until you can take all the expendi-
 ture upon your shoulders
---
" We
 do n't know.
---
what may happen
---
There's many a slip,-- and
---
as they say
---
you'll pardon me this once--

---
what must have been a
 great pain to you
---
O that's not necessary
---
that this constant passion
 of the farmer made
---
to be succeeded by a deep solemnity
---
The noise of wheels at the front of the house became
 audible.
---
They be coming, sir--
---
" How does this cover me?"
---
" Nobody would recognize me now
---
" You've made up your mind?"
---
that you have got into, sergeant
---
You see
---
all these things
 will come to light, and
---
if you go back
---
they wo n't sound
 well at all.
---
as you be
 
---
Now that's my outspoke mind, and
---
here am I living from hand to
 mouth-- a needy adventurer.
---
Besides, it is no use

---
talking now; it is too late, and
---
if it had n't
 been
---
for you talking about the law, and rubbish about
 getting a separation
---
What the deuce put it into my head
---
Humbugging sentiment-- that's.
---
what it
 was
---
who you are talking to
---
" Well, sergeant, all I say is this,.
---
your play- acting is sure to come out,,.
---
you know
---
although
 you think otherwise
---
that if I were you I'd
 go abroad again where I came from--' tisn't too late to do
 it now I would n't stir up the business and My eyes and limbs, there'll be a
 racket!"

---
if you go back just now-- in the middle of Bold-
 wood's Christmasing
---
said the sergeant, with a slight
 laugh.
---
the guests will sit in silence and fear, and all laughter
 and pleasure will be hushed, and the lights in the
 chamber burn blue, and the worms-- Ugh, horrible!--
 Ring for some more brandy, Pennyways
---
Well, what is there besides?

---
it would be necessary
---
But there's
 no telling to a certainty from a body's outside.
---
Well,

as you tell me

what the time is

And l

"' Tis a strange story." said the next.

" You may
 depend upon't."

This was to some footsteps that were

---
a dim figure in the shades,
 coming up and
---
night, is n't it?
---
We met here a few minutes ago.
---
I all but missed the plank over the river
 ath'art." Oh, I hear now-- that's Sam Samway: 
---
I
 knowed the voice, too But I say, William."" have ye heard this strange tale?
---
said Smallbury,
---
Laban Tall named a hint of it to me
 but now-- but
---
A footstep drew near.

---
" Yes,' tis I." said Tall.

---
" Have ye heard any more about that?"

---
" No." said Tall,.
---
we'd better keep quiet
---
If so be' tis not
 true,.
---
if so be' tis true
---
God send that it
---
mid be a lie, for

---
that's true; and
' tis a thing that can be said of very few
---
: there's nothing
 underhand wi' her."

---
They stood silent then,.
---
Then the front door again
 opened
---
, the rays streamed out,
---
the
 door closed,
---
We'd better stand quiet
---
, they being under the bushes on the grass.

---
They heard.

---
this night will be
 nothing but misery to me!
---
" I hope to God O my darling, my darling,
 why do you keep me in suspense like this?"

---
they all distinctly heard
 it.
---
the noise
 from indoors was again just audible, until,.
---
a few minutes
 later, light wheels could be distinguished
---
They drew nearer, and.

---
the door closed
 again.

---
You do n't know much of master,.
---
if you thought
 that
---
" I thought.
"" said Samway.

---
we heard
---
we had told of the report at once
---
More harm may come of this than

---
" we know of.
---
Poor Mr. Boldwood, it will, be hard upon
 en.
---
Well, God forgive me
 for such a wish!
---
Nothing has prospered in Weatherbury.
---
Samway, Tall, and Smallbury agreed,
 and.
---
The three soon drew near the malt- house,
.
---
The pane of glass was illuminated
 as usual.
---
Smallbury was a little in advance of the rest
!
---
The light from the pane was now perceived, but upon some
 object close to the glass.
---
It was a human face.

---
's come closer
---
they
 approached on tiptoe.
---
There was.
---
", is n't it--
---
tis only
 keeping up o' Christmas
---
When they were quite
 out of earshot all by one instinct paused.

---
And so it did me."
---
said Samway.
---
What's
---
" to be
 done?"

---
Smallbury
 murmured dubiously.

---
" I do n't see."" But it is!'
---
which is everybody's business
---
-- you'd better go and."

---
" I bain't fit for any such thing." said Laban, nervously.

---
said Smallbury.

---
ye'll see
---
" I should think if anybody." I shall have nothing to do with it."" We do n't know.
---
Tall reluct-
 antly answered.
---
" Very well." said Samway.

---
Laban then went to the door.
---
the hum of bustle rolled out as a wave upon a still
 strand--.
---
the assemblage being immediately inside the
 hall- and
---
One of them
 began, and
---
that
 walking was thing not worth doing now
---
Laban must have seen mistress by
 this time
---
" I should think." said Smallbury,.
---
The door opened.
---
Tall appeared, and
---
joined them
" Well?" said both.

---
Laban faltered
 out.
---
" They were all in such a stir,.
---
Somehow the fun seems,
---
though everything's there,
 and
---
that a heart can desire
---
we had better all go in together
---
said
 Samway, gloomily."
---
what cold unkindness that would have been,

---
which, like the hall, was decorated with holly
 and ivy, and
---
Nobody was in the room, but
---
" I did n't like." Somehow the fun seems to hang
 fire, though everything's there that a heart can desire,
 and I could n't for my soul interfere and throw damp
 upon it-- if' twas to save my life, I could n't!"
" I suppose." Perhaps I may have a chance of
 saying a word to master."
" Mrs. Troy-- you are not going?
---
" We've
 hardly begun!"

---
If you'll excuse me
---
as it is
 not late
---
when they choose
---
You know perhaps what I
 long to say?"

---
" You do give it?"
---
" Now, that's evasion!
---
it become

---
, you know,
---
who are beyond the influence of passion
---
how false this picture was
---
You owe it to me!"

---
Honesty and pure conviction suggested.

---
unaccompanied by any perception that it might have

---
However, it had not much effect now,.

---
what is right to do in my
 diddicult position
---
nobody to advise me
---
" You'll marry me between five and six years hence?"

---
" But surely you will name the time, or
---
there's nothing
 in the promise at all?"

---
me go
---
that seems, and
---
perhaps it is breaking the commandments.

---
then it
 is dreadful
---
me ask a solicitor
---
" Say the words, dear one, and a blissful loving intimacy of six years, and
 then marriage-- O Bathsheba
---
the subject shall be
 dismissed;
---
And showed uncalled- for heat of manner towards you, believe
 me, dear
---
You would n't let,
!
---
a dog suffer
---
could you but know it
---
as they quivered against
 the light
---
And you'll not-- press me-- about
 anything more--?
---
if we both live
---
" And you'll take this as a token from me."

---
" What is it?
---
a soul know!
---
that it's an engagement
---
Perhaps it
 is improper?
---
Besides, we are not engaged in the usual
 sense
---
, are we?
---
" It means simply a pledge-- no sentiment-- the seal
 of a practical compact."
---
You frighten me, almost.
---
me go home
---
if you wish it so
 earnestly
---
" And it shall be the beginning of a pleasant secret
 courtship of six years, with a wedding at the end?"

---
It must be
---
since you will have it so
---
" God bless
 you!"

---
To get to the door it was necessary, and
---
There was no music or dancing in progress just now.

---
which had been arranged for the work-
 folk specially
---
What is it, men?
---
you are in doubt about
---
One of them turned and."

---
" It was
 something Laban heard of
---
, that's all, sir
---
Anybody married or?
---
One would think from your looks and mysterious ways
."

---
that it was something very dreadful indeed
---
" O no, sir, nobody is dead."
---
said Tall.

---
somebody was
---
" I wish." said Samway, in a whisper.

---
" What do you say, Samway?"
---
If you have anything to say
---
said Samway to
 Tall.
---
If you want
---
" Do you know?"
---
what they mean
---
There was a smart rapping at the door.
---
" It is a stranger, ma'am."
---
The message was given, and
---
There was an unearthly silence,.
---
all looking towards
 the newcomer
---
who had just learnt
---
" Come, madam, do you hear?
---
A strange voice came from the fireplace--.

---
a voice
 sounding far off and
---
Hardly a soul in the assembly recognized the thin tones
.
---
The truth was
.
---
no obscuration was apparent
 from without
---
The scream had been heard but a few seconds
---
When
 it was followed by sudden deafening report that
 echoed through the room and stupefied them all.
---
The
 oak partition shook with the concussion, and
---
the place
 was filled with grey smoke.

---
The veins had, and
---
-- there was a contraction-- an exten-
 sion--, and
---
It was double- barrelled,
 and
---
the gun exploded a second time,.

---
which
 crossed the ceiling
---
" Well, it makes no difference!"
---
" There is another way for me to die."

---
, mounted Mellstock Hill, and
---
between
 eleven and twelve o'clock crossed the Moor into the town.

---
The streets were nearly deserted now, and
---
which was closed
 by an iron studded pair of doors
---
This was the entrance
 to the gaol, and
---
over it a lamp was fixed, the light en-

---
The small wicket at last opened, and a porter

---
the door was
---
, the scene was terrible.
---
All the female guests were
 huddled aghast against the walls like sheep in a storm,
 and

though scarcely a single drop of blood had

The temporary coma had ceased, and
---
activity
 had come with the necessity for it.
---
which seem ordinary in philosophy
---
Deeds of endur-
 ance,, are rare in
 conduct, and
---
only the wellknown lines
 remained
---
it was hers, all else in the picture

---
It is, useless, but.
---
-- had there been a quarrel?

---
, this
 fatal event had been superimposed.
---
However, it was too
 late now, and

---
The miles necessary to be traversed, and other
 hindrances incidental to the lateness of the hour and
 the darkness of the night, delayed the arrival of Mr,
 Aldritch, the surgeon; and
---
ally detained in Casterbridge through having to give
 notice to the authorities of what had happened; and

---
" Who has?
---
" said the doctor.

---
A was quite dead, sir."

---
This was astonishing information.

"" said the doctor.
---
" There will have

for folks to stare at for all the
 crowners in England

What has been
 done?
---
" My mistress has done it all."

a nurse come in

that was for more candles,
---
because hers had burnt
 down into the socket
---
we were
---
when you or Mr. Thirdly came, sir
---
they all went upstairs together,.
---
preceded by Liddy
 Smallbury
---
Everything was silent as the grave.
---
when
 they paused on the landing
---
the key turned in the lock, and
---
" Oh, Mr. Aldritch, you have come at last.
---
Well, all is done, and

---
Looking into the chamber of death they saw by the light of the candles which were on the
 drawers a tall straight shape lying at the further end
 of the bedroom, wrapped in white.
---
Everything around
 was quite orderly.
---
The doctor went in, and
---
after a
 few minutes returned to the landing again,.

---
" It is all done, indeed,." remarked Mr.
 Aldritch, in a subdued voice."
---
The body has been
 undressed and properly laid out in grave clothes.

---
they saw

---
as if at that
 instant to prove
---
The simple consciousness that superhuman strain was

---
The sufferer was got to bed, and
---
" O it is my fault
 --
---
WE pass rapidly on into the month of March, to a
 breezy day without sunshine, frost, or dew.
---
where the turnpike road passes over
 the crest, a numerous concourse of people
---
the greater number being fre-

---
On Yai*-
 bury Hill, about midway between Weatherbury and
 Casterbridge, had
 gathered, the eyes of quently stretched afar in a northerly direction.
---
one of which contained the high
 sheriff
---
many of whom had mounted
 to the top of a cutting formed for the road
---
At the end of half- an- hour a faint dust was seen in
 the expected quarter, and shortly after a travelling-
 carriage, bringing one of the two judges on the Western
 Circuit
---
The
 judge changed carriages, and a procession being
 formed of the vehicles and javelin- men
---
whilst a flourish was blown
 by the big- cheeked trumpeters
---
, they all pro-
 ceeded towards the town,.

---
as they had seen the judge move
 off
---
who as soon returned home again to their work
---
you squeezing close to the carriage
---
as they walked
---
Did ye notice my lord
 judge's face?"

---
that was towards
 me
---
a bystander said"
---
who can talk like that
---
The resolution was adhered to; and
---
all waited
 anxiously for the news next day.
---
Their suspense
 was diverted, however, by a discovery which was made
 in the afternoon,.

---
which had

---
nobody imagined.

---
There were two muffs,
 sable and ermine.
---
Above all there was a case of
 jewellery,.
---
These things had been bought in Bath and
 other towns from time to time, and.
---
brought home by
 stealth
---
They were all carefully packed in paper, and

---
But I do n't like,;."
 as I said,
" a
 date being subjoined six years in advance in every
 instance.

---
as every
 one supposed
---
The conviction now became general.
---
Facts
 elicited previous to the trial had pointed strongly in the
 same direction, but
---
they had not been of sufficient weight
.
---
now that a
 presumption of insanity was raised
---
It was astonishing,, how many collateral
 circumstances were remembered.

---
to which a condition
 of mental disease seemed
---
A petition was addressed to the Home Secretary,
.
---
which appeared
---
It was

---
not" numerously signed" by the inhabitants of Caster-
 bridge,,.
---
that God made country villages to supply customers
 to county towns,
---
the result was that evidence
.

---
it was hoped
---
which might remove the crime
 in a moral point of view, out of the category of wilful
 murder, and
---
The upshot of the petition was waited for in Weather-
 bury with solicitous interest.
---
The execution had been
 fixed for eight o'clock on a Saturday morning about a
 fortnight
---
after the sentence was passed, and
---
up to
 Friday afternoon no answer had been received.
---
some moving
 figures were there.
---
They were carpenters lifting a post
 into a vertical position within the parapet.
---
It was dark, and
---
half the
 village was out.

---
ever, that we can talk of another time.
---
Has there been
 any change in mistress this afternoon?
---
if you be come
---
if there's news,
---
you've come
---
" There's a chance yet; but
---
Laban is here
---
" Yes." said Tall.

---
is,
---
that you shall ride to town
 the last thing to- night
---
If nothing
 has been received by eleven to- night
---
, they say."

---
there's
 no chance at all
---
If it is not
---
If you have n't seen poor mistress since Christmas
---
Laban departed, and
---
when they all were weary

---
At last, the tramp of a horse was heard in the distance--
 First dead, as if on turf it trode,

---
We shall soon know now, one way or other.
---
they all stepped down from the bank on
, and
---
which they had been standing into the road
---
the
 rider pranced into the midst of them.

---
" Is that you, Laban?
---
" Yes--' tis come.
---
The utter
 prostration when all un-
 certainty upon every subject had come to an end.

---
As the summer drew on
---
till it appeared preternatural
---
Underneath this was now inscribed in new letters:--
 IN THE SAME GRAVE LIE
 THE REMAINS OF THE AFORESAID

---
WHO DIED DECEMBER24TH,18
---
The door was, and
---
the choir was learning a new
 hymn.
---
the imminent tears to flow
---
if they wished
---
which had been without emotion
 during enactment
---
those scenes had emotion then.
---
how long have you
 been here
---
" Are you going in?
---
there came
 from within the church as from a prompter--

---
l loved the garish day, and, spite of fears
---
,
 pride ruled my will
---
",
 you know.
---
me drive you away
---
" O no-- you do n't drive me away.

---
you going into church
---
if they had cut the inscription
---
, you need n't mind,."

---
if
 you wish to
---
, on the matter which is in both our minds
 at this moment
---
" And have they done it?
---
as you wished
---
if you have not already
---
So together they went and.
---
" It seems like yesterday to me."

---
as if it were years ago- long years
---
if you'll allow me
---
It is
---
The fact is,
---
you know
---
" Why, Gabriel, what are you
 going?"

---
" California is the spot I've had in my mind to try."

---
" But it is understood everywhere."

---
that you are going

---
o' it' tis true; but nothing is
 and
---
you ought
---
You've been with
 me so long-- through bright times and dark times-- such
 old friends that as we are-- that it seems unkind almost.
---
if you leased the other farm as master
---
that,
 you might still give
---
" Yes, that's the ill fortune
---
" And it is because of that very help-

---
like the others become weary and neglectful
 of the old cause
---
Three weeks went on, and
---
where the farm accounts were kept,
---
The autumn wore away gloomily enough amid these
 melancholy conjectures, and com-

---
Christmas- day came,
---
there was the barest excuse for a divergence.

---
The next morning brought the culminating stroke
---
A lively firelight shone from the window, but
---
nobody
 was visible in the room.
---
if it were right
---
" Who have I
 the honour--
---
" It is so seldom.
---
Will you sit
 down, please?
---
Here's a chair, and
---
there's one, too.

---
" They are quite easy enough for me."

---
It was very
 odd to these two persons, who knew each other passing
 well,.
---
that the mere circumstance of their meeting in a
 new place and in a new way should make them so
 awkward and constrained
---
when they were strangers
---
" You'll think it strange that I have come, but--"
" O no; not at all."

---
that you are going
 away on that account.
---
It grieved me very much and

---
As if you could do that
---
what are you

---
you know
---
You know
---
Still, that would n't
 prevent as before,."

---
had n't
 it been
---
that things have been said about us
---
Things said
 about you and me!
---
What are they?"

---
" I can not tell you."
" It would be wiser
---
if you were to
---
You have

---
why you should fear
---
" It would be wiser if you were to, I think. I do n't
 see."
" It is nothing that you have done, this time.
---
The
 top and tail o't is this--.
---
What does that mean?"

---
that I am sniffing about here,
 and You asked me to
."

---
so you must n't blame me
---
that you meant
---
as that is too absurd
---
" Yes; of course, it is too absurd.
---
that was plain enough by
 this time
---
Surely, surely you be the last person in the
 world I think of marrying.
---
It is too absurd,."

---
as you say

---
" Too-- s- s- soon" were the words I used
---
you
 said," too absurd," and
---
But it
 does n't matter a bit-- not at ali-
---
what I said but I only meant,
" too soon", I did n't, Mr. Oak, and you must
 believe me!"

---
" But you never will know."
---
Because you never ask
---
--"
" You ought."
---
" It shows!
---
you did n't
 care a bit about me, and
---
It was very cruel of you, consider-

---
you were the first I ever had; and
---
You know
---
" it was purely; and
---
that it might injure your good name
---
Nobody knows the heat and fret I have been caused
 by it."

---
" And was that all?"
" All."

---
as they went to the door
---
"," it seems exactly as if
 I had come courting you-- how dreadful!"

---
it is hard to be-
 grudge me this one visit."

---
They spoke very little of their mutual  feeling; pretty
 phrases and warm expressions being probably un-
 necessary between such tried friends.
---
Theirs was that
 substantial affection which arises( if any arises at all)
,
 and not the best till further on, the romance growing
 up in the interstices of a mass of hard prosaic reality.

---
who are thrown together
---
when the two begin first by

---
This good- fellowship-- CAMARADERIE--  usually occurring
 through similarity of pursuits, is unfortunately seldom
,.
---
Where, however, happy circumstance
 permits its development
---
, the compounded feeling proves
 itself.




 CHAPTER LVII




---
which is strong as death
---
which many waters can not quench
---
usually called by the
 name
---
beside which the passion is evanescent as steam
---
that it is
 possible to have
---
" A licence-- O yes, it must be a licence."
---
They walked together into the village.

---
until
 they came to a little lane behind the church,
---
who had lately been
 installed as clerk of the parish, and
---
what's going on
---
It seemed rather ungenerous, and
---
" You've proved me, and
---
you know."

---
that this
 great hush is not, or
---
what
 either of us would have wished
---
if it had n't been for
 certain things that would make a gay wedding seem
 hardly the thing
---
And you be now going down to the clerk."

---
" Yes; you may as well come with me."

---
as they walked along
---
you standing in the background
---
you can tell yer tale.
---
This scheme was considered feasible; and
---
Tall herself opened it.

---
you will
---
"?" said Mrs. Tall.

---
" The clothes will floor us as safe as houses!"
---
" It ca n't be helped."
---
The fact is,'
---
There, that's what' tis,
 and
---
Mother Tall ha' done
---
next they called at the vicar's in a manner which
 excited no curiosity at all.
---
you to call me at seven o'clock to- morrow
---
" But you always do wake afore then, ma'am."

---
it's best to
."

---
About
 six, being quite positive
---
it was I who had to call you
---
" And it is n't six yet."

---
Indeed it is
---
; how can you tell such a story, Liddy?

---
it must be ever so much past seven
---
as you can
---
you to give my
 hair a good brushing
---
Whatever IS going on,
 ma'am
---
" But is it safe, ma'am, after what's been said?
---
It makes.
---
my heart go quite
 bumpity- bump"

---
" It makes mine rather furious, too
---
" However, there's!"

---
It was a damp disagreeable morning.
---
Ten minutes later
 a large and a smaller umbrella might have been seen
.
---
The distance was not more
 than a quarter of a mile, and
---
these two sensible persons
 deemed it unnecessary to drive.
---
An observer must have
.
---
which, considering, was perhaps not very wonderful
---
In
 the church were Tall, Liddy, and the parson, and in a
 remarkably short space of time the deed was done.

---
for it had been
 arranged
---
,
 their ears were greeted by the firing of a cannon,
.

---
followed by what seemed like a tremendous blowing of
 trumpets, in the front of the house
---
those fellows
 were up to something
---
at
 the same moment bang again went the cannon in the
 background,.
---
followed by a hideous clang of music from
 a drum, tambourine, clarionet, serpent, hautboy, tenor-
 viol, and double- bass-- the only remaining relics of the
 true and original Weatherbury band-- venerable worm-

---
which had celebrated in their own
 persons the victories of Marlhorough, under the fingers
 of the forefathers of those who played them now
---
The
 performers came forward, and.

---
" Come in, souls, and
 have something to eat and drink wi' me and my wife."

---
" Not to- night." said Mr. Clark, with evident self-
 denial.
---
we'll call at a
 more seemly time.
---
However, we could n't think of
 letting the day pass without a note of admiration of
 some sort.
---
If ye could send a drop of som'at down to
 Warren's
---
, why so it is.
---
" A bit and
 a drop shall be sent to Warren's for ye at once.
---
" I never heerd a skilful old married feller of twenty
 years" standing pipe" my wife" in a more used note
 than' a did." said Jacob Smallbury.
---
It might have been
 a little more true
---
that was n't.

---
" That improvement will come wi' time."
---
their friends turned to
.

---
that's the size o't
---
Ephraim
 is joined to idols
---
But since' tis as' tis
 why, it might have been worse, and
---
