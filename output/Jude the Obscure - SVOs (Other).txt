" Yea, many there be. 
---
they do thus
---
The schoolmaster was leaving the village, and
---
everybody seemed sorry.

---
For the schoolhouse had been partly
 furnished by the managers, and
---
the only cumbersome article possessed
 by the master, in addition to the packing- case of books,. 
---
But the enthusiasm
 having waned
---
The rector had gone away for the day,. 
---
who disliked the
 sight of changes
---
the new school- teacher would have arrived and
---
everything would be smooth again.


---
The blacksmith, the farm bailiff, and the schoolmaster himself were

---
The master had remarked that
---
who had been thoughtfully assisting in the
 packing
---
as they rubbed their chins
---
it could be put there, perhaps,
---
till you've
 found a place to settle in, sir
---
" A proper good notion," said the blacksmith.


---
It was decided. 
---
The smith and the bailiff started
 and
---
if the truth must
 be told
---
The regular scholars,, stood at the present moment afar off, like certain historic
 disciples,.


---
" Why do you go, sir?"
---
" Ah-- that would be a long story. 
---
You would n't understand my reasons,
 Jude. 
---
You will, perhaps, when you are older."


---
" Well-- don't speak of this everywhere. 
---
You know, and a university degree? 
---
what a university
 is
---
My scheme, or dream, is, and
---
if my scheme is practicable at all
---
that being on the
 spot will afford me a better chance of carrying it out than I should
 have elsewhere
---
It was accordingly left in
 the school till the evening, when more hands would be available for
 removing it; and
---
the schoolmaster gave a final glance round.


---
as the cart moved off
---
you can
---
if ever you come to Christminster
---
The cart creaked across the green, and.
---
disappeared round the corner
 by the rectory- house
---
The well was as ancient as the village itself, and
---
There was a lining of green moss near the top, and nearer still the
 hart's- tongue fern.


---
that the schoolmaster had drawn at that well scores of times on a
 morning like this, and
---
The morning
 was a little foggy, and
---
interrupted by a sudden outcry
---
you idle young harlican
---
the well
 stood-- nearly in the centre of the little village, or rather hamlet
 of Marygreen.


---
It was as old- fashioned as it was small, and
---
it rested in the lap of
 an undulating upland adjoining the North Wessex downs. 
---
the well- shaft was probably the only relic of the local
 history that remained absolutely unchanged. 
---
Many of the thatched
 and dormered dwelling- houses had been pulled down of late years, and

---
many trees felled on the green. 
---
Above all, the original church,
 hump- backed, wood- turreted, and quaintly hipped, had been taken
 down, and. 
---
In place of it
 a tall new building of modern Gothic design, unfamiliar to English
 eyes, had been erected on a new piece of ground by a certain
 obliterator of historic records who had run down from London and back
 in a day. 
---
The site whereon so long had stood the ancient temple to

---
the Christian divinities was not even recorded on the green and level
 grass- plot that had immemorially been the churchyard,.




---
the obliterated
 graves being commemorated by eighteen- penny cast- iron crosses
 warranted to last five years
---
on which was painted
 in yellow letters
---
this being one of the few old houses left--
---
you was last this way." 
---
who answered
---
who spoke tragically on the most trivial subject, and

---
as you
 know
---
" It would ha' been a blessing
! 
---
if Goddy- mighty had took thee too, wi' thy mother and father, poor
 useless boy
---
what's,. 
---
The local washerwoman replied."


---
" Why did n't ye get the schoolmaster to

---
It runs in our
 family rather. 
---
as it happened
---
after they were married
---
then they only had one till--
---
The brown surface of the field went right up towards the sky all
 round, where it was lost by degrees in the mist that shut out the
 actual verge and accentuated the solitude. 
---
The only marks on the
 uniformity of the scene were a rick of last year's produce standing
 in the midst of the arable
---
" How ugly it is here!"
---
The fresh harrow- lines seemed. 
---
Every inch of ground had been the site, first or last,
 of energy, gaiety, horse- play, bickerings, weariness. 
---
Groups of
 gleaners had squatted in the sun on every square yard.
---
that had populated the adjoining hamlet
---
Love- matches
 had been made up there
 between reaping and carrying. 
---
who would not turn their heads
---
For them it was a lonely place,
.


---
They seemed, like
 himself,. 
---
which did not want them
---
they alighted
 anew.


---
You SHALL have some dinner--

---
" you shall. 
---
There is enough for us all. 
---
Farmer Troutham can afford
. 
---
you have some
---
They stayed and. 
---
as those lives were
---
The birds and Jude started up simultaneously, and
---
is it,
---
if you say,
' again in a hurry
---
And you've been idling at the
 schoolmaster's too, instead of coming here, ha'n't ye, hey? 
---
That's
!"


---
how you earn your sixpence a day for keeping the rooks off my corn
---
till the field echoed with
 the blows, which were delivered once or twice at each revolution
---
that-- there was a good
 crop in the ground
---
'em sow it
---
the rooks could have a
 little bit for dinner-- and and
---
you would n't miss it, sir--
---
This truthful explanation seemed, and
---
though that was keen enough
---
what was
 good for God's birds
---
by which was bad for God's gardener
---
as
 they always did in such weather at that time of the year
---
It was
 impossible to advance in regular steps without crushing some of them
 at each tread.


---
trees cut down or
---
that it hurt them
---
when the sap was up
 and
---
the tree bled profusely
---
as it may be called
---
This weakness of character,, suggested
. 
---
when the customer was gone
---
Well, how do
 you come
---
" What?"

" Mr. Troutham have turned me away. 
---
the rooks have a few
 peckings of corn
---
And there's my wages--
---
If you ca n't skeer birds
---
", what can ye do? 
---
There!
 do n't ye look so deedy! 
---
Farmer Troutham is not so much better than
 myself,. 
---
But' tis as Job said,' Now they that are
 younger than I have me in derision, whose fathers I would have
 disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock.' 
---
" Not that you should have let. 
---
the birds eat
---
what Farmer Troutham
 planted
---
Of course you was wrong in that. 
---
But, oh no-- poor or'nary child-- there never was any sprawl on thy
 side of the family, and
---
you ought. 
---
where the city of Christminster is
---
It is a place much too good for you ever

---
You did n't grow up hereabout, or
---
you would n't ask such as
 that. 
---
" How can I tell?"

" Could I go?"

 We've never had anything to do with folk in Christminster, nor
 folk in Christminster with we."


---
had by this time
---
The fog become more translucent, and

---
the position of the sun could be seen through it. 
---
That mercy towards one set of creatures was cruelty towards another
. 
---
As you got older, and
---
as you had felt
---
when you were little
---
not at a point in its
 circumference,, you were seized
 with a sort of shuddering
---
when there was nothing more to be done
---
Christminster lay
---
There was something
 unpleasant about the coincidence for the moment, but
---
The
 farmer had said; yet

---
Christminster lay across it, and
---
the path was a public one. 
---
till the track joined the highway by a little clump of
 trees
---
Here the ploughed land ended, and
---
III


 Not a soul was visible on the hedgeless highway, or on either side of
 it, and
---
the white road seemed. 
---
till it joined
 the sky
---
At the very top it was crossed at right angles by a green
" ridgeway"-- the Ickneild Street and original Roman road through the
 district. 
---
This ancient track ran east and west for many miles, and
 down almost to within living memory. 
---
But it was now neglected and
 overgrown.


---
It was known as the Brown House by the people of the
 locality. 
---
what may you want up here?
---
where the city of Christminster is,
---
if you please
---
" I wanted."

" Christminster is out across there, by that clump. 
---
You can see

---
it-- at least you can on a clear day. 
---
Ah, no, you ca n't now."


---
" You ca n't often see it in weather like this
---
it is
---
when the sun is going down in a blaze of flame
---
it looks like"


---
" The heavenly Jerusalem," suggested the serious urchin.


---
that might lie in the banks

---
that the ladder was still in its place, but
---
It was waning towards evening
---
; there was still a faint mist, but
---
it
 had cleared a little except in the damper tracts of subjacent country
 and along the river- courses. 
---
But it was hardly
 likely that the air would clear before night. 
---
for the northern expanse became lost
---
Perhaps, the wish to see Christminster might be
 forwarded. 
---
People said. 
---
if you prayed
---
that,, things sometimes came to
 you,
---
even though they sometimes did not
---
the money came in by the next post.

---
the money did not come;
 but
---
that the breeches were made by
 a wicked Jew
---
This was not discouraging, and.


---
that the mist might rise
---
In the course of ten or
 fifteen minutes the thinning mist dissolved altogether from the
 northern horizon,. 
---
as it had already done elsewhere, and about a
 quarter of an hour before the time of sunset the westward clouds
 parted
---
, the sun's position being partially uncovered, and the beams
 streaming out in visible lines between two bars of slaty cloud
---
Some way within the limits of the stretch of landscape, points of
 light like the topaz gleamed. 
---
The air increased in transparency with
 the lapse of minutes,. 
---
till the topaz points showed
---
themselves to be
 the vanes, windows, wet roof slates, and other shining spots upon the
 spires, domes, freestone- work, and varied outlines that were faintly
 revealed
---
It was Christminster, unquestionably;.


---
The spectator gazed on and on. 
---
The
 vague city became veiled in mist. 
---
that
 the sun had disappeared
---
The foreground of the scene had grown
 funereally dark, and near objects put on the hues and shapes of
 chimaeras.


---
that remutinied every night on
 board the bewitched ship
---
so that you could hardly see the poor penny
 articles exhibited within, and
---
it must rain at Christminster too
---
that it rained so drearily there
---
which was not often
---
Then the day came. 
---
It would be
 necessary to come back alone, but
---
The project was duly executed. 
---
It was not late, only just after dusk, but
---
accompanied by a wind from the same quarter
---
a black north- east
 sky,, made the occasion
 dark enough. 
---
was not the lamps in
 rows,. 
---
No individual light was visible,.


---
only
 a halo or glow- fog over- arching the place against the black heavens
 behind it,
---
the light and the city seem distant but a mile or

---
where the
 schoolmaster might be-- he who never communicated with anybody at
 Marygreen now
---
to wonder on the exact point in the glow; who was as if dead to them here. 
---
that breezes travelled at the rate of ten miles an hour
---
as if it were a sweet liquor
---
You addressing the breeze caressingly
---
"" were in
 Christminster city between one and two hours ago,; and
---
now you are here, you, the very same."


---
breathed by
 me--
---
, it seemed. 
---
Surely it
 was the sound of bells
---
They had a load of coals behind them-- a fuel that could only be got
 into the upland by this particular route. 
---
They were accompanied by a
 carter, a second man, and a boy, who now kicked a large stone behind
 one of the wheels, and allowed the panting animals to have a long
 rest,.


---
while those in charge took a flagon off the load and indulged
 in a drink round
---
if they had come from Christminster
---
" Heaven forbid, with this load!" said they.


---
" The place I mean is that one yonder." 
---
There do seem a spot a bit brighter in the nor'-east than
 elsewhere,."


---
before it grew dark
---
your head screwed on

---
t'other way before you could read
---
what they read there
---
" Oh, they never look at anything that folks like we can understand,"
. 
---
the carter continued, by way of passing the time
---
when no two families
 spoke alike
---
They read that sort of thing as fast as a night- hawk
. 
---
' Tis all learning there-- nothing but learning, except
 religion. 
---
And that's learning too,.

---
Not but there's wenches in the
 streets o' nights... 
---
You know
---
that they raise pa'sons
 there like radishes in a bed
---
though it do take-- how many years,
 Bob?-- five years
---
if it can be

---
they be
---
as they used
---
" But how should you know"

"
---
Now do n't you interrupt,
---
Move the fore hoss aside, Bobby; here's som'at coming... 
---
' Em lives on a lofty
 level; there's,. 
---
As we be here in our bodies on this high ground
---
And some on'em be strong
 young fellows that can earn a'most as much in silver cups. 
---
As for
 music, there's beautiful music everywhere in Christminster. 
---
You med

---
you med not, but
---
you ca n't help. 
---
And there's a street in the place-- the
 main street--
---
By this time the horses had recovered breath and. 
---
The waggon turned
 into
---
what has come in my way
---
Well,' tis oonly," said the carter
 unboastfully. 
---
you be welcome to it.

---
A- getting about the world, and mixing with all classes of
 society, one ca n't help. 
---
" It is a city of light
---
The tree of knowledge grows there
---
" It is."


---
what you may call a castle,
---
manned by scholarship and
 religion
---
It would just suit me
---
so you'll have. 
---
if you keep alongside of me
---
Do you know?
---
That comes of being a public
 benefactor."


---
The distances were enormous, and. 
---
you've been to Christminster, Physician?
---
" That's one of my
 centres.
---
" It's a wonderful city for scholarship and religion?"


---
" You'd say so, my boy, if you'd seen it. 
---
who do the washing of the colleges
---
that
 they may be able to read the New Testament in the original
---
You must get a grammar of each tongue.
---
Whenever you do
---
", you say. 
---
that Physician Vilbert is the only
 proprietor of those celebrated pills that infallibly cure all
 disorders of the alimentary system, as well as asthma and shortness
 of breath
---
specially licensed by the
 government stamp
---
" Can you get me the grammars?"


---
you'd better drop behind, my young man
---
if you'll remember
---
" Where will you be with the grammars?"


---
My movements are
---
as if they were
---
people meeting and
---
which is seen

---
if a supernatural lamp were held inside their transparent natures
---
that heaven lies about them then
---
The road- physician was fairly up to time; but,
---
which the pedestrian did not diminish
 by a single unit of force
---
though with the lapse of the fortnight the evenings
 had grown light
---
The quack mentally registered these with great care.


---
" You were,."


---
that you used
---
before you took your
 degree
---
You have n't brought' em
---
But you must get me some more orders from sick people, and
---
what shoddy humanity the quack was made of
---
There was to
. 
---
The disappointment was followed by an interval of blankness. 
---
it would be
 sure to reach the desired eyes. 
---
which would have the charm of being mellowed by
 the university atmosphere
---
It was
 necessary to act alone.


---
which happened
---
The piano was, and
---
that it contained two thin books
---
that the words of the required
 language were always
---
given language by those who had the art to uncover them,
---
such art
 being furnished by the books
---
that the packet bore the postmark of
 Christminster
---
which chanced
---
The book was an old one-- thirty years old,. 
---
that there was no law of transmutation,
 but

---
( there was, in some degree,
---
the grammarian did not recognize it)
---
that every word in both
 Latin and Greek was.


---
This was Latin and Greek,
---
then, was it
 this grand delusion! 
---
The charm was
 really a labour like that of Israel in Egypt.


---
What brains they must have in Christminster and the great schools
---
as the
 little sun- rays continued
---
Somebody might have come along that way. 
---
But nobody did come,
; and
---
because nobody does
---
During the three or four succeeding years a quaint and singular
 vehicle might have been discerned.


---
under which the ideas lay
 in those dusty volumes called the classics
---
the
 business of the little cottage bakery had grown in consequence. 
---
An
 aged horse with a hanging head had been purchased for eight pounds at
 a sale, a creaking cart with a whity- brown tilt obtained for a few
 pounds more, and
---
The only copies were old Delphin
 editions,. 
---
because they were superseded, and therefore cheap
---
But,
 bad for idle schoolboys, it did so happen. 
---
the people of the neighbourhood
 began
---
There were murmurs. 
---
that it was the constable's duty, and

---
The only thing to be done was,
 therefore,. 
---
as
 anybody loomed in the distance
---
The light had changed, and
---
The sun was going
 down, and
---
the full moon was rising simultaneously behind the woods in
 the opposite quarter. 
---
that, in a moment of the same impulsive emotion which years
 before had caused
---
that nobody was in sight
---
:


" Phoebe silvarumque potens Diana!"



---
The horse stood still.


---
which had led
 to such a lapse from common sense and custom in one who wished, next
 to being a scholar
---
the strange forgetfulness, to be a Christian divine. 
---
It had all come of
 reading heathen works exclusively. 
---
Certainly there seemed little harmony between this pagan
 literature and the mediæ val colleges at Christminster, that
 ecclesiastical romance in stone.


---
obtained by post from a
 second- hand bookseller
---
What was most required by citizens? 
---
An income from any work in preparing the first would be too meagre
---
They built in a city
---
that contained the
 scholar souls
---
There was a stone- mason of a humble kind in Alfredston, and as

---
It was fine, warm, and soft summer weather, and
---
This was true,

---
there was only one dialect all the same
---
" These things are only a beginning. 
---
Once there so advance
---
that my present knowledge will appear to me but as childish
 ignorance
---
one of those colleges
 shall open its doors to me--.


---
now it would spurn,

---
Well, on second thoughts, a bishop was
 absurd. 
---
The sounds were expressed in light
 voices on the other side of the hedge, but
---
and it is that....
---
which tells
---
Yes, Christminster shall be my
 Alma Mater; and
---
as though the future were thrown thereon by a magic
 lantern
---
what it was-- a piece of flesh, the characteristic
 part of a barrow- pig, which the countrymen used for greasing their
 boots,
---
as it was useless for any other purpose
---
Pigs were rather
 plentiful hereabout,.


---
the first time realized,
---
a garden and pig- sties attached
---
One or two pairs of
 eyes slyly glanced up, and and
---
perceiving that at last
 been attracted,, they braced themselves
 for inspection by putting their mouths demurely into shape and
 recommencing their rinsing operations with assiduity.


---
I DIDN'T throw it
---
" Nor I," the second answered.


---
can you
---
Oh, Anny, how!" said the third.


---
", it should n't have been THAT!"


---
And they laughed and.


---
" YOU did n't do it--
---
That you'll never be told
---
" Whoever did it was wasteful of other people's property."


---
" Oh, that's nothing."


---
" But you want
---
if you like to
---
will you come to the plank above here?"


---
when the last intention of
 their lives is
---
what is lying there
---
They walked in
 parallel lines, one on each bank of the stream, towards the small
 plank bridge. 
---
This production of dimples at will was a not unknown
 operation, which many attempted, but only a few succeeded in
 accomplishing.


---
They met in the middle of the plank, and
---
as it clutched the rail of the bridge
---
" You do n't think
---
What made
---
either of the others throw it
---
it was I, mind
---
me wash the
 innerds for black- puddings and such like
---
They talked a little more and a little more,. 
---
as they stood each other and
---
though the words had

---
" Ah, you should see me Sundays!
---
That's
---
for you to think on
---
There's nobody after me just now,
." 
---
though there med
---
the dimples disappeared.


---
" Will
 you let me?"


---
" To- morrow, that is?"


---
The intentions as to reading, working, and
 learning,, were suffering a curious collapse into a corner
---
" Well, it's only a bit of fun
---
It had

---
while, as by the light of a falling lamp one might momentarily see an
 inscription on a wall before being enshrouded in darkness
---
And then
 this passing discriminative power was withdrawn, and
---
this enkindling one of the other sex on the following Sunday
---
though you med
---
to be a scholar, they say.
---
Do n't you think
 it, my child!"


---
" Oh, I do n't care, or anything about' n. " Oh, do n't ye! 
---
You need n't try! 
---
What did you stay
? 
---
if you did n't want un

Whether you do or
---
whether
 you do n't
---
as you courted
 on the bridge
---
as amended by numerous correctors
---
as a snake must feel
---
who has sloughed off its winter
 skin, and
---
which was very winning, apart from
 promises
---
Indeed, it would be
 impossible,.


---
This seemed, and.



---
HÊ KAINÊ DIATHÊKÊ was no more heeded, and
---
A smell of piggeries came from the back, and. 
---
Courting in such a businesslike aspect as
 it evidently wore to the speaker
---
" courting"
 was too coolly purposeful.

---
The door was opened and
---
would n't you?
---
" We'll walk up to the Brown House and back
---
, we can
 do it in half an hour."


---
all the misgivings vanished.


---
that there were any such people in
 the mythology, or
---
An indescribable lightness
 of heel served; and
---
glorified by the condescension of this handsome country

---
While looking over the vast northern landscape from
 this spot they were struck by the rising of a dense volume of smoke
 from the neighbourhood of the little town which lay beneath them at a
 distance of a couple of miles.


---
" It is a fire
---
's run and
---
It is not
 far!"


---
They started off down the hill almost at
 a trot; but
---
on gaining level ground at the bottom, and walking a
 mile, they found.


---
that the spot of the fire was much further off
---
than
 it had seemed
---
Having begun their journey, however, they pushed on; but
---
it was not
 till five o'clock,--. 
---
that they found themselves on the scene
---
The conflagration had been got under
 by the time they reached it, and after a short inspection of the
 melancholy ruins they retraced their steps-- their course lying
 through the town of Alfredston.


---
they entered an inn of an
 inferior class, and. 
---
As it was not for beer
---
they
 had a long time to wait. 
---
who kept hisself up so particular
---
The latter
 guessed, and
---
what was being said
---
They sat and and at the picture of Samson and
 Delilah which hung on the wall, and at the circular beer- stains on
 the table, and at the spittoons underfoot filled with sawdust. 
---
no liquor is going, and
---
It began. 
---
They could not wait longer, really, for the
 tea
---
, they said. 
---
" Yet what else can we do?
---
" It is a
 three- mile walk for you."


---
we can have some beer
---
" I suppose," said Arabella.

" Beer, oh yes. 
---
Somehow it seems odd."


---
I had forgotten that. " But we did n't."


---
" No, we did n't."
---
" What's the matter with it?"
---
, it is true. 
---
it is bad, and
---
But this seems
 all right."


---
" How much you know!"
---
they
 went on their way. 
---
It was now nearly dark, and as soon as they had
 withdrawn from the lights of the town they walked closer together,
. 
---
till they touched each other
---
as it rested in its place
---
" Now we are well together, dear
---
, are n't we?
---
Thus they walked. 
---
till they reached the foot of the upland, where they
 could see the white highway ascending before them in the gloom
---
Before they
 had climbed far
---
" These lovers-- you find'em out o' doors in all seasons and
 weathers-- lovers and homeless dogs only
---
they vanished down the hill
---
" Are we lovers?
---
" You know best."


---
" But you can tell me?"


---
They walked now no longer arm in arm but,. 
---
After all, what did it matter
---
since it was dark
---
When they were half- way up the long hill they paused as
 by arrangement, and
---
They reached the top, and

---
" You can keep your arm there,
---
if you would like to
---
It was nine o'clock.


---
as it would seem so
 odd otherwise, and
---
Immediately that the door was opened.

---
several neighbours sitting round
---
They all spoke in a congratulatory manner, and.


---
bidding them all good night
 plunged with a sense of relief into the track over the down.


---
, hitherto adhered to so strictly,? 
---
It depended on your
 point of view. 
---
It was better;
---
As
 the sun had only just risen
---
it was possible. 
---
that nobody had passed
 there since
---
as they had stood
---
A pollard willow stood close to the place,
 and
---
that willow was different from all other willows in the world.

---
which must elapse
---
" You've got,' nation!"

---
if you han't
---
" It's well!"


---
What med
---
" be the right way?
---
Oh you do n't know
---
"-- you do n't!"
---
said Sarah, the third girl.


---
"' Tis clear!" said Anny.

" And! 
---
as one may say
---
Well, we can teach
' ee som'at then, as well as you us."


---
" A countryman; God
 forbid! 
---
although nobody was near
---
You'd be safe enough with yours. 
---
I
 wish I had the chance!  do you think?"


---
they'd
 get married at all
---
that three young unfattened pigs had
 escaped from their sty by leaping clean over the top, and
---
The animals took advantage
 of the pause by doubling and bolting out of the way.


---
" I'll try it!"" They were only put in this morning!"
---
They are wanting! 
---
Will you shut
 the garden gate, dear, and help me to get'em in. 
---
they'll be lost
---
if we do n't mind
---
Every now and then they ran together,
. 
---
The first pig was
;
---
got back promptly the second with some difficulty; the third a
 long- legged creature, was more obstinate and agile. 
---
me take your hand, darling
---
" You are getting out of
 breath." 
---
they trotted along together.


---
This comes of driving'em home
---
" They always know
 the way back. 
---
if you do that
---
They ought."


---
as the pursuers had entered and
---
As soon ascended to the
 top of the high ground it became apparent's. 
---
that they would have
---
if they wished
---
long before we get
 there
---
It do n't matter now
---
we know. 
---
They'll see. 
---
it is ours, and
---
" We've run all this way for nothing
---
" Well-- why do n't
 you speak, deary?"


---
It was all up hill."


---
They were in absolute solitude-- the most apparent of all solitudes,
 that of empty surrounding space. 
---
They were, in fact, on one of the
 summits of the county, and
---
the distant landscape around Christminster
 could be discerned from where they lay. 
---
" A
 sort of a-- caterpillar, of the most loveliest green and yellow you
 ever came across!"


---
"-- you must come here
---
where it branches off
---
" How stupid you are!"
---
you to let
---
me kiss you
---
before a little glass hung on
 the mullion of the window
---
' ee running with
' un-- hee- hee
---
tis coming to something
---
" Have you heard that lately-- quite lately?
---
When the gossip had departed
---
you and Father to go and
---
how the Edlins be,
---
-- there's evening service at Fensworth--
---
you
 can walk to that."


---
What's up to- night, then?
---
when you are here
---
If it is fine
---
" we med,."


---
since you wish
---
who had now
 for weeks
---
They wandered up the slopes, Jude thinking of the great age of the trackway,
 and of the drovers who had frequented it,. 
---
till they reached the green
 track along the ridge, which they followed to the circular British
 earth- bank adjoining
---
probably before the Romans
 knew the country
---
Presently they were reduced to one note,
 which quickened, and stopped.


---
" Now we'll go back
---
Why are you in such a hurry to go in to- night? 
---
It is not
 near dark."


---
it locked
---
" Ah-- they are gone to church
---
" Now, you'll come
 in a moment?
---
" We shall be all alone."


---
Indoors they went. 
---
No, it was too late
---
they sat down-- naturally enough close together.


---
" What is it?"
---
it will get hatched in less than three
 weeks.
---
I am hatching a very rare sort.  I carry it
 about everywhere with me, and" Where do you carry it?"

" Just here." 
---
which was wrapped in wool
---
it being a piece of pig's bladder
---
you do n't come near me
---
it broke
---
I do n't want, and
" Why do you do such a strange thing?"


---
" It's an old custom. 
---
it is natural
---
I suppose."

" It is very awkward for me just now
---
" It serves you right. 
---
There-- that's all you can have of me"


---
" That's very shabby of you!"


---
" You should have catched me a minute ago!

---
Then there was a little struggle,. 
---
" I am without it now They looked at each other,;!"


---
One kiss,
 now I can do it without damage to property; and I'll go" You must find me first!"
---
It was now dark inside the
 room, and
---
the window being small
---
till a laugh revealed
---
It was some two months later in the year, and
---
the pair had met
 constantly during the interval. 
---
it will be better both for you and for me. 
---
some things had

---
But it is never too late
."


---
" How do you know?"
---
it is not too late
---
" That's all very well! 
---
if you desert me
---
how can you say that, my dear! 
---
You KNOW
---
, you know;
---
if that's the case
---
But, of course, we must
 marry! 
---
What other thing do you think?"


---
", perhaps you would go away all the more
 for that, and!"


---
" You knew better! 
---
It is a complete smashing up of my plans--
---
But what are they, after all!

---
Certainly we'll marry
---
: we must!"


---
The banns were put in and. 
---
The people
 of the parish all said. 
---
who guessed the probable state of affairs
---
Those,
, declared. 
---
who married them
---
The
 parson seemed. 
---
that at every
 other time of their lives till death took them
---
, they would assuredly
 believe,
---
precisely as they had believed,
---
What was as remarkable
.


---
as the undertaking itself was the fact that nobody seemed at all
 surprised at what they swore
---
that it would have been far better if, instead of his

---
But the urgent need of adding to income in ever so
 little a degree caused. 
---
it was a long way to walk to and from Alfredston every day.

---
that all these make- shifts were temporary
---
where so much of the hard labour at
 Greek and Latin had been carried on
---
" What-- it was n't your own?"
---
" Oh no-- it never is nowadays with the better class."

" Nonsense! 
---
But in the country it is supposed
. 
---
Besides, you've enough of your own, surely?"


---
as country notions go
---
to draw the drink at a
 public- house there-- just for a little time; that was all. 
---
Some
 people put me up to getting this, and
---
The more you have the better in Aldbrickham, which is a finer town
 than all your Christminsters. 
---
Every lady of position wears false
 hair--."


---
the barber's assistant told me so
---
though this might be
 true to some extent
---
Others, alas, had an
 instinct towards artificiality in their very blood, and. 
---
even though the prospects of the household ways and means
 are cloudy
---
As usual they laughed before talking
---
; the world seemed funny to them
 without saying it.


---
" So it turned out a good plan,!". 
---
you see
---
you ought."


---
" And when do you expect?"


---
" Oh, Arabella, Arabella; you be a deep one! 
---
well, that's
 clever
---
-- it's a real stroke of genius! 
---
It is a thing I never thought

---
" Do n't you be too quick to cry sham! '
---
Whatever it was
---
it was a trick-- a double one, by
 the Lord
---
What can'em do otherwise? 
---
Married is
 married."


---
that the alarm had been without foundation
---
The occasion was one evening at bedtime, and
---
" There is no harm in
 it, but
---
you were awake
---
" How countrified you are! 
---
That's nothing."


---
" Where did you learn it?"


---
They used; but
---
now they wo n't. 
---
My face was fatter
 then."


---
if they do
---
How do you know?"


---
" Ah-- that public- house experience accounts for your knowing about
 the adulteration of the ale. 
---
when we went and
---
" You ought, and.

---
There was not much to do at home, and
---
" You'll soon have plenty to do now, dear
---
, wo n't you?"


---
" How do you mean?"


---
" Oh."

" When will it be? 
---
Ca n't you tell me exactly, instead of in such
 general terms as you have used?
---
" There's nothing to tell. 
---
" It was a mistake."


---
" How can that be?"


---
if it had not been for the news you gave me, which made it necessary
 to save you, ready or no...  Good God
---
What's done
---
ca n't be undone.
---
there was silence
 between them.


---
otherwise while ordinary notions prevailed
---
But how came they to
?


---
But
 the marriage remained.




---
as it was light in the morning
---
The night had seemed strangely silent. 
---
that the ground was covered with
 snow--
---
, it seemed,
---
a few flakes still
 falling.


---
You must get up and. 
---
if you want

---
that as
 yet lived,
---
whose voice could be continually heard from a corner
 of the garden. 
---
the water boiled, and
---
Is Challow
---
They waited, and
---
it grew lighter, with the dreary light of a snowy
 dawn. 
---
Drunk last night, I expect. 
---
" Then we must put it off. 
---
It is.

---
only the water boiled for nothing
---
The snow may be deep in the valley.
---
There's no more victuals for the pig. 
---
We always do it the last day or two,. 
---
What ignorance, not to know that!"


---
" Well-- you must do the sticking
---
-- there's no help for it. 
---
as it is
 such a big pig I had rather
---
Though Challow had done it. 
---
we can use
' em."


---
Of course you sha n't do it
---
since it must
 be done
---
who, beginning with a squeak of surprise, rose to
 repeated cries of rage
---
together
 they hoisted the victim on to the stool,
---
The animal's note changed its quality. 
---
It was not now rage, but the
 cry of despair; long- drawn, slow and hopeless.


---
There's the sticking- knife--
 the one with the point. 
---
whatever you do
---
That's
 the chief thing.
---
" You must not!"
---
" The meat must be well bled, and. 
---
We shall lose a shilling a score! 
---
if the meat
 is red and bloody
---
Just touch the vein, that's all. 
---
Every good butcher keeps un.

---
, however the meat may
 look
---
the butchers do
---
You've

---
However unworkmanlike the deed, it had been mercifully done. 
---
The dying animal's cry assumed its third and final
 tone, the shriek of agony;.


---
un stop that
---
" Such a noise will bring
 somebody or other up here, and
---
people to know
---
we are

---
The pig was instantly silent,.


---
That's better
---
" It is a hateful business!"
---
" Pigs must be killed."


---
The animal heaved in a final convulsion, and, despite the rope. 
---
A tablespoonful of black
 clot came forth,
---
the trickling of red blood having ceased for some
 seconds.


---
That's it
---
" Artful creatures-- they always
 keep back a drop like that as long as they can!"


---
There's a waste, all through you!"


---
only about a third of the whole
 steaming liquid was left in it, the main part being splashed over
 the snow, and forming a dismal, sordid, ugly spectacle-- to those who
 saw it as other than an ordinary obtaining of meat. 
---
What's
---
" God got,
---
" Poor folks must live."


---
Suddenly they became aware of a voice at hand.


---
which was husky
---
The voice,,
 came from the garden- gate, and
---
they saw.


---
the burly form of Mr. Challow leaning over the gate,

---
"' Tis well for' ee to stand there and glane!"
---
your being late
---
" You should have waited a bit"
," and. '
---
that you be in at present, ma'am
---
Tis risking yourself
 too much."


---
You need n't be concerned about that
---
that the deed would have amounted to the same thing. 
---
if carried out by
 deputy
---
the matter was
---
there was nothing the matter
---
The suggestion was horridly
 unpleasant, and
---
" An apprentice's wages are not meant."


---
" Then you should n't have had one."


---
That's too bad,.
---
when you know
---
how it came about
---
Doctor Vilbert thought so. 
---
It was a good job for you!"


---
that it was n't
 so
---
it was not your fault
---
those women friends of yours gave
 you bad advice. 
---
If they had n't, or
---
you had n't taken it
---
, we should at
 this moment have been free from a bond which, not to mince matters,
. 
---
It may be very sad, but
---
it is true."


---
" Who's been telling you about my friends? 
---
you shall
---
" But-- you ought to. 
---
It is mean of' ee not to!"


---
us say no more about it
---
" That was nothing. 
---
The
 risk is hers.
---
when effects stretch so far
---
" What ought I?"


---
Why do you fuss yourself about melting down that
 pig's fat to- night? 
---
It wo n't keep."


---
which was Sunday
---
the renewed work recalled the conversation which had
.


---
" That's the story about me in Marygreen,
---
is it--?

---
you were
---
Much of a catch, Lord send!" 
---
where they ought not
---
" You might have thrown them
 aside, but
---
if you had liked
---
as to soiling them like that, it is
 disgusting!" 
---
me go
---
me go
---
It was a fine Sunday morning, dry, clear and frosty, and

---
the bells of Alfredston Church could be heard on the breeze from the
 north. 
---
People were going along the road,
---
when they sported along the same track some months earlier
---
These pedestrians turned
---
One of the passers said in
 mock terror:"!"


---
Good Lord deliver us
---
that all
 was over between them, and
---
that it mattered, or
---
Their lives were ruined:
 that of having based a permanent contract on a temporary feeling
 which had no necessary connection with affinities that alone render
 a lifelong comradeship tolerable.


---
ruined by the fundamental error of their matrimonial union
---
All you be a queer lot as husbands and wives!"


---
" Who's been telling you that?"
---
it spoken of
---
" You med so well
---
There is n't much to know
 after all. 
---
they
 parted. 
---
It was coming home from Alfredston market,. 
---
when you were a
 baby-- on the hill by the Brown House barn--
---
that they had their last
 difference, and
---
The Fawleys were not made for
 wedlock
---
: it never seemed. 
---
that wo n't take kindly to the notion of being bound to do what
 we do readily enough if not bound
---
That's
---
you ought
---
A gibbet once stood. 
---
there not onconnected with
 our history
---
that be
---
The frost continued,
. 
---
though it was not particularly sharp, and
---
the larger stars overhead
 came out slow and flickering
---
The cracking repeated itself; but
---
the cracking had ceased. 
---
It was curious
---
Of course that was it
---
Drinking was the regular, stereotyped resource of the despairing
 worthless. 
---
The house was in darkness, and
---
though the marks of pig- dressing, of fats and
 scallops, were visible
---
that,, the materials themselves had been taken away
---
A line was
 pinned to the cotton blower of the fireplace:


---
"_ Have gone to my friends. 
---
The next day went in the same way, and the next. 
---
the
 pig- jobbing business being a poor one nowadays
---
They had at last
 decided, and
---
which was not much
---
that there was
---
" Oh," said the broker,. 
---
" It is a small lot of stuff that was knocked down to me at a cottage
 sale out on the road to Marygreen
---
The frame is a very useful one,
.
---
if you take out the likeness
---
You shall have it for a shilling."


---
that it would be better otherwise
---
, which perhaps was true
---
It seemed.


---
A milestone, now
 as always, stood at the roadside hard by. 
---
if the inscription were legible still, and
---
Bene agere et
 loetari_--to do good cheerfully--,
---
There actually rose the faint halo, a
 small dim nebulousness, hardly recognizable save by the eye of faith.

---
Grey- stoned and
 dun- roofed, it stood within hail of the Wessex border, and almost
 with the tip of one small toe within it, at the northernmost point of
 the crinkled line along which the leisurely Thames strokes the fields
 of that ancient kingdom. 
---
The buildings now lay quiet in the sunset,
 a vane here and there on their many spires and domes giving sparkle
 to a picture of sober secondary and tertiary hues.


---
which had sent into

---
some tea sallied forth
---
It was a windy, whispering, moonless night. 
---
The breeze ruffled and
, but
---
It was a college,. 
---
which no lamplight reached
---
as it
 were with the breath and sentiment of the venerable city
---
A bell began, and
---
it was meant
 for a hundred
---
When the gates were shut, and
---
The minutes
 passed, fewer and fewer people were visible, and
---
what mattered a night's rest for once
---
the flash of a lamp would show crocketed
 pinnacles and indented battlements. 
---
whose very existence seemed

---
, there would jut into the path porticoes, oriels,
 doorways of enriched and florid middle- age design, their extinct air
 being accentuated by the rottenness of the stones. 
---
It seemed
 impossible that modern thought could house itself in such decrepit
 and superseded chambers.


---
with which the nooks were haunted
---
that could be read and
---
who had spent their youth within these

---
whose souls had haunted them in their maturer
 age
---
The
 brushings of the wind against the angles, buttresses, and door- jambs
 were as the passing of these only other inhabitants,. 
---
the tappings
 of each ivy leaf on its neighbour were as the mutterings of their
 mournful souls, the shadows as their thin shapes in nervous movement,

---
In the gloom it was.


---
who knew each quad as well as the faithful, and

---
as it were
---
what voice it
 was, and
---
what it betokened
---
so far as solid
 flesh went
---
What med
---
you be up to?"


---
who
 afterwards mourned Christminster as" the home of lost causes,"
---
my impression is... 
---
that my duty towards a
 country threatened with famine
---
that that which has been
---
the
 ordinary remedy under all similar circumstances should be resorted to
 now, namely,
---
Deprive me of office to- morrow, you
 can never deprive me of the consciousness that I have exercised the
 powers committed to me from no corrupt or interested motives, from no
 desire to gratify ambition, for no personal gain."


---
Then the sly author of the immortal Chapter on Christianity:" How
 shall we excuse the supine inattention of the Pagan and philosophic
 world, to those evidences[ miracles] which were presented by
 Omnipotence?... 
---
The sages of Greece and Rome turned aside from the
 awful spectacle, and."


---
Then the shade of the poet, the last of the optimists:


    How the world is made for each of us!

       
---
*    *    *

    And each of the Many helps.



---
" My argument was... that absolute certitude as to the truths of
 natural theology."


---
which did not reach
 to logical certainty
---
that probabilities might create a mental certitude
---
Why should we faint, and
---
so Heaven has
---
fear to live alone,
    Since all alone, will'd, we die?



---
some phrases spoken by the phantom with the short
 face, the genial Spectator:

" When I look upon the tombs of the great, every motion of envy dies
 in me
---
, my heart melts with compassion;
---
And lastly a gentle- voiced prelate spoke, during whose meek, familiar
 rhyme,,
---
The ghostly past seemed and
---
everything spoke of to- day. 
---
II


 Necessary meditations on the actual, including the mean
 bread- and- cheese question, dissipated the phantasmal for a while, and

---
the only kind deemed
 by many of its professors to be work at all.


---
that the
 colleges had treacherously changed their sympathetic countenances
---
:
 some were pompous
---
; some had put on the look of family vaults above
 ground; something barbaric loomed in the masonries of all. 
---
who knew their beginning
---
they were difficult or easy in
 the working
---
What at night had been perfect and ideal
---
was by day the more or
 less defective real. 
---
Cruelties, insults, had. 
---
They were
.


---
the
 morning had nearly gone. 
---
It was, in one sense,. 
---
The yard was a little centre of regeneration. 
---
These were the ideas in
 modern prose which the lichened colleges presented in old poetry.

---
Even some of those antiques might have been called prose. 
---
when they
 were new
---
They had done nothing but wait, and.

---
the bankers half worked, or
---
They were marked
 by precision, mathematical straightness, smoothness, exactitude:

---
as that dignified by the
 name of scholarly study within the noblest of the colleges
---
that at best only copying, patching and
 imitating went on here;
---
that
 mediæ valism was as dead as a fern- leaf in a lump of coal
---
in which Gothic
 architecture and its associations had no place
---
There remained the schoolmaster-- probably now a reverend parson.

---
But the saints and prophets in the window- tracery, the paintings
 in the galleries, the statues, the busts, the gargoyles, the
 corbel- heads-- these seemed. 
---
as it had been called
---
It was not till now,. 
---
who had nothing to do from morning till night but
---
them
 going and
---
their
 voices, marked their movements
---
The conversation of some of the
 more thoughtful among them seemed oftentimes,,. 
---
But the future lay ahead after all; and
---
,
 colleges included:. 
---
when the nights reeked
 with the raw and cold air from the Meadows
---
the one
 thing necessary was,
 and
---
whatever chances were afforded to such an one of becoming
 a son of the University
---
money is a
 defence; but
---
the excellency of knowledge is,." 
---
that wisdom giveth life
 to them that have it
---
who was
 suspiciously like the original of the portrait
---
The shop seemed. 
---
It contained
 Anglican books, stationery, texts, and fancy goods: little plaster
 angels on brackets, Gothic- framed pictures of saints, ebony crosses

---
that were almost crucifixes, prayer- books that were almost missals.

---
which engaged
---
The lettering on
 was clearly intended.


---
It would have been easy,
 but
---
the fact of lent a pathetic force to a wish that would have been inoperative as
 an argument.


---
And how possible it was.


---
as
 far as a Christian could
---
;
 all was nervous motion. 
---
London had done it
---
since there were

---
The first reason was, and
---
it would be wrong.

---
The second was. 
---
that they were cousins
---
It was not well for cousins
 to fall in love.

---
even when circumstances seemed
---
where marriage
 usually meant a tragic sadness, marriage with
---
a tragic sadness might be
 intensified to a tragic horror.


---
as some one to be proud of
---
later on, to be invited to tea by,
---
while the bell was
 going
---
In quo corriget_, the organ changing to a pathetic Gregorian
 tune as the singers gave forth:


   
---
Wherewithal shall
---
it to lead
 to such disastrous consequences
---
The great waves of
 pedal music tumbled round the choir, and,
---
nursed on the supernatural
, it is not wonderful. 
---
And yet it was
 the ordinary psalm for the twenty- fourth evening of the month.


---
which promised
---
that the atmosphere blew as distinctly from Cyprus as from Galilee
---
For though it had seemed, and
---
that the kinship was affectation
---
It ca n't be
---
It was with some heartache.




---
It was one of those cloudless days which
 sometimes occur in Wessex and elsewhere between days of cold and wet,
. 
---
as if intercalated by caprice of the weather- god
---
The road passed between green fields,
 and.


---
as they
 could stand
---
They were in the main reduced copies of ancient marbles, and
. 
---
them being a Venus of
 standard pattern, a Diana
---
" How much are these two?
---
When they were paid for, and
---
so that appeared
---
gathered by a zealous lover of nature
---
" Well, anything is better than those everlasting church fallals!"
---
which had occurred several years
 before this date
---
just as the other was hastily

---
you have been buying
---

 Miss Fontover, looking round at the Gothic- framed prints of saints,
 the Church- text scrolls, and other articles which, having become too
 stale to sell.

" What
 is it?

Where did you get them?"

if
 there's light enough afterwards

It was a volume of Gibbon, and
---
there happening, and,

---
as if the scene suggested the action
---
the familiar poem--


    Thou hast conquered,
---
The world has grown grey from thy breath!



---
every time there was enough
 diffused light from the street to show her the white plaster figures,
 standing on the chest of drawers in odd contrast to their environment
 of text and martyr, and the Gothic- framed Crucifix- picture that was
 only discernible now as a Latin cross
---
, the figure thereon being
 obscured by the shades.


---
On one of these occasions the church clocks struck some small hour.

 Till the sounds rolled with reverent loudness, as a book was heard
 to close:--

"_ Kai heis Kurios Iesous Christos, di hou ta panta kai hemeis di

as artizans in
 country- towns are apt to be
---
who carves the boss
 or knob of leafage
---
as if it were a degradation to do the second
 half of one whole

When there was not much Gothic moulding for

There was a short
 morning service, and

when the parson entered

till the prayer should be ended

that made

immediately the worshipers began

---
who was beginning
---
But it was also obvious;
---
what was erratic, informal, and
 unexpected
---
A voice whispered.


---
There was not. 
---
the situation was growing immoral
---
It was quite
 impossible. 
---
when
 your heart's desire was
---
" After all" it is not altogether
 an_ erotolepsy_ that is the matter with me, as at that first time.

---
it is partly a wish
 for intellectual sympathy, and a craving for loving- kindness in my
 solitude." 
---
that
 it was human perversity
---
It so happened.

---
Why-- that's my cousin Sue
---
which, simple and commonplace in themselves, are seen

---
The very unconsciousness of a looming drama, or_ vice versa_, makes
 them,, and
---
when such a drama follows
---
they are read over by the purple
 or lurid light of it, all the more impressive, solemn, and in cases,
 terrible.


---
They might have had such nice times together
---
so that the chance of companionship would be lost perhaps
 for ever.


---
However, it could not
 be helped now, and
---
The broad street was silent, and almost deserted, although it was
 not late. 
---
they both converged towards the crossmark at the same
 moment. 
---
The voice, though positive and silvery, had been tremulous. 
---
They
 walked on in parallel lines, and,
---
though there
 was none on the spot then
---
it would save time

---
if we were going
---
was--
---
you chose
---
that the
 place was so horrid
---
But is n't it
 funny to begin like this,?" 
---
" You seem

" And you knew, and? 
---
That's unfortunate. 
---
Surely it is impossible! 
---
" Yes-- it is
---
As we are going
---
we go and
---
" It is not late."


---
they went along up a hill, and through some prettily
 wooded country. 
---
Presently the embattled tower and square turret
 of the church rose into the sky, and then the school- house.
---
They
 inquired of a person in the street. 
---
," said the school- master
 thoughtfully. 
---
" You were one of my pupils
---
, you say? 
---
but they number so many thousands by this time of my life, and
---
Yes, no doubt;
 but they number so many thousands by this time of my life, and have
 naturally changed so much, that I remember very few except the quite
 recent ones."

" It was out at Marygreen
---
And is this an old pupil, too?"


---
" No-- that's my cousin... 
---
you sent them?"


---
" Ah-- yes!--I do dimly recall that incident.
---
" It was very kind. 
---
of you to do it
---
And it was you. 
---
who first started
 me on that course
---
On the morning you left Marygreen,
---
when your
 goods were on the waggon
---
, you wished me good- bye, and."


---
your
 scheme was
---
that a degree
 was the necessary hall- mark of one who wanted to do anything as a
 theologian or teacher
---
The idea was given up years ago.
---
It was that- night."


---
which brought me to this
 part of the country, and
---
They entered the parlour of the school- house, where there was a lamp
 with a paper shade, which threw the light down on three or four
 books. 
---
so that they could see each other
 better, and
---
which from continued frictions shone a little at
 the shoulder- blades, the middle of the back, and the elbows
---
They did not stay to supper,
---
before it grew
 late
---
the road was retraced to Christminster. 
---
Though they had

---
the gloom of the walk home
 lay not in the night overhead,
---
" Why must you leave Christminster?"
---
" Yes-- they do. 
---
Though how large do they loom in the history of the
 world?... 
---
" Miss Fontover, one of the
 partners, is offended with me, and
---
" How did that happen?"


---
though it was my property
---
because it was not, and
---
the end of it
 was."


---
" Why do n't you try? 
---
You once did
---
If you like it, and
---
go to a training college, and become a
 first- class certificated mistress, you get twice as large an income
 as any designer or church artist, and twice as much freedom.
---
We need n't?"


---
because our parents
 did, need we

The school- master was unprepared for such a proposal.


---
was a second year's transfer,
---
as it is called
---
" Of course your cousin would do, personally; but
---
the salary being merely nominal.


---
who took more and more warmly to the idea of tuition; and
---
both being modern erections
---
The arrangement had
 been concluded very quickly. 
---
who was
---
All such provisional arrangements as these
 could only last till the next annual visit of H.M. Inspector,. 
---
whose
 approval was necessary
---
what master- tradesman does not wish?


---
It was a little over half- past eight o'clock in the morning and
---
A new emanation,
, seemed. 
---
The regulation was,
 indeed, not easy to evade,.


---
for there was no other sitting- room in the
 dwelling
---
Sometimes-- it was arithmetic that they were working
 at
---
Then it happened. 
---
that the children were

---
to which schools were admitted at

---
The afternoon was one of sun and dust, and
---
when they
 entered the exhibition room
---
few people were present but themselves.

---
The model of the ancient city stood in the middle of the apartment,
 and
---
known to them by name
 from reading their Bibles
---
The spot was Calvary.


---
How does anybody know? 
---
that Jerusalem was
 like this in the time of Christ
---
" It is made after the best conjectural maps, based on actual visits
 to the city as it now exists.
---
we have had enough of Jerusalem
---
There was nothing first- rate about
 the place, or people, after all--."


---
as there was about Athens, Rome,
 Alexandria, and other old cities
---
what it is to us
---
we have had enough of
 Jerusalem
---
" Jude-- how seriously you are going into it!"


---
" These are your school- children,
 of course! 
---
that schools were admitted in the afternoons,
---
you might come
---
How it carries one back
---
, does n't it! 
---
-- there are too many of that sort now!
---
that it was
---
what you do n't understand
---
you are quite right
---
YOU believe in me
---
The model wore too much of an educational aspect for the children not
 to tire of it soon, and
---
a little later in the afternoon they were all
 marched back to Lumsdon,. 
---
Meanwhile the scholars and teachers moved homewards, and
---
with every building shown in its place
---
you took no interest in the model, and
---
" It is more than I had remembered myself."


---
two days later, in the middle of the morning lessons,
 the latch of the door was softly lifted, and.


---
; the inspector therefore came and. 
---
that an oft- dreaded moment
 had come
---
when the inspector had gone
---
there was a reaction, and
---
" You ought
---
that one of the
 inspector's surprise- visits was imminent
---
You are the best teacher
 ever I had!"


---
The trees overhead
 deepened the gloom of the hour, and
---
On turning the corner and entering the village the first sight was that of two figures under one umbrella coming
 out of the vicarage gate. 
---
they had evidently
 been paying a visit to the vicar-- probably on some business connected
 with the school work. 
---
as they walked along the wet and deserted

---
it
 remain,
---
who
 sank into the hedge like one struck with a blight
---
many a happy marriage had been made
 in such conditions of age. 
---
The
 little bakery business had been sold to a neighbour, and
---
It was not
---
till the time had nearly come

---
They were living here at that time.

---
' ee ask that?
---
This is no sight for modest eyes!'
---
And
 there'll be a worse thing

if you, tied and

as you be

If your cousin is civil to you

it is stark madness for' ee

---
that you could see un a'most before your very eyes
---
You too,
 Jude, had the same trick as a child of seeming to see things in the
 air."


---
you know
---
They'd try. 
---
But' a would n't come."


---
It being Sunday evening
---
some villagers were standing in a group in their best clothes. 
---
" Ye've got there right enough, then!"


---
you used
---
Is it all you expected of it?"


---
auld crumbling buildings, half church, half almshouse, and not
 much going on at that."


---
You are wrong, John
---
; there is
---
It is a unique centre of thought
 and religion-- the intellectual and spiritual granary of this country.

---
All that silence and absence of goings- on is the stillness of
 infinite motion-- the sleep of the spinning- top, to borrow the simile
 of a well- known writer."


---
" Oh, well, it med
---
be all that, or
---
it med not. 
---
it was time to come along home
---
You've j'ined a college by this
 time
---
" Just what we thought! 
---
Such places be not for such as you-- only for
 them with plenty o' money."


---
There you are wrong
---
" They are
 for such ones!"


---
It was decidedly necessary. 
---
" It would have been better,
 or
---
some arm to be stretched out from them to

---
This hovering outside the walls of the
 colleges, as if expecting lift me inside,! 
---
What at first seemed. 
---
an
 opportunity occurred one afternoon
---
The gentleman came nearer, and
---
It seemed benign, considerate, yet
 rather reserved. 
---
what a wise thing it would be, and
---
from those whose
 physiognomies seemed. 
---
When the letters were posted
---
they had not been sent
---
" It is just one of those
 intrusive, vulgar, pushing, applications which are so common in these
 days
---
Perhaps that's!"


---
that it was perfectly absurd to expect,
---
What this meant
---
whether, as seemed possible, it was a practical
 move of the schoolmaster's towards a larger income
---
a good deal of coaching would be necessary, and much natural
 ability
---
It was next to impossible.


---
that, at the rate, fifteen years must elapse
---
The undertaking was hopeless.


---
me only get there
---
the rest is but a
 matter of time and energy
---
that
 the whole scheme had burst up, like an iridescent soap- bubble, under
 the touch of a reasoned inquiry
---
It had
 windows all round, from which an outlook over the whole town and
 its edifices could be gained. 
---
among the manual toilers in the shabby purlieu yet without whose denizens the hard readers
 could not read nor.


---
the high thinkers live
---
it was night. 
---
The communication was brief, and
---
though it really was from the master in person
---
It ran thus:


    BIBLIOLL COLLEGE.

   
---
that you will have a much better chance
    of success in life by remaining in your own sphere and
    sticking to your trade than by adopting any other course
---
That, therefore, is. 
---
it was true
---
Yet it seemed a hard slap after
 ten years of labour, and. 
---
That officer yawned,,,
---
what struggling
---
It had more history than the oldest
 college in the city. 
---
It was literally teeming,;

---
who had met there for tragedy, comedy, farce
---
Here the two sexes had
 met for loving, hating, coupling, parting;
---
that the town life was a book of humanity infinitely
 more palpitating, varied, and compendious than the gown life
---
though they knew little of Christ or Minster
---
That was one of the humours of things. 
---
who did know both in a way
---
The floating population
 of students and teachers,, were not
 Christminster in a local sense at all.


---
A band was playing, and
---
the crowd walked
 about and, and
---
whose head
 had just sent him the note
---
The gates were shut, and,
---
who knoweth not such things as these?_"--Job xii
---
But the laugh was not a healthy one.

---
In the evening the frequenters of the house dropped in one by one,

---
who appeared
---
There were present, too, some clerks, and a gown- and
 surplice- maker's assistant; two ladies who sported moral characters
 of various depths of shade, according to their company, nicknamed
" Bower o' Bliss" and" Freckles"; some horsey men" in the know"
 of betting circles; a travelling actor from the theatre, and two
 devil- may- care young men who proved to be gownless undergraduates
---
;
 they had slipped in by stealth,
 and.


---
The conversation waxed general. 
---
Christminster society was
 criticized,
---
how
 they ought
---
while opinions on to conduct themselves and their affairs to be properly
 respected, were exchanged in a large- minded and disinterested manner
---
what they were for so many
 years
---
is!"


---
if they'd give me a
 chance
---
they are not up to yet
---
" Hear, hear!" said the undergraduates from the corner, where they
 were talking privately about the pups.


---
" You always was fond o' books
---
" You always was fond o' books, I've heard," said Tinker Taylor," and

---
what you state
---
there was more to be learnt outside a book than in
---
" You aim at the Church, I believe?" said Uncle Joe. 
---
If you are such
 a scholar
---
Canst say the Creed in Latin, man?

---
That was."


---
how they once put it to a chap down in my country
---
" screamed one of the ladies.


---
Just you shut up, Bower o' Bliss!"
---
" said one of the undergraduates.

---
The gentleman in the corner is going

---
said the surplice- maker.


---
" You ca n't!
---
" said Uncle Joe.


---
" said Tinker Taylor.


---
" I'll swear I can!"" That's a fair offer
---
," said the undergraduate,.


---
The barmaid concocted the mixture with the bearing of a person
 compelled to live amongst animals of an inferior species, and
---
who,
 however, had not the slightest conception of a single word
---
A silence reigned among the rest in the bar, and
---
Et resurrexit tertia die, secundum Scripturas.
---
"

" That's the Nicene,"
---
" And we
 wanted the Apostles'!"


---
" You did n't say so! 
---
And every fool knows, except you,!"


---
that the
 Nicene is the most historic creed

un go on

" Let, let!" said the auctioneer.


---
get through it,"
 said Tinker Taylor.


---
Somebody threw down threepence
---
, the glass was handed,. 
---
said several,.


---
they had recognized
---
" You pack of fools!"
---
" Which one of you knows? 
---
It might have been the Ratcatcher's Daughter
 in double Dutch for all that your besotted heads can tell! 
---
who had already had
---
The landlord,, feared a riot, and
---
when it was between ten and eleven o'clock
---
for the light disappeared from
 the apartment, and
---
in a second or two the door was unlocked and
 opened, and
---
Yes, it is! 
---
My dear, dear cousin, what's the matter?"


---
Sue-- my heart is,
 and
---
as it was
---
which ought

---
" You are ill, poor dear! 
---
me see
---
one hand holding the candle and the other

---
the only spot was Marygreen.

---
while the people were at breakfast
---
whose whole life had been
 a struggle with material things
---
Refreshed by some breakfast
---
it was
---
It WAS hell--"the hell of conscious failure," both
 in ambition and in love. 
---
it was not so deep as this.

---
A mournful wind blew through the trees, and. 
---
Each ivy leaf overgrowing the wall
 of the churchless church- yard hard by,,. 
---
the new spot had already begun
---
Yet apparently it was not
 always the outdoor wind that made the deep murmurs
---
; it was a voice.

---
Presently the sounds ceased, and
---
a step seemed.

---
which was open
---
It was a young clergyman.


---
you are Mr. Highridge
---
a fellow gone
 to the bad;. 
---
though this had, up

---
that folly is with me
---
hopes one jot. 
---
The curate,, had grown deeply
 interested, and
---
If you feel a real call to the
 ministry, and
---
that you do not
---
,
 for it is
---
Only you must make up your mind."


---
It was a new idea-- the ecclesiastical and altruistic life as distinct
 from the intellectual and emulative life. 
---
which had led on to the culminating vision of the
 bishopric
---
The old fancy had not been an ethical or theological enthusiasm at all,
 but a mundane ambition masquerading in a surplice. 
---
even though it might not have
 a social unrest which had no foundation in the nobler
 instincts
---
; which was purely an artificial product of civilization
---
who ate,
---
The sensual hind drank, and.


---
that might have a touch of goodness and greatness in
 it
---
it may be said. 
---
which had extended over the greater part of a dozen years
---
who condescended

---
The human interest of the new intention-- and a human interest is
 indispensable to the most spiritual and self- sacrificing--
---
There was a theological college at Melchester
---
As it would be necessary
---
Christmas had come and, and
---
till the days had

---
; it was worse than the ecclesiastical designer's;
 worse than anywhere. 
---
This being the turning over a new leaf
---
The
 day was foggy, and
---
The lofty
 building was visible as far as the roofridge
---
; above, the dwindling
 spire rose more and more remotely,.


---
till its apex was quite lost in

---
the mist drifting across it
---
The lamps now began, and
---
that this was an
 exercise of forethought on the part of a ruling Power,
---
It was
 an ancient edifice of the fifteenth century, once a palace, now
 a training- school, with mullioned and transomed windows, and a
 courtyard in front shut in from the road by a wall. 
---
The screens and subtleties of
 convention had likewise disappeared. 
---
You said enough to let me know what had
 caused it. 
---
It was

---
they walked and. 
---
They were
 kept on very short allowances in the college, and
---
which was not much
---
The place, however, gave them a
 delightful opportunity for a_ tête- à-tête
---
_, nobody else being in the
 room, and
---
they talked freely.


---
as it was at that date
---
to whom restraint was new
---
That was. 
---
When they had sat and

---
Your hands are rather rough
---
So would yours be.
---
if they held a mallet and chisel all day
---
you know
---
it is noble
---
", what would it matter? 
---
" You are wriggling out!"


---
if it, Sue, and it is n't quite kind
---
this reproof was deciding
---
you'll be angry
---
that's!"


---
" This is:
---
that we shall then take a large double school in a great
 town
---
have got my certificate; do, and."


---
But of course it is right
---
-- you could n't have done
 better!"


---
you would be angry
---
you come
---
We had better not meet again; and
---
we'll only
 correspond at long intervals, on purely business matters!"


---
it brought him round at once. 
---
, we will
---
" Your being engaged can make no difference to me
 whatever. 
---
us talk of it any more
---
It is
---
What does it matter about what one is going to do
 two years hence!"


---
" Shall we go and?"
---
when their
 meal was finished
---
" That's the centre of the town life now. 
---
The cathedral has had its
 day!"


---
" How modern you are!"


---
" So would you be! 
---
if you had lived so much in the Middle Ages
---
The cathedral was a very good place
 four or five centuries ago; but
---
it is played out now... 
---
if you only
 knew
---
" Only you do n't
 know, from your point of view, or
---
you would n't think so
 much of me, or. 
---
Now there's just
 time for us to walk round the Close
---
they parted. 
---
it did anything but.

---
there being, as a rule, less
 stone- cutting in progress in this quiet city, and hands being mostly
 permanent
---
which
 were very extensive
---
the whole interior stonework having been
 overhauled, to be largely replaced by new
---
It might be a labour of
 years, and
---
it all done
---
mechanics of any sort usually care. 
---
the parlour downstairs bore a clock on the mantelpiece
.

II


" To- morrow is our grand day,. 
---
you know
---
Where shall we go?"


---
Wherever we can get to and. 
---
And then we can do Fonthill
---
if we like--
---
" Wardour is-- and
---
Gothic ruins
---
It is a classic building-- Corinthian, I
 think; with a lot of pictures.
---
" Ah-- that will do. 
---
We'll go."


---
Their conversation had run thus some few weeks later, and
---
next
 morning they prepared. 
---
that was rather enforced

---
" the screaming of the trains-- everything formed the
 basis of a beautiful crystallization. 
---
A matter
 of ten pounds spent in a drapery- shop,, would have set all Melchester
. 
---
The guard of the train thought.


---
they were lovers, and
---
That's a good intention wasted!
---
They reached the park and castle and. 
---
, it grew reverent and abstracted.

---
It was evident.


---
When they came out a long time
---
as they had had something to eat
---
that as soon they should
 walk across the high country to the north of their present position,
 and
---
away they went,.


---
It was indeed open country, wide and high. 
---
They talked and. 
---
About half- way on their journey they crossed a main
 road running due east and west-- the old road from London to Land's
 End. 
---
They paused, and.


---
which had come over this once lively
 thoroughfare
---
while the wind dipped to earth and
---
They crossed the road and, but
---
They had walked a good distance altogether, and
---
if they could not
 reach the other station
---
it would be rather awkward. 
---
For a long
 time there was no cottage visible on the wide expanse of down and
 turnip- land; but
---
presently they came to a sheepfold, and next to the
 shepherd, pitching hurdles. 
---
from which a
 faint blue smoke arose, and
---
This they did, and.


---
the thatch is
---
that' twill soon be cheaper to cover your house wi'
 chainey plates than thatch
---
They sat, and
---
the shepherd came in. 
---
But mid you be thinking? 
---
o' getting back to Melchester to- night
 by train
---
Because you'll never do it in this world,. 
---
since you do n't
 know the lie of the country
---
even then the train mid be gone."


---
They started up.


---
You can bide here over the night--
---
, you know,
---
The place is welcome to ye. 
---
' Tis hard lying, rather, but
---
volk may do
 worse." 
---
Be you a married
 couple
---
after
 they've gone through
---
" Oh-- I meant nothing ba'dy-- not I!  I can call ye soon enough to catch the first
 train back.  You've lost this one now."


---
On consideration they decided, and.


---
while their entertainers were
 clearing away the dishes
---
" You only think
---
you like it
---
you do n't
---
;: you are quite a product of
 civilization
---
" Do you remember it so well? 
---
You seem to me.
---
You do n't know.
---
what's inside me
---
what you are
---
The shepherd aroused them the next morning,. 
---
It was
 bright and clear, and
---
the four miles to the train were accomplished
 pleasantly. 
---
When they had reached Melchester, and
---
the gables of the old building be immured
---
They rang the great bell and.


---
" It is a new little photograph
 of me. 
---
Would you like it?
---
the porter came. 
---
There seemed to
. 
---
though several were older
---
who at this date filled
 the species of nunnery known as the Training- School at Melchester
---
They sat in the large school- room
 of the establishment on the evening previously described, and word
.


---
" That excuse has been made a little too often in this school
---
The fact was. 
---
The affair had
 created a scandal, and
---
the management had consequently been rough on
 cousins ever since.


---
At nine o'clock the names were called
---
At a quarter past nine the seventy stood up," and. 
---
After prayers they went in to
 supper, and
---
Some
 of the students,, felt. 
---
that they
 would not mind
---
Hardly one among them
 believed in the cousinship.


---
Half an hour later they all lay in their cubicles
---
which at intervals
 stretched down the long dormitories
---
wherein they were
,
---
which by no possible exertion of their willing hearts and
 abilities could be made strong
---
while the inexorable laws of nature
 remain
---
what they are
---
They formed a pretty, suggestive, pathetic
 sight, of whose pathos and beauty they were themselves unconscious,
 and would not discover till, amid the storms and strains of
 after- years, with their injustice, loneliness, child- bearing, and
 bereavement
---
, their minds would revert to this experience as to
 something which had been allowed to slip past them insufficiently
 regarded.


---
One of the mistresses came in. 
---
which, like all the rest,
 was ornamented with various girlish trifles
---
photographs being
 not the least conspicuous among them
---
" Strictly
 speaking, relations' portraits only are allowed on these tables,"


---
you
 know.
---
" You are sure' twas not the undergraduate?"


---
The lights were promptly extinguished, and
---
When they awoke the next morning
---
when they had come up
---
After the early lessons by
 gas- light, in half- toilet, and to dress for
 breakfast, the bell of the entrance gate was heard.

---
The mistress of the dormitory went away, and.


---
that the principal's orders were
---
that nobody was
---
none of them coming out
---
When they had gone downstairs
---
they found and
---
they then learnt.


---
this the seventy murmured
---
At, the sentence being too
 severe. 
---
, they thought,
---
No notice was taken.

---
when the geography mistress began
---
You mean
---
that you are not going
---
" to work?" said the mistress at last.

---
that it has been ascertained
---
We have written to
 Christminster.
---
However, they remained stolid and motionless, and
---
as they sat
---
one rushed
 in. 
---
nobody could tell,
---
as it was bounded by the river at the bottom, and

---
the side door was locked
---
They went and. 
---
the casement between the
 middle mullions of which stood open
---
The lawn was again searched
 with a lantern, every bush and shrub being examined, but
---
Then the porter of the front gate was interrogated,
 and
---
some ducks had come down the river from above
---
said a mistress.


---
The mind of the matron was
---
which, added to the scandal of the year before,

---
More lanterns were procured, and
---
the river examined; and
---
which was open to the fields
---
,
 the matron began.


---
what many
 of the thoughtless inmates despised
---
Certainly somebody had thrown gravel. 
---
" Yes-- it is! 
---
, the front
 door being opened merely by a knob which anybody could turn, as
 in most old country towns. 
---
What
 counterparts they were! 
---
" Whatever have you done,?
---
" Walked through the largest river in the county-- that's! 
---
They locked me up for being out with you; and
---
it seemed so
 unjust that I could n't bear it,!" 
---
" You must take off all your things! 
---
me
 see
---
-- you must borrow some from the landlady.
---
We are so near the
 school!"


---
that they'll come after me
---
" Then you must put on mine. 
---
You do n't mind?"


---
" My Sunday suit, you know. 
---
It is close here." 
---
because there was not
 room for it to be otherwise
---
A clock struck half- past seven, and
---
Jude, it is odd? 
---
that you should see me like this and all
 my things hanging there
---
Will you dry my clothes now? 
---
It is not late yet."


---
" No, you sha n't,. 
---
if you are ill
---
You must stay here. 
---
" Here's six of best brandy
---
" Now you drink it,

---
since
 they had parted
---
Somebody knocked and

---
It was the landlady.


---
whether you was in or not, Mr. Fawley
---
if you would require supper
---
you've a young
 gentleman--"

" Yes, ma'am
---
Will you bring
 supper up on a tray, and
---
they were far from dry. 
---
A thick woollen
 gown held a deal of water. 
---
as the steam from the garments went up
 the chimney
---
How do you feel now?"


---
What time is
 it? 
---
" It is past ten."


---
" Is it really? 
---
where you are
---
" Yes; that's. 
---
what they would
 say
---
And what will you do?
---
To- morrow
 is Sunday, and
---
Perhaps you will be

---
The tea must have been green, or too long drawn,,;.


---
who had not taken

---
" You called me a creature of civilization, or something,"

---
did n't you?
---
" It was very odd."


---
you should have done
 that
---
" Well, because it is provokingly wrong. 
---
" You are very philosophical. '
---
A negation' is
---
" Is it? 
---
" You have read more than I
---
" How came you to
?"


---
it was by accident
---
My life has been
 entirely shaped by what people call a peculiarity in me. 
---
if you never say it, or
---
However, what to say is."


---
" Is your friendship broken off?"


---
We used. 
---
my saying
---
We shared a sitting- room for fifteen months; and
---
That's!"


---
" Good heavens!--what did you do then?"


---
" Ah-- now you are angry with me!"
---
you did n't know
---
However you have lived
---
you are
 as innocent as you are unconventional
---
as you see
---
if that's
---
what you mean
---
as they
 began
---
People say cold- natured-- sexless-- on account of it. 
---
Some of the most passionately erotic poets have been.
---
" Are n't you REALLY vexed with me, dear Jude?"
---
that it hardly seemed to

---
" You do n't care MORE! 
---
There was another long silence. 
---
you
 know. 
---
And what do you think? 
---
if you
 were n't here
---
you
 would n't like--"

"
---
if you do n't mind
---
you would n't join
---
You must
 remember."


---
you said
---
" Then you have n't given up the idea?--
---
that perhaps you had
 by this time
---
that you felt,
---
as you were so mixed up in Christminster Anglicanism
---
" My
 friend took that out of me. 
---
And intellect at Christminster
 is new wine in old bottles. 
---
The mediæ valism of Christminster must
 go,
---
Christminster itself will have. 
---
To
 be sure, at times one could n't help,; but
---
as preserved by a section of the
 thinkers there in touching and simple sincerity
---
I spoke of when I was in my
 saddest, rightest mind I always felt,


   ' O ghastly glories of saints, dead limbs of gibbeted Gods!'"...


" Sue, you are not a good friend of mine!"


---
The emotional throat- note had come back,
 and
---
Christminster has much that is glorious
---
" THEY see life, of course; but
---
as it is
---
few of the people
 in the colleges do. 
---
You prove it in your own person. 
---
Christminster was intended for when the colleges
 were founded;
---
But you were elbowed off the pavement
 by the millionaires' sons."


---
" At present
 intellect in Christminster is pushing one way, and religion the
 other; and
---
so they stand stock- still,."


---
like two rams butting each
 other
---
" Well, that's, too
---
" But you are good and dear!"
---
You are in the Tractarian stage just now
---
", are you not?
---
me see--
---
In the year eighteen hundred and--"

" There's a sarcasm in that.

---
which is rather unpleasant to me, Sue
---
Now will you do? 
---
Now will you concentrate your
 attention on any book of these you, and? 
---
You are sure you wo n't join me?"


---
" No. Do n't tease, Sue!"

" Very well-- I'll do, and. 
---
just as you bid me
---
me make you a NEW New Testament, like the one I made
 for myself at Christminster
---
How was that made?
---
it was an excellent idea
---
that reading it
 afterwards made it twice as interesting as before, and twice as
 understandable
---
" And what a literary enormity this is,". 
---
You need n't be
---
alarmed: nobody claims inspiration for the chapter
 headings. 
---
Indeed, many divines treat them with contempt. 
---
It seems
 the drollest thing to think of the four- and- twenty elders, or
 bishops, or whatever number they were, sitting with long faces and
 writing down such stuff."


---
" You are quite Voltairean!"
---
nobody is ever
 on my side!"


---
" Yes you are,
---
yes you are!"
---
You are on the side of the people
 in the training- school
---
"-- at least you seem! 
---
is,?'
---
Whither is thy

---
it be
---
You make such a personal matter of
 everything! 
---
You know
---
" But you are not!" 
---
Then their eyes met, and
---
they
 shook hands like cronies in a tavern, and
---
you wanted
---
But you take so much tradition on trust that
 I do n't know what to say.
---
one must take some things on trust
---
Life
 is n't long enough to work out everything in Euclid problems before

---
you believe it. 
---
" Well, perhaps you might take something worse."


---
because we are going
---
to be VERY nice with each
 other, are n't we, and?" 
---
Was it... 
---
that which had broken the heart of the poor
 leader- writer; and
---
They sat on, and
---
" The
 town is not yet astir."


---
" But you have had no breakfast."


---
Things seem so different in the cold light of morning
---
, do n't
 they? 
---
" Oh no, you sha n't.
---
who has asked me
---
till this has blown over
---
" Now a dew- bit to eat with it and off we go. 
---
You can
 have a regular breakfast."


---
when you get there
---
They went quietly out of the house,
---
As they departed along the street
---
They stood rather miserably
 together on the platform; and
---
it was apparent.


---
as the
 train came up
---
" One is a warm one, the other a cold one!"


---
And you must n't!"


---
" You must n't love me. 
---
You are
---
to like me-- that's all!"


---
And then the train moved on, and.




---
You had been so very good and kind to
   
---
when you were out of sight
---
it has reproached me
    ever since. 
---
IF YOU WANT
---
that you must n't
---
It would be superfluous; and
---
which should have

---
the distance being under eighteen
 miles
---
none came. 
---
The third morning arrived
---
; the postman did
 not stop. 
---
This was Saturday, and
---
that somebody would have

---
most of the inhabitants having gathered
 inside the church, whence their voices could occasionally be heard in
 unison
---
" How is this! 
---
You could n't write?
---
" No-- it was n't that!"
---
" Yes-- that was! 
---
They wo n't have me back at the school
---
-- that's. 
---
" They not only wo n't have me, but
---
they gave me a parting piece of
 advice--"

" What?"


---
-- it is so vulgar and distressing!"


---
" Is it about us?"


---
" Well-- somebody has sent them baseless reports about us, and
---
they
 say you
---
that means
---
It did just OCCUR to me to

---
they think
---
that the cousinship was merely nominal,
---
since we met as
 total strangers
---
you thought of such a thing as marrying
 me till the other evening
---
; to fancy you did love me a
 little. 
---
It
 is all my fault. 
---
Everything is my fault always!"


---
The speech seemed a little forced and unreal, and
---
they regarded each
 other with a mutual distress.


---
what you felt
 at all
---
Oh, you have been unkind to me--! 
---
you have--
---
Your attitude to me has become; and
---
naturally they
 think! 
---
we've been doing wrong
---
that our meeting as
 strangers prevented a sense of relationship, and
---
that it was a sort
 of subterfuge
---
But do n't you think?"


---
" You ought not, and
---
you are right. 
---
You belong to--
---
You are glad, of course,!

---
This will blow over, dear Sue
---
" The training- school
 authorities are not all the world. 
---
You can get no doubt.
---
there was no more
 intimate conversation. 
---
as that would have
---
it was necessary and proper
---
It was so dear of you! 
---
if you would like
---
sixty miles to the
 south- west as the crow flies.


---
A glance at the place and its accessories was almost enough to reveal
 that the schoolmaster's plans and dreams so long indulged in had
 been abandoned for some new dream with which neither the Church nor
 literature had much in common. 
---
All the furniture being fixed
---
, the books shelved, and the nails
 driven
---
But it was not the real, or the whole, reason, after all.

---
And yet the tale, true
 enough till latterly, was not true now. 
---
was
 not history. 
---
Each was in its
 envelope, and
---
just as it had arrived
---
the handwriting was of the same
 womanly character as the historic notes. 
---
At first sight there seemed in these
 small documents. 
---
They were
 straightforward, frank letters, signed" Sue B--";
---
just such ones as
 would be written during short absences, with no other thought than
 their speedy destruction, and chiefly concerning books in reading
 and other experiences of a training school. 
---
, forgotten doubtless by
 the writer with the passing of the day of their inditing
---
which it
 would infallibly be)
---
Over these phrases the
 school- master pored. 
---
What precise shade of satisfaction was? 
---
The schoolmaster's was an unhealthy- looking, old- fashioned face,
. 
---
A certain
 gentlemanliness had been imparted to it by nature,. 
---
lest they should read
---
as it might almost have been considered
---
although it was fourteen days old
---
that
 this proved nothing,
---
a natural delicacy being as ample a reason for
 silence as any degree of blameworthiness
---
it was dangerous
---
It was merely. 
---
that
 you have seen my little friend Sue recently
---
It occurred to me to
. 
---
was,". 
---
You know?--
---
what they say
---
I am glad of your kindness in coming to talk plainly to
 me about it I ought." And I wish with all my soul I could!"

" I had no idea that it was of
 this nature!  God forbid!"


---
you understood
---
was simply.


---
since this painful matter has been opened up
---
" But---- what really
 happened?".

---
who felt
---
that
 a sharp smart now was better than a long agony of suspense hereafter
---
" Cases arise, and
---
this is one, when even ungenerous questions must be
."


---
that the suspicion is an absolutely baseless one
---
It is
---
The schoolmaster rose. 
---
Each of the twain felt.


---
that the interview
 could not comfortably merge in a friendly discussion of their recent
 experiences, after the manner of friends; and
---
which the old
 cathedral was undergoing
---
This visit took place about eleven o'clock in the morning; but
---
though it was
 not one
---
if you ask anything more
---
" It is very odd that--"
---
" That you are often not so nice in your real presence as you are in
 your letters!"


---
" Does it really seem so to you?. 
---
" Well, that's strange; but
---
When you are gone away
---
that they were getting
 upon dangerous ground
---
It was now.


---
It was that
---
which made
---
me
 write and
---
if you wanted to, much
---
The exultation seemed to
 imply,, and
---
Yes you have
---
" And you had better not come to my lodgings. 
---
us go in
 here
---
by which they stood
---
The building was the market- house
---
; it was the
 only place available; and
---
they entered,
---
the market being over, and
 the stalls and areas empty. 
---
while they walked up and down over a
 floor littered with rotten cabbage- leaves,
---
It seemed so cruel."


---
So it was better!"


---
Their old relations of confidence seemed

---
the antagonisms of sex to sex were left
 without any counter- poising predilections. 
---
if you had taken it differently
---
that you might love me, or something of the
 sort!--just out of charity-- and all the time-- oh, it is perfectly
 damnable how things are!"
---
" You take me wrong, Sue! 
---
you cared for me at all
---
it did not matter
---
Do you care for me,

---
?-- you know?--
---
" You are not the least alike. 
---
-- they always do!"


---
How will the demi- gods in your Pantheon intercede for you after this?

---
Now it would have been different, and not
 remarkable, for I at least do n't regard marriage as a sacrament.

---
Your theories are not so advanced as your practice!"


---
-- I mean those
 legendary persons you call saints-- if I had done such a thing" Sue, you are terribly cutting! 
---
you like
---
But you must treat me!"


---
as you will
---
Ah-- you should have told me
---
before you gave
 me that idea that you wanted to be allowed to love me
---
They were quite screened from the market- square without, and
---
It would be
 hypocrisy; and
---
that it would be meant as from my cousin
---
I am-- because I meant to it
 ca n't be in any other way."


---
They moved on a dozen paces, and
---
that were necessary
---
But, after all, it does n't matter. 
---
We should
 have had."


---
, you see,
---
even if this had not been in your
 life
---
No, we should n't
---
This is the only obstacle.
---
" You forget
---
even if there had been no obstacle
---
" And then we are cousins,
 and
---
it is bad. 
---
for cousins to marry
---
our going on together
---
as we were going
---
, in a sort of
 friendly way, the people round us
---
As to would have made it unable to

---
as is proved by their expelling me from the school
---
Their philosophy
 only recognizes relations based on animal desire. 
---
where desire plays, at least, only a secondary
 part, is ignored by them
---
who is it
---
showed; and
---
before they parted
---
" There were several reasons against
 my telling you rashly. 
---
One was
---
; another, that
 it was always impressed upon me that I ought not to marry-- that
 I belonged to an odd and peculiar family-- the wrong breed for
 marriage."


---
what I have said" Ah-- who used?"


---
it always ended badly with us Fawleys
---
" That's strange. 
---
They stood possessed by the same thought, ugly enough, even as an
 assumption: that a union between them, had such been possible
---
" Oh, but there ca n't be anything in it!"
---
" Our family have been unlucky of late years in choosing
 mates
---
-- that's all."


---
And then they pretended. 
---
that had

---
that all happened, and
---
that they could still be cousins
 and friends and warm correspondents, and
---
when they met
---
even if they met less frequently than before
---
Their
 parting was in good friendship, and
---
We had intended,,. 
---
as you
    know
---
because the awkwardness of my
    situation has really come about by my fault in getting
    expelled
---
you are to
---
you must n't
    refuse!--Your affectionate cousin,

    SUSANNA FLORENCE MARY BRIDEHEAD.



---
Everything seemed. 
---
You do n't know

---
Could it be possible? 
---
To be sure, there seemed to
; but
---
that the best course to prove how unfounded were the
 suspicions of the school authorities would be
---
:


    Jude, will you give me away? 
---
you wo n't think
    it a trouble
---
it seems to me very humiliating that a
    giver- away should be required at all. 
---
as there printed
---
is. 
---
as you have
    no house of your own
---
that,, you do not marry from your school
    friend's, but from mine
---
It would be more proper.

   
---
as you say
---
why you sign your letter in such a new and
    terribly formal way
---
Surely you care a bit about me
    still!--Ever your affectionate
---
was a little

---
What an
 idiot it made! 
---
for the schoolmaster sent him a line of warm thanks,

---
which would allow of a ten days' stay in the city
 prior to the ceremony, sufficiently representing a nominal residence
 of fifteen
---
on a different floor, and
 they saw each other little,. 
---
; their conversation was
 mechanical,. 
---
What's the matter
---
which seemed
---
you know
---
That's."


---
they
 had not put such confidence in their new view of things
---
" You have quite made up your mind
---
After breakfast they went out on an errand together. 
---
moved by a mutual
 thought that it was the last opportunity they would have of indulging
 in unceremonious companionship
---
as they walked through the muddy street
---
on turning the
 corner they found themselves close to a grey perpendicular church
 with a low- pitched roof-- the church of St. Thomas.


---
" That's the church
---
what the spot is like where I am so soon to kneel and do it
---
what marriage means
---
they entered by
 the western door. 
---
The only person inside the gloomy building was
 a charwoman cleaning. 
---
you do
---
" They are interesting,. 
---
because they have probably never been done
 before
---
No doubt you will!
---
""

" Was it like this?"


---
when you were
---
" Good God, Sue-- don't be so awfully merciless!... 
---
There, dear one,
 I did n't mean it!"


---
My curiosity to hunt up a new sensation
 always leads me into these scrapes. 
---
You will, wo n't
 you,
---
" Now we'll hurry away, and
---
they came out of the building,. 
---
they
 encountered on entering the main street
---
" We have been doing such a funny thing!"
---
" We've been to the church,. 
---
as it were
---
Have n't we
---
how they had marched up to the altar
---
Will you both
 come to the shop with me?"


---
shortly after they prepared
 for the ceremony. 
---
than it had been for
 the previous twenty years
---
when they came out
---
The schoolmaster and Sue were unknown,
---
the couple were
 judged,
---
nobody supposing

---
which turned out, as a veil
---
" It looks so odd over a bonnet
---
it stay
---
When they had passed up the church and
---
that the antecedent visit had certainly taken off the edge
 of this performance, but
---
Was it? 
---
that they
 were, instead of more sensitive,; or
---
were they more heroic
---
as it seemed
---
they had

---
As soon as signed their names and come away, and the suspense was over
---
at two o'clock
 they went off. 
---
Could it be
---
" It is my handkerchief. 
---
whether it were
---
when they were gone
---
The feeling grew and

---
" Has anybody been
 for me?"
---
Nobody had been there.


---
even when the clock had
 struck eleven, and
---
the family had retired
---
Her
 actions were always unpredictable
---
as watchers sit on Old- Midsummer eves
---
through which the moon showed its
 position rather than its shape, and
---
one or two of the larger stars
 made themselves visible as faint nebulæ only
---
Every desired renewal of an existence is debased by being half alloy.

---
; the sunshine was as drab
 paint, and the blue sky as zinc. 
---
what
 worth there might be in the builder's offer
---
The city of learning wore an estranged look, and
---
as the sun made vivid lights
 and shades of the mullioned architecture of the façades, and
---
the place look more
 beautiful
---
It was, and
---
Hers was
 now the city phantom,.


---
while those of the intellectual and devotional
 worthies were no longer able to
 assert their presence there
---
who opened the door
---
that the builder had called
---
caused by these scenes
---
which had been
---
who
 proposed.

---
that they should adjourn to a bar and
---
till they stood before one of the
 great palpitating centres of Christminster life
---
it was too

---
The bar had been gutted and newly arranged throughout
---
,
 mahogany fixtures having taken the place of the old painted
 ones,. 
---
while at the back of the standing- space there were stuffed
 sofa- benches
---
The room was divided into compartments in the approved
 manner, between which were screens of ground glass in mahogany
 framing,. 
---
being put to the blush
 by the recognitions of those in the next
---
till the train left
---
glass shelves running along their front,

---
The moment
 was enlivened by the entrance of some customers into the next
 compartment, and
---
the starting of the mechanical tell- tale of monies
 received,.


---
which emitted every time a coin was put in
---
whose blue flame sent a steam from the top
---
How can you tell such a tale to me in my
 innocence!
---
what do you use
---
" Do n't you ask questions, and
---
you wo n't hear lies.
---
which you've been keeping from me for
 the last quarter of an hour
---
There was a slight struggle and titter, and

---
It was
 extraordinary
---
this being
 the case
---
Then their glances met.

---
you were underground years ago
---
that the house will
 afford, for old acquaintance' sake
---
The fact was.


---
" That's a pity
---
, now you could get it for nothing."


---
" But I do n't want
 anything more than I've had." " How long have you been here?"


---
you know.
---
you came to this place
---
you were gone to glory, and
---
Nobody was likely to
 know me here,,."


---
I returned from Sydney three months ago.  I always
 liked this business,"

" I wonder!"

" Well, as I say, I thought being in
 London I saw the situation in an advertisement.  even if I had minded for I was never in Christminster
 in my growing up" Why did you return from Australia?"


---
Then you are not a don yet?
---
" Oh, I had my reasons... " I am as I was."

" True-- you look so." 
---
which pulled the engine
---
it might be awkward
---
It was for other reasons."


---
" I did n't mean on that account-- for as I said I did n't expect you.
" What were they?"


---
We ca n't talk here
---
" Ca n't you wait till nine? 
---
as you say
---
, we ca n't talk here.

---
However, there was only one thing now,
 and
---
that was,
---
the law being the law,
 and
---
the conjuncture could not be helped.

---
The inn was now brilliantly
, and
---
the scene was altogether more brisk and gay. 
---
The
 faces of the barmaidens had risen in colour,
---
; their manners were still more vivacious than
.


---
before-- more abandoned, more excited, more sensuous, and they
 expressed their sentiments and desires less euphemistically, laughing
 in a lackadaisical tone, without reserve
---
the customers were fewer at last. 
---
" But you must have something with me first
---
Then you can
 go out and." 
---
as it is best
---
we should not be seen
---
What arrangement do you want
?"


---
if you'd like to
---
Of course,, you can
---
" Well, that we'll consider... 
---
until we have come to some
 agreement
---
Now, it is awkward. 
---
our being together here--
---
where you are known,
 and though without any suspicion that I have
 anything to do with you
---
As we are going towards the station
---
we take the nine- forty train to Aldbrickham
---
We shall be
 there in little more than half an hour, and
---
nobody will know us for
 one night, and
---
we shall be quite free to act as we choose."


---
till we
 have made up our minds
---
whether we'll make anything public or not
---
As you like
---
This is my lodging.

---
Sometimes, so
 nobody will think anything of my staying out."


---
they went on to the railway, and.




---
where they entered a third- rate
 inn near the station in time for a late supper
---
IX


 On the morrow between nine and half- past they were journeying back
 to Christminster, the only two occupants of a compartment in a
 third- class railway- carriage. 
---
They walked in silence a little way out of
 the town in the direction of Alfredston. 
---
" This is the very road by which I came into Christminster years ago
 full of plans!"


---
whatever the road is
---
my time is nearly up,
---
So perhaps we had better
 part here. 
---
since we've

---
But you said?
---
when we were getting up this morning
---
that
 you had something you wished to tell me before I left
---
But you would n't promise
. 
---
if you promise
---
you to know it
---
who managed the Sydney hotel
---
what I began" You'll keep it close?"


---
It was stupid,
; but
---
" Why the devil did n't you tell me last, night!"
---
Wo n't you make it up with me, then?
---
-- you've confessed to!"


---
They do n't think much of such as that over there!

---
Lots of'em do it... 
---
if you take it like
---
we lived honourable enough, and
 as respectable as any married couple in the colony! 
---
where you were
---
perhaps it
 would be misplaced. 
---
What do you wish?
---
me to do
---
There was one thing more I wanted to tell you; but I fancy
 we've seen enough of one another for the present! 
---
what you said about your circumstances
---
you know
---
Thus they parted. 
---
They looked away from each other,. 
---
as you asked me to
---
there was
 nobody to meet me! 
---
they told me
. 
---
as you did not come
 all night
---
that perhaps, when
 you found yourself back in the old city
---
, you were upset at-- at
 thinking I was-- married, and not there as I used to be; and
---
that you
 had
---
nobody to speak to
---
; so you had tried. 
---
as you
 did at that former time when you were disappointed about entering as
 a student, and
---
that you never would
 again
---
why you had n't come
---
" And you came, and!"


---
," you did n't come back last
 night and,!"


---
as you engaged to
---
" You'll go back with me?
---
" There's a train just now. 
---
And so, Sue, you really came
 on my account all this way! 
---
At what an early time you must have
 poor thing!"


---
Sitting up watching alone made me all nerves for you, and
 instead of going to bed when it got light I started. 
---
And now you
 wo n't frighten me like this again about your morals for nothing?
---
till they had entered the train
---
some troublous discussion would be initiated
---
you are now
---
" Sue-- married, you know, like me; and
---
yet we have been in
 such a hurry that we have not said a word about it!"


---
There's no necessity
---
don't talk about ME
---
you would n't
---
" It distresses me, rather. 
---
my saying it!... 
---
Where did you
 stay last night?
---
Their talk proceeded but
---
awkwardly till they reached Alfredston.

---
There remained the five- mile extra journey into the country, which
 it was just as easy to walk as to drive, the greater part of it being
 uphill. 
---
It was now.


---
which temporarily banished the shady associations of the
 earlier time
---
it would be better
---
Since it turns out
---
" You ought."


---
It is not so many weeks
, and--
---
" Well, you have my good wishes now as always, Mrs. Phillotson."


---
", only you do n't know it! 
---
Wifedom has not yet
 squashed up and."


---
which has no
 further individuality
---
" But it has!"
---
When they reached the lone cottage under the firs
---
A squalid family lived there
 now. 
---
That's the house
---
what the school- house at Shaston
 is to me
---
as you are in yours
---
they walked some way
. 
---
one never knows
---
which elderly husbands do n't do in general
---
If
 you think
---
, you are wrong.
---
" And you wo n't say things to distress me,
---
will you?"


---
They plunged into the concave field on the other side of which. 
---
they found
---
Mrs. Edlin standing at the door,
---
if you'll believe me
---
What will come
---
They must have looked their amazement,
---
" Ah-- sceered ye, have I! 
---
' Tis more than flesh and blood can bear,!... 
---
that by a feller that do n't know half as well

---
as you do yourself
---
" All our family do-- and nearly all
 everybody else's. 
---
You should have done
---
What made"


---
What makes
---
You mean
---
" Do ye love un?"


---
but
 Lord!--I do n't want, but
---
I should
 have said.  I do n't say so NOW, since you must ha' known
 better than I--
---
but that's!"


---
you know
---
" Oh no-- it is n't that!"
---
" What is it, then?"


---
" It is--
---
that is
---
They went back, and
---
the subject was smoothed over, and
---
if you'd like
---
No, dear-- you are not
---
you are in a good mood
---
that treated of the Ascetics of the second century
---
The letter bore a London postmark instead of the
 Christminster one. 
---
the house being situated in an excellent,
 densely populated, gin- drinking neighbourhood, and
---
which could be easily doubled
---
as they had only parted in a slight tiff,
 and
---
that this nearness was a
 distinct reason for not going southward at all
---
Christminster
 was too sad a place to bear,.

---
while the proximity of Shaston to
 Melchester might afford him the glory of worsting the Enemy in a
 close engagement, such as was deliberately sought by the priests and
 virgins of the early Church, who, disdaining an ignominious flight
 from temptation, became even chamber- partners with impunity
---
that, taken all round
---
; the utmost for was that.


---
in a life of constant internal warfare between flesh and
 spirit the former might not always be victorious
---
the ultimate result
 was.


---
One evening about Easter the choir met for practice, and
---
a new
 hymn was. 
---
It turned out. 
---
As they all sang it over and over

---
When they had finished
---
The score was in manuscript,."


---
the name of the composer
 being at the head, together with the title of the hymn:" The Foot
 of the Cross
---
" Yes," said the organist. 
---
which accounts for the quality of the piece
---
when the post was vacant
---
I think.  The hymn is getting about everywhere this
 Easter."


---
If there were any person in the world to choose as a
 confidant
---
, this composer would be the one,.


---
it was
---
Also that the gentleman himself had just passed along the street not
 five minutes before.


---
if this were an expedient
 time to call
---
" And we have this week practised' The Foot
 of the Cross,',?
---
that you composed
---
" Ah well-- other people have said so too. 
---
Yes, there's money in
 it,. 
---
These
 publishing people-- they want. 
---
the copyright of an obscure composer's
 work, such as mine is, for almost less than I should have to pay a
 person for making a fair manuscript copy of the score
---
you
 speak of I
---
The one have lent to various friends about here and Melchester,
 and
---
so it has got. 
---
But music is a poor staff to

---
You must go into trade. 
---
if you
 want
---
The wine business is. 
---
This is my forthcoming list
---
-- it is not issued yet-- but
---
if I could only see about getting it published I have other
 compositions to go with it, too; I wish I could bring them out; for
 I have n't made a five- pound note out of any of them yet.  lean on-- I am giving it up entirely.  what I am thinking
 of you can
 take one."


---
They talked a little longer, but
---
when the musician
 found
---
which had

---
But a
 growing impatience of faith,, made. 
---
what had
 happened
---
as Drayton sang it
---
The spot was the
 burial- place of a king and a queen, of abbots and abbesses, saints
 and bishops, knights and squires. 
---
The bones of King Edward" the
 Martyr," carefully removed hither for holy preservation, brought
 Shaston a renown which made it the resort of pilgrims from every part
 of Europe, and. 
---
To this fair creation of the great Middle- Age
 the Dissolution was,
---
as historians tell us
---
With
 the destruction of the enormous abbey the whole place collapsed in a
 general ruin
---
: the Martyr's bones met with the fate of the sacred pile
 that held them, and not a stone is now left to tell where they lie.


---
The natural picturesqueness and singularity of the town still remain;
 but strange to say these qualities, which were noted by many writers
 in ages when scenic beauty is said to have been unappreciated
---
one of the queerest and quaintest spots in
 England stands virtually unvisited to- day.


---
It has a unique position on the summit of a steep and imposing scarp,
. 
---
west sides of the borough out of
 the deep alluvial Vale of Blackmoor, the view from the Castle Green
 over three counties of verdant pasture-- South, Mid, and Nether
 Wessex-- being as sudden a surprise to the unexpectant traveller's
 eyes
---
Impossible to a railway,
 it can best be reached on foot, next best by light vehicles; and

---
it is hardly accessible to these but by a sort of isthmus on the
 north- east,.


---
that connects it with the high chalk table- land on that
 side
---
Such is, and
---
Its situation rendered water the great want of the town; and
---
that in former times the town passed
 through a curious period of corruption, conventual and domestic,
---
that Shaston was remarkable for three consolations
 to man, such as the world afforded not elsewhere
---
It was a place
 where the churchyard lay nearer heaven than the church steeple, where
 beer was more plentiful than water, and where there were more wanton
 women than honest wives and maids. 
---
It is also said. 
---
that after the
 Middle Ages the inhabitants were too poor to pay their priests,
 and
---
which they
 bemoaned over their cups in the settles of their inns on Sunday
 afternoons
---
In those days the Shastonians were apparently not
 without a sense of humour.


---
There was another peculiarity-- this a modern one-- which Shaston
 appeared to owe to its site. 
---
It was the resting- place and
 headquarters of the proprietors of wandering vans, shows,
 shooting- galleries, and other itinerant concerns, whose business
 lay largely at fairs and markets. 
---
As strange wild birds are seen

---
they followed thither
---
as if surprised by a change in the
 landscape so violent as to hinder their further progress
---
here
 they usually remained all the winter.


---
till they turned
---
The hour was too early
---
; the pupils were still in
 school,; and
---
which were extensive and stone- built
---
as such trees will only
 grow on chalk uplands
---
till the children were dismissed
---
till young voices could be heard in the open air, and
---
which the abbess, prioress, subprioress, and fifty nuns had
---
who was

---
till the person came close and
---
They used.
---
It is odd
---
" Oh, but you ARE one of that sort,!"


---
for you are just like me at
 heart
---
by an unpremeditated
 instinct each clasped the other's hand again.


---
what we both did that for
---
because we are both alike,
---
as I said before" And they rule thoughts... 
---
Is n't it enough!"


---
" I went."

" Oh, you goose--! 
---
just what I should have done Why did you?"


---
Because we are not alike
---
" Now we'll have some tea
---
" Shall we have it here instead
 of in my house? 
---
It is no trouble. 
---
We do n't live at the school, but in that
 ancient dwelling across the way called Old- Grove Place. 
---
you know
---
It is so
 antique and dismal that it depresses me dreadfully. 
---
Such houses are
 very well but
---
there spent
---
In a new place
 like these schools there is only your own life to support. 
---
, they sat down by the same light,.


---
assisted by the blue rays of a
 spirit- lamp under the brass kettle on the stand
---
This is one of your wedding- presents to me
---
Do you know of any good
 readable edition of the uncanonical books of the New Testament
---
You
 do n't read them in the school I suppose?
---
Yes, there is one.

---
when my
 former friend was alive
---
"

" That sounds like what I want." 
---
The Gospel of Nicodemus is very nice
---
when they talked on an indifferent subject
---
Indeed, as now, there was
 ever a second silent conversation passing between their emotions,

---
" It is quite like the
 genuine article. 
---
All cut up into verses, too
---
; so that it is like
. 
---
one of the other evangelists read in a dream,
---
when things are the
 same, yet not the same
---
But, Jude, do you take an interest in those
 questions still? 
---
Are you getting up_
---
" Why do you look at me like that?"
---
" Oh-- do you want?"


---
You must have learnt a lot of everything from your dear
 dead friend!"


---
" We wo n't get on to that now!"
---
" Will you be carving out
 at that church again next week, where you learnt the pretty hymn?"


---
" Yes, perhaps."

" That will be very nice. 
---
It is in
 this direction, and
---
-- aren't we going
---
as we used to

---
you were always going
---
you are a flirt
---
There was a momentary pause,.


---
" It is getting too dark
!... 
---
that make
---
one feel what one should n't
---
We must n't sit and. 
---
Yes-- you must go away,! 
---
for you mistake me
---
in the last
 case they may find.

---
that they ca n't give it continuously to the
 chamber- officer appointed by the bishop's licence to receive it
---
But you are so straightforward, Jude,!... 
---
that you ca n't understand
 me
---
Now you must go.
---
" Are you?"


---
" I perceive I have said that in mere convention!  Honestly I do n't
 think I am sorry.  It does not matter, either way, sad to say!"


---
As they had overdone the grasp of hands some time sooner
---
When do you leave here
---
that runs
---
it goes
 in three- quarters of an hour or so
---
" What will you do with yourself for the time?"


---
" It does seem hard of me! 
---
You have thought enough
 of churches
---
, Heaven knows, without going into one in the dark.
---
" Where you are. 
---
It was so kind and tender of you!... 
---
Oh, my poor friend and comrade, you'll suffer yet!"


---
that the high window- sill was between them,
---
that the social moulds civilization fits us into

---
than the conventional
 shapes of the constellations have to the real star- patterns
---
Now you must n't wait
 longer, or
---
you will lose the coach. 
---
You
 must come to the house then."


---
" When shall it be?"


---
It was impossible, and
---
They were entirely
 in darkness. 
---
The
 mantelpiece was of the same heavy description, carved with Jacobean
 pilasters and scroll- work. 
---
The centuries did, indeed.


---
It was too dark
---
there was an
 unmistakable tearfulness about the dark, long- lashed eyes.


---
if they doubted their own strength
---
if God disposed not
---
We were
    too free, under the influence of that morbid hymn and the
    twilight. 
---
than you can help of

    SUSANNA FLORENCE MARY
---
The disappointment was keen. 
---
You are right. 
---
It is a lesson in
    renunciation which I suppose I ought to learn at this
    season.

   
---
there seemed a finality
 in their decisions. 
---
But other forces and laws than theirs were in
 operation. 
---
across which the short cut was made to the village
---
It was, and
---
so it did n't matter
---
that you was n't here
---
when everything was
 done, and
---
the layers- out had finished their beer, and
---
though two or three days earlier they had
 agreed to mutual severance
---
The funeral is on Friday afternoon.



---
that the grave was finished
---
There was a long time to wait, even now,. 
---
a person alighted,. 
---
the
 conveyance going back,
---
while the passenger began
---
that it would be
 so sad
---
you attend the funeral alone
---
though it wanted some
 time to the burial
---
which
 attached to this hour
---
A pathos so unusually compounded as that was unlikely to repeat itself for years, if
 ever, and
---
The sad and simple ceremony was soon over,. 
---
their progress to the
 church being almost at a trot,
---
; their lives united at least in this last attention
 to the dead.


---
" opposed to marriage, from first to last, you say?
---
" We are rather a sad family,
---
do n't you think, Jude?"


---
we made bad husbands and wives
---
Certainly we make unhappy
 ones. 
---
" Is it wrong, Jude
---
that they are
 unhappy in their marriage
---
If a marriage ceremony is a religious
 thing
---
, it is possibly wrong; but
---
if it is only a sordid contract,
,?"


---
that the male parent should be known--
---
which it seems to

---
why surely a person may say,
---
that it hurts and
---
" Are there many couples,?"


---
do you think,
---
where
 one dislikes the other for no definite fault
---
It would
 be just one of those cases in which my experiences go contrary to my
 dogmas
---
you are not
 happy
---
" Why do you repeat it?... 
---
You will be staying on here
---
This house is gone now.

---
You may
 come part of the way.
---
" But stop-- you ca n't go to- night! 
---
That train wo n't take you to
 Shaston. 
---
You must stay and. 
---
Mrs. Edlin has plenty
 of room,?
---
if you do n't like
---
returning in a few minutes sat down again.


---
" It is horrible-- horrible!"
---
how we are circumstanced, Sue
---
Your part is. 
---
that you
 ought
---
before you had done it
---
what makes
---
you assume all this
---
That's absurd
---
if it comes to that; and
---
that
 you should object to such an innocent action
---
shows
---
that you are
 ridiculously inconsistent
---
" Perhaps it was too prudish
---
it was a sort of trick of ours-- too frequent perhaps
---
There,
 you may hold it as much as you like.
---
Is that good of me?"


---
if you think it necessary
---
as it means nothing

---
" Well-- are you sure?"


---
you mean it only as my cousin
---
" That's news. 
---
How has it come?"


---
you never told me! 
---
" What is it?
---
if it were true then
---
Of course it
 is not now! 
---
" A special Providence helped it on its way."


---
" Ah-- it is n't true!"
---
You are

---
" teasing me-- that's all--!"


---
because you think
---
" it would be my fault, my wickedness;
---
Do you think, Jude,?
---
" It depends upon what they feel for each other."


---
as you have been with
 me
---
Perhaps you have seen?--
---
what it is
---
-- it is a torture to
 me
---
Now
 you'll have a contempt for me for ever
---
as they lay upon the cloth, and silently
 sobbed in little jerks that made the fragile three- legged table
 quiver
---
" And it
 is said. 
---
But that is much like saying that the amputation of a
 limb is no affliction, since a person gets comfortably accustomed to
 the use of a wooden leg or arm in the course of time!"


---
there was something
 wrong, Sue
---
there was
---
" But it is not
---
as you think!--there is nothing wrong except my own
 wickedness
---
you'd call it-- a repugnance on my part, for a
 reason I can not disclose, and
---
what would not be admitted as one by
 the world in general!
---
What tortures me so much
---
That's... 
---
because you must n't
---
you did
---
It all arose through

---
my being married
---
before we met
---
, did n't it? 
---
, would n't you,?"


---
if it had n't been for that
---
as it disappeared behind the night shade
---
that all was
 for the best
---
It was the cry of a rabbit caught in a gin. 
---
As was
 the little creature's habit, it did not soon repeat its cry; and

---
when the trapper would come and

---
If it were a" bad catch" by the hind- leg
---
, the animal would during the ensuing six hours
---
till the iron teeth of the trap had
 stripped the leg- bone of its flesh,
---
when, should a weak- springed
 instrument enable it
---
tug
 to escape, it would die in the fields from the
 mortification of the limb. 
---
If it were a" good catch," namely, by the
 fore- leg, the bone would be broken and the limb nearly torn in two in
 attempts at an impossible escape.


---
the rabbit repeated its cry. 
---
as dragged about by the writhing animal
---
it stretched itself out dead.


---
It is you
---
"-- is it not?"


---
what it suffered
---
They
 ought
---
not to be allowed to set these steel traps, ought they!"


---
" Did it keep you awake?
---
" How was that?"


---
" Oh, you know-- now! 
---
" That may have BEEN my view; but my
 doctrines and I begin to part company."


---
And that's. 
---
to see you again, now the last tie between us, Aunt Drusilla, is
 dead!"


---
" There is a stronger one left!"

---
them go
---
me help you,
---
it!--I know
---
what you mean
---
what you like
---
you were happy
---
So few could enter into my feeling
---
-- they would say
'... 
---
It is none of the natural tragedies of love that's
 love's usual tragedy in civilized life, but
---
a tragedy artificially
 manufactured for people who in a natural state would find relief in
 parting!... 
---
It would have been wrong, perhaps,. 
---
for me to tell my
 distress to you,
---
what marriage meant,
---
It was idiotic of me
---
-- there is no excuse. 
---
only they submit, and
---
When people of a later age
 look back upon the barbarous customs and superstitions of the times

---
that we have the unhappiness to live in
---
, what WILL they say!
---
" You are very bitter, darling Sue! 
---
You must go in now!
---
which led into the lonely road to Alfredston
---
An incident had occurred.


---
They had stood, and
---
their tense and
 passionate moods had led to bewildered inquiries of each other on how
 far their intimacy ought to go;. 
---
till they had almost quarrelled, and

---
that the fact of the kiss
 would be nothing
---
: all would depend upon the spirit of it. 
---
" Will you swear?"
---
that
 it will not be in that spirit
---
And then they had turned from each other in
 estrangement, and.

---
till at a distance
 of twenty or thirty yards both had looked round simultaneously
---
That look behind
---
was fatal to the reserve
---
They had quickly run back, and. 
---
When they parted for good

---
was really the cold truth. 
---
" Is it or
---
is it the
 artificial system of things, under which the normal sex- impulses are
 turned into devilish domestic gins and springs to noose and hold back
 those who want to progress?"


---
It was not
---
which was
---
that, in this country of
 true believers, most of them were not saleable at a much higher price
 than waste- paper value, and
---
with a
 three- pronged fork shook them over the flames. 
---
They kindled, and
.


---
till
 they were
---
a lot gets

---
when you've lived eighty years in one
 house
---
It was nearly one o'clock in the morning before the leaves,, but
---
the rest had gone to ashes
---
the night was quiet, and. 
---
that
 before a thing was done
---
it might be right to do
---
that being done

---
it became wrong;
---
which were right in

---
in other words, that things theory were wrong in practice
---
It was burning, like
---
" a
 lover's-- oh, it was! 
---
whether you think it wrong
---
Oh, did you
---
What did you do that for?"


---
it was hardly a novelty
---
They lapsed into silence. 
---
Had this been a case in the court of an
 omniscient judge
---
, it was a quarter to twelve o'clock. 
---
which by day commanded a view of some thirty or forty
 miles over the Vale of Blackmoor, and even into Outer Wessex
---
which now covered
 the far- reaching scene
---
the committee to change
 the school- stationer
---
All the copybooks are sent wrong this time.
---
There was no reply. 
---
And there must be a rearrangement of that ventilator in the
 class- room. 
---
The wind blows down upon my head unmercifully and."


---
which extended over the walls
 upstairs and down in the dilapidated" Old- Grove Place
---
Thinking forgotten some kitchen detail and
---
" What are you doing down there at midnight!"


---
there is a larger fire here."


---
the tones were small and confined,
 and. 
---
whence they came
---
Under the
 staircase was a large clothes- closet, without a window; they seemed
. 
---
The door was shut, but
---
there was no lock or other
 fastening. 
---
" What are you doing in there?
---
as it was so late
---
" But there's no bed
---
Why, you'll be
!"


---
if you stay all night
---
" You ought!"
---
" It is not becoming in you! 
---
Oh, will you go away
---
; please will you!"


---
it
 is monstrous
---
that you should feel in this way
---
It is wrong and wicked of
 me
---
But it is not I altogether!"


---
that am

---
because they are so horrid and cruel
---
" Well, it is no use talking like that. 
---
if we do n't mind
---
if either of the parsons in this
 town was
---
There's no
 order or regularity in your sentiments!... 
---
you stifled to
---
spiders' webs hung overhead. 
---
the meal began
 almost in silence
---
, the burghers walking past upon the pavement-- or
 rather roadway,. 
---
pavements being scarce here--
---
which was two or three
 feet above the level of the parlour floor
---
They nodded down to the
 happy couple their morning greetings,.


---
as they went on
---
;" would you mind?
---
Why, that's.

---
what you were doing
---
" You would n't like me any the better for telling you."


---
You had got my promise a
 long time before that
---
as time went on
---
Then you know and

---
what scandals were spread,
---
you had taken such time
 and trouble to prepare me for and get me into
---
what was said
---
for it was. 
---
my theoretic
 unconventionality broke down. 
---
If that had not entered into the case

---
it would have been better... 
---
And you
 were so generous in never giving credit for a moment to the rumour.
---
" But you inquired!"


---
" But you have n't answered me. 
---
Will you let? 
---
me go away
---
how
 irregular it is of me
---
I know"

" It is irregular.
---
Domestic laws should be made. 
---
which should be classified
---
If people are at all
 peculiar in character
---
they have!... 
---
that
 produce comfort in others
---
Will you let me?"


---
" But I do ask it! " But we married--"

",
---
if they make you miserable
---
when you know
---
you are committing no sin
---
" But you are committing a sin in not liking me."


---
it would be--
---
that it would be
 so much more than that
---
when one feels
---
There-- I've said it!... 
---
Will you let me, Richard?
---
" I DO But I did n't reflect...  as I do" You distress me, Susanna, by such importunity!"


---
" Why ca n't we agree? 
---
We made the compact, and
 but we can morally,
 especially as no new interests, in the shape of children, have arisen
 to be looked after. 
---
surely we can cancel it-- not legally of course;
---
Then we might be friends, and. 
---
We shall both be
 dead in a few years, and
---
then what will it matter to anybody? 
---
that you
 relieved me from constraint for a little while
---
you think
 me eccentric, or super- sensitive, or something absurd
---
if it does n't hurt other
 people
---
But it does
---
I daresay.  Well-- why
 should I suffer for what I was born to be,?"-- it hurts ME! 
---
And you vowed."


---
" Yes-- that's it! 
---
I am in the wrong.  I always am!  It is as culpable
, and as
 silly as to vow always to like a particular food or drink!"


---
" And do you mean, by living away from me, living by yourself?"


---
if you insisted, yes
---
who lets the world, or
---
J. S. Mill's words,
 those are. 
---
Why ca n't you act upon them?

---
I have been reading it up.  I wish to, always."

" What do I care about J. S. Mill!"" I only want! " You may go on guessing that I am,. 
---
since you have begun
---
me go and

---
Your request prevents
---
Was it seriously made?



---
The child toddled off into the class- room.

---
soon the child returned,
. 
---
These words
 only were pencilled therein:


   
---
God knows.
   
---
My whole thought is. 
---
You would lose everybody's respect
    and regard; and
---
After an interval a similar part was enacted in the class- room, and

---
an answer came:


   
---
you mean my good. 
---
that if I had been I should have asked you I do n't
    know what I am doing!  I am sincerely sorry to say that it was seriously made.


 I do n't want But
    I can not agree to such a preposterous notion as your going
    to live with your lover.  so should I!


 I know But I do n't want!
    To produce" Human development in its richest diversity"( to
    quote your Humboldt) is to my mind far above respectability.
   
---
No doubt my tastes are low-- in your view-- hopelessly low!
   
---
If you won t
---
let, will you grant me this one
    request-- allow me to live in your house in a separate way?



---
what you think
---
But can not you have pity on me? 
---
you to be merciful
---
that Eve had not fallen
---
so that
   ( as the primitive Christians believed
---
some harmless mode of
    vegetation might have peopled Paradise. 
---
Nearly an hour passed, and
---
you KNOW
---
when they met at meals
---
it was nearly two o'clock
---
There was a cry from the bed, and a quick movement. 
---
Before the
 schoolmaster had realized. 
---
which was towards the window
---
This was
---
somewhat
 hidden by the canopy of the bedstead, and
---
that seemed; and
---
though not particularly large in
 general they appeared so now. 
---
" Thank God-- you are not killed! 
---
Though it's not for want of
 trying--
---
" And something frightened me-- a terrible dream--
---
The actual circumstances seemed,
 and
---
" You ought. 
---
" Then no one could intrude even by accident."


---
"-- it wo n't lock. 
---
All the doors are out of order."


---
No further incident touching the matter between them occurred till
 the following evening, when, immediately school was over
---
till the soil changed from its white dryness to a tough brown clay
---
Where Duncliffe is the traveller's mark,
    And
---
Against the sky was Shaston, dimly visible


   
---
On the grey- topp'd height
    Of Paladore, as pale day wore
    Away...[ William Barnes.]



---
The new- lit lights from its windows burnt with a steady shine,. 
---
tempered by the thick damp bed of tenacious clay
---
The air down
 here,, was not,.


---
as it
 had been above, but soft and relaxing
---
They had been schoolmates in
 boyhood, and fellow- students at Wintoncester Training College, many
 years before this time.


---
But you do n't look well! 
---
Gillingham closed the
 cupboard and.


---
Why you have n't been here
---
me see
---
since you were married
---
you know
---
you were out; and
---
upon my word it is such a
 climb after dark. 
---
till the days are longer
 before lumpering up again
---
Though well- trained and even proficient masters, they occasionally
 used a dialect- word of their boyhood to each other in private.


---
so that you, at least, will understand my
 motives
---
if other people question them--, indeed

---
as they may
---
But anything is better than the present condition
 of things. 
---
God forbid!"


---
that you should ever have such an experience
 as mine
---
My wretched state is but-- 
---
" And the sad part of it is, and
---
as you know
---
They seem!

---
one person split in two
---
It is-- but
---
The climax came last night,--
---
it was a dream
---
that was
. 
---
: that it is wrong; and
---
what it may
---
" What-- you'll let? 
---
: something within me tells me. 
---
But is that essentially right, and proper, and
 honourable, or? 
---
it contemptibly mean and selfish
---
principles
 take care of themselves
---
who has blindly walked into a
 quagmire cries for help
---
If a person, I am inclined, if possible.
---
-- you see
---
" But, there's the question of neighbours and society-- what
 will happen if everybody--"

" Oh, I am not going to be a philosopher any longer! 
---
what's under my eyes."


---
" said Gillingham
 gravely. 
---
You said:

---
you are
---
you are in a position
---
it makes all the difference in the world,. 
---
But to go attended by a cavalier
---
-- that makes a
 difference.
---
And, to the best of my
 understanding, it is not an ignoble, merely animal,;. 
---
that is the worst of it
---
because it makes
---
me think
---
their
 affection will be enduring
---
when they were together
 there
---
what they said
---
that an extraordinary affinity, or sympathy, entered into
 their attachment, which somehow took away all flavour of grossness
---
Their supreme desire is.
---
Shelleyan would be nearer to it. 
---
They remind me of--. 
---
if people did
---
as you want
---
The family would no longer be the social unit.
---
", you remember.... 
---
" It will upset all. 
---
Good God-- what will
 Shaston say!"


---
that it wo n't
---
" Now," said Gillingham,
---
us take it quietly
---
of which they drank a rummer each
---
you are

---
That's the bitterness of it! 
---
that this consultation, singular as its subject
 was,
---
no
 sound was audible but that of the purling tributaries of the Stour
---
So Gillingham, my friend, you had no stronger arguments
 against it than those
---
-- that's

---
I hear on all
 sides. Well, I wo n't stay.  I have a
 long walk before me."

" murmured Gillingham,.


---
The next morning came, and
---
:

" You may go--
---
with whom you will
---
Some days passed, and
---
the evening of their last meal together had
 come-- a cloudy evening with wind--. 
---
which indeed was very seldom absent
 in this elevated place
---
marked by the pallors of restless days and nights,
---
" You had better have a slice of ham or an egg, or something with your
 tea? 
---
You ca n't travel on a mouthful of bread and butter."


---
as they sat

---
what little bills were paid, and what
 not
---
as you know
---
If you will send me some of the manuscript to copy at any time
---
as you used to
---
we ought
---
if we are
---
you not to give
 me information as to your movements, or even your address
---
Now,
 what money do you want? 
---
You must have some,"


---
you know.
---
if you do n't mind
---
You are free, absolutely; and
---
your course is your own."


---
you would look into my trunk
---
you would take three- quarters of the household furniture
---
But the rest you
 are welcome to."


---
whenever you like
---
You go by the six- thirty train
---
", do n't you? 
---
It is now a quarter to
 six."


---
" You...  You do n't seem very sorry I am going, Richard!"


---
It is a curious thing

---
because you know
---
But you do seem
 that to me!"


---
then the station omnibus came round. 
---
Soon the noise of
 its wheels died away. 
---
nobody hear
---
, you remember.
---
How is Mrs.--
---
And that's the plate

---
" Have you had any tea, by the by?"
---
" No-- yes-- never mind," said Gillingham, preoccupied. 
---
" Gone, you say

---
they are going
---
Whatever it may be

---
It is a mercy to me. 
---
that you have come
---
Gillingham assented; and. 
---
But certain facts stared me in the face, and
---
They went on with the packing silently. 
---
It is; and
---
it could be done with less
    obtrusiveness after dark
---
you are on the Melchester
    platform
---
But no hesitation was apparent
 therein.


---
The up- train stopped by signal only. 
---
Sue it seemed strange.


---
The twenty minutes' journey drew towards its close, and
---
that the
 train came to a stand- still by the Melchester platform
---
a hand was

---
Are n't we going?
---
" We could n't possibly, do n't you see. 
---
We are known here--
---
here's your
 ticket for the same place,."


---
as you have only one to here
---
we should have stayed here
---
" It would n't have done at all."


---
" There was n't time for me to write and say the place I had decided
 on. 
---
Aldbrickham is a much bigger town-- sixty or seventy thousand
 inhabitants-- and
---
nobody knows anything about us there."


---
" And you have given up your cathedral work here?"


---
It was rather sudden--
---
your message coming unexpectedly.

---
" The Church is no more to me. 
---
it lie
---
_ am not
---
who, row on row
---
if any such there be
---
My point of bliss is not upward, but here."


---
me go so generously and unexpectedly
---
that even this generosity has n't made, or
---
" It may not work so well for us, and
---
" That's rather cruel
---
" Such a strange
 thing has happened to me
---
" What have you done?"


---
But nobody knows about it over here, and
---
it will not be a
 difficult proceeding at all
---
" Then you'll be free?"


---
" Where are we booked for?
---
that
 marked her
---
as I said But it will be very late?"


---
when we get there
---
you might do it
---
which followed
---
Oh-- there's no harm done
---
that...  Is this a sudden change of mind?"


---
" You have no right to ask me such a question; and
---
" My dear one, your happiness is more to me than anything--.

---
although we
 seem often!--and
---
your will is law to me
---
as
 you wish!
---
" But perhaps
 it is!

---
that you do n't love me--
---
not that you have become conventional
---
it IS that,
 not the other terrible alternative
---
If there had been a rope- ladder, and
---
, it would have seemed different, and
---
My nature is not so passionate as yours!"


---
if we
 are not lovers
---
But, we are not. 
---
But even love may be cruel at times. 
---
You are

---
made for each other: it is obvious, palpable, to any unbiased older
 person. 
---
" But you do n't, do you?"


---
" It is true--
---
true!--I do n't."


---
you are
 incapable of real love
---
" That's not good and loyal of you!"
---
But it is a delight in being with you,
 of a supremely delicate kind, and
---
" Of course, if it would make... but
---
you reproach yourself
---
you do
 like me very much, Sue? 
---
you do
---
that you do a quarter, a
 tenth, as much as I do you
---
you kiss me
---
that tells enough.
---
" This is a queer elopement!"
---
Upon my word it
 almost seems so--!"


---
you sitting up there so prim
---
" Now you must n't be angry
---
" You did kiss me just now,; and
---
you know
---
you
 do it again
---
how we are circumstanced
---
, do n't
 you see!"


---
And
 they sat side by side with joined hands,.


---
" You can see well enough!"


---
" Very well; there'll be some other one open, no doubt. 
---
that under the affectation of independent views you are
---
though
 you tortured yourself to death by doing it
---
if you will put it
---
" Well-- brutally!--it was a little like that-- that
 and
---
the scandal together-- and your concealing from me what you ought
!"


---
if
 you will
---
You know
---
you are all the world to me,!"


---
whatever you do
---
-- you think that!
---
they reached the end of their journey
 on the best of terms. 
---
It was about ten o'clock. 
---
when they arrived at
 Aldbrickham, the county town of North Wessex
---
their now entering it by another door
---
When they
 had engaged their respective rooms
---
they went down to a late supper.

---
that was n't you by no manner of means-- jest as med
 be with you now."


---
" Oh do you?"
---
you must be mistaken
---
How long ago was it?"


---
They had
 this room."


---
it is not so nice and pleasant
---
" How fidgeted you seem, dear! 
---
Why do you change like this?"


---
Because it was cruel
---
There, now I have said it!"

" Dear me, why--" said. 
---
" Yes-- it is the same!

---
Well-- it is not cruel,
---
since we have

---
as we have
---
come-- two relations staying together."


---
I really did n't know it, Sue. " How long ago was it
---
you were here? 
---
when we went back to
 Marygreen together
---
you did n't tell me all. 
---
Your
 story was."


---
" We did n't make it up
---
" You've been false to me; you, my last hope! 
---
" But by your own wish, dear Sue, we are only! 
---
It is!"


---
so very inconsistent of you to--"

" Friends can be jealous
---
You concede nothing to me and
---
Oh how can you think so! 
---
And you have taken me
 in,." 
---
even if you did n't intend to
---
lest the people
 should hear
---
" Was it this room? 
---
Yes it was--
---
Oh it was treacherous of you! 
---
" Oh do n't you UNDERSTAND my feeling? 
---
Why do n't you? 
---
Why are you so
 gross? 
---
It was true. 
---
you cared for nobody
---
It is true. 
---
-- you do n't understand me either
---
Why
 should you get into such a tantrum about nothing?"


---
If it had n't been
 for that
---
as you proposed
---
" Oh, it is of no consequence!"
---
My sense of it
 was,."


---
It is a crime--.
---
as the world treats it, but

---
" There-- now you are yourself again. 
---
Yes, it is a crime-- as you do n't
 hold, but would fearfully concede. 
---
So you perceive."


---
" And you did n't really know anything of this?"
---
you ought
---
It is more than this earthly wretch called Me
 deserves-- you spirit, you disembodied creature, you dear, sweet,
 tantalizing phantom-- hardly flesh at all;
---
them to pass through you as through air
---
as you call it
---
that our
 calling cousins when really strangers was a snare
---
The enmity of our
 parents gave a piquancy to you in my eyes that was intenser even than
 the novelty of ordinary new acquaintance."


---
as if
 they meant me
---
as they
 stood
---
" Do n't you know them?"


---
" Do n't you? 
---
These are some of them
---
:


    There was.

       
---
Oh it is too flattering,
---
it's me
---
it's me!"


---
" It is you, dear; exactly like you!"


---
And you shall kiss me just once there-- not very
 long." 
---
" You do care for me very much
---
, do n't you, in spite
 of my not
---
-- you know?"


---
, they
 said--.


---
When, however, a month had passed, and

---
, curiosity began;
---
till,
 jumping to conclusions, people ventured. 
---
" You'll excuse my asking, Phillotson,
---
since everybody is talking of
 it
---
: is this true as to your domestic affairs--
---
was on no visit, but a secret elopement with a lover? 
---
" There was no secret about it."


---
" Then what has happened?"


---
The chairman looked.


---
is quite true
---
The children observed. 
---
The chairman of
 committee thought the matter over, and. 
---
The meeting lasted a long time, and
---
at the end the
 school- master came home,. 
---
" Well; it is,. 
---
as you said
---
" They have requested me or,. 
---
as they call it,
---
It is no business of theirs. 
---
It does n't affect me in my
 public capacity at all. 
---
They may expel me."


---
if they like
---
If you make a fuss
---
" it will get into the papers, and
---
you'll never get

---
You see
---
, they have-- and its effects as such upon
 the morals of the town; and,. 
---
what
 you did
---
as done by a teacher of youth
---
to ordinary opinion, your position is
 indefensible
---
You must let."


---
me say that
---
Gillingham saw; but
---
in due time-- indeed, in a quarter of an hour-- the formal letter of
 dismissal arrived
---
, the managers having remained behind. 
---
The latter replied; and. 
---
that the matter was a
 domestic theory which did not concern them
---
they over- ruled
---
This,
 insisting. 
---
that the private eccentricities of a teacher came quite
 within their sphere of control,
---
how an act of natural
 charity could injure morals
---
It has been stated. 
---
that Shaston was the anchorage of a curious and
 interesting group of itinerants, who frequented the numerous fairs
 and
---
markets held up and down Wessex during the summer and autumn
 months
---
The body included two cheap Jacks, a shooting- gallery proprietor
 and the ladies who loaded the guns, a pair of boxing- masters, a
 steam- roundabout manager, two travelling broom- makers, who called
 themselves widows, a gingerbread- stall keeper, a swing- boat owner,
 and a" test- your- strength" man.


---
whose own domestic experiences had been not without
 vicissitude
---
This generous phalanx of supporters, and a few others of independent
 judgment,, came up and; after
. 
---
which they expressed their thoughts so strongly to the meeting that
 issue was joined,
---
the result being a general scuffle, wherein a black
 board was split
---
, three panes of the school windows were broken
---
,
 an inkbottle was spilled over a town- councillor's shirt front,

---
many black eyes and
 bleeding noses were given, one of which, to everybody's horror,
---
the blood running down the rector's face
---
Gillingham came, and
---
you are ill
---
When Gillingham reached home
---
when the sun was going down in
 splendour over the lowlands of Blackmoor, and
---
somebody come to the house
---
a
 few minutes after there was a tap at the bedroom door
---
; the door was hesitatingly opened, and
---
you were ill
---
you had not come
---
It is a little
 too soon
---
-- that's all I mean. 
---
us make the best of it
---
You
 have n't heard about the school
---
we are going to part
---
-- that's all."


---
; it never once seemed, and
---
They talked on slight and ephemeral subjects, and
---
that a cup was
---
That young person was much more interested in their history
 than they supposed, and
---
While they sipped
---
It is such a beautiful sunset,
 Richard
---

as they do n't shine into this
 gloomy corner where I lie

" Would n't you like? 
---
It is like heaven

---
" No-- the bedstead ca n't be shifted."

" But."


---
where it could catch the sunshine
---
" There-- you can see the great red sun now!
---
it will

" You are an odd creature!"
---
your coming
---
what has passed
---
us go back upon that
---
You do n't hate me
---
, do you? 
---
You
 have been such a kind friend to me!"


---
It grew dusk quickly in the gloomy room during their intermittent
 chat, and
---
when candles were brought and
---
it was time to leave
---
It was bad policy
---
" Sue" do you wish, and? 
---
Oh you ca n't
---
", you ca n't!
---
" You ca n't condone it
 now!"


---
" You may assume it. 
---
It is altogether news to me."


---
" It was a bad marriage."


---
You ca n't have me back now
---
which made

As you are not so ill

Gillingham noticed.


---
since you called last
---
You have made it up?"


---
" Well-- I'm hanged! 
---
" What do you say?"


---
" What do you mean?"


---
that fact would afford me opportunity of doing it,

---
What's the use of keeping

-- there's no use in mincing
 words

course is...

And for worldly reasons,
 too, it will be better.

 remainder of my life

that what has
 suggested

For then they'll be able to marry,."

Gillingham did not hurry.

Part Fifth


 AT ALDBRICKHAM AND ELSEWHERE



   " Thy aerial part, and all the fiery parts mingled in thee,
---
though by nature they have an upward
     tendency, still in obedience to the disposition of the
     universe
---
they are here in the compound
     mass the body."--
---
How Gillingham's doubts were disposed of
---
that followed

---
The proceedings in the
 law- courts had reached their consciousness, but as a distant sound
 and an occasional missive which they hardly understood.


---
They had met, as usual,,. 
---
" Well; and what is it about?"
---
Both cases had been too
 insignificant to be reported in the papers, further than by name in
 a long list of other undefended cases.


---
" Now then, Sue, at any rate, you can do!" 
---
what you like
---
" Are we-- you and I-- just as free now?"


---
as if we had never married at
 all
---
" Just as free-- except that a clergyman may object
."


---
do you think? 
---
it is really so with us
---
it is
 generally
---
if the truth about us had been known
---
--, the decree would n't have

---
It is only
---
, is it,? 
---
because we have made no defence,
 and
---
Therefore is my freedom
 lawful
---
, however proper it may be?"


---
" Well-- why did you let? 
---
it be under false pretences
---
You have only
 yourself
---
You ought. 
---
You must
 take me."


---
Perhaps you were right. 
---
As to your
 question, we were not obliged. 
---
That was their
 business. 
---
Anyhow we are living together."


---
" One thing is certain,
---
that however the decree may be brought
 about
---
, a marriage is dissolved. 
---
when it is dissolved
---
There is this
 advantage in being poor obscure people like us-- that these things are
 done for us in a rough and ready fashion. 
---
It was the same with me
 and Arabella. 
---
-- nobody inquired,
---
nobody suspected it. 
---
If we'd been patented
 nobilities
---
we should have had infinite trouble, and
---
days and weeks
 would have been spent in investigations.
---
that they should take a walk in the fields,

---
even if they had
---
" Now we'll strut arm and arm
---
We've a legal right to."


---
They rambled out of the town, and along a path over the low- lying
 lands that bordered it, though these were frosty now, and the
 extensive seed- fields were bare of colour and produce. 
---
The pair,
 however, were so absorbed in their own situation.


---
that their
 surroundings were little in their consciousness
---
" Well, my dearest, the result of all this is."


---
that we can marry after
 a decent interval
---
we can
---
" And are n't we going to?"


---
lest an
 iron contract should extinguish your tenderness for me, and mine for
 you, as it did between our unfortunate parents
---
"

" Still, what can we do? 
---
as you know
---
as we are living now, and only meeting by day
---
And henceforward we need n't be so particular.
---
we have

---
Our experiences of matrimony with others have not been encouraging
---
But we
 two--"

" Should be two dissatisfied ones linked together, which would be
 twice as bad as before... 
---
you had contracted
---
to be loved on the premises by
 you
---
as you are, free
---
" No, no-- don't say!"
---
yet there was

---
If the
 marriage ceremony consisted in an oath and signed contract between
 the parties to cease loving from that day forward, in consideration
 of personal possession being given, and to avoid each other's society
 as much as possible in public
---
, there would be more loving couples
. 
---
than there are now
---
There'd
 be then.
---
" Yes; but admitting this, or something like it, to be true, you are
 not the only one in the world to see it, dear little Sue. 
---
People go
 on marrying. 
---
because they ca n't resist natural forces,
---
although many
 of them may know perfectly well
---
that they are possibly buying a
 month's pleasure with a life's discomfort
---
if they at all resembled
 us in habits of observation
---
But then they went and. 
---
because they had ordinary passions
---
But you, Sue, are such a
 phantasmal, bodiless creature, one who-- if you'll allow me to say
 it-- has so little animal passion in you, that you can act upon reason
 in the matter, when we poor unfortunate wretches of grosser substance
."


---
," you've owned. 
---
that it would probably end in
 misery for us
---
as you think
---
than you suppose
---
that you can not
---
" And you are so
 reticent. 
---
But the highest form of
 affection is based on full sincerity on both sides. 
---
even if caught by airy affectations of dodging and parrying
---
retained by them
---
under which they allow
---
, who was,
---
" Do n't you? 
---
" Oh, well-- you are not nice-- too sermony. 
---
" No, you are not bad. 
---
You are a dear. 
---
It is no use your
! 
---
who are good
---
People do n't want... 
---
nobody to defend me
---
But now,
 it is very hard!"


---
It is too
 wicked of you! 
---
Now we wo n't say any more about it,
 and."


---
as we have done
---
during the rest of our
 walk we'll talk of the meadows only, and the floods, and the prospect
 of the farmers this coming year
---
After this the subject of marriage was not mentioned by them for
 several days,
---
as they were with only a landing between
 them
---
it was constantly in their minds. 
---
It was a lower class of handicraft, and
---
It was an evening at the end of the month, and
---
Are you depressed
---
" Somebody has called?"


---
you were not at home
---
" Heaven save us! 
---
What made
---
you think

---
it was
---
But that was. 
---
-- it was,
---
It seems such an ill omen,
. 
---
,
 could you?"


---
than there came a knock
---
" How do you know?"


---
They listened, and
---
the knocking came again. 
---
No servant was kept in
 the house, and
---
if the summons were
---
Whoever it is
---
" can not be expected."


---
that it was
---
" What do you want, Arabella?"
---
nobody to help me
---
" In trouble, are you?"


---
There was a silence. 
---
An inconvenient sympathy seemed. 
---
" But are n't you married?
---
But it takes time, and
---
" You are not really in want of money, Arabella?"
---
" Where are you living?"


---
If you could come down and
---
You may as well, for old time's
 sake!"


---
" it ca n't make much difference."


---
" But you can go and to- morrow, Jude! 
---
Oh, it is only to
 entrap you,
---
it is
---
God
 knows, but
---
you are not either, dear, yet
---
you to be
---
it would be futile to

---
It would
 occupy about seven minutes;
 seven to come back again. 
---
It was twenty- five
 minutes to eleven. 
---
as they
 would reach it before closing time
---
Heaven only knew.


---
It seemed, and
---
as if the whole time
 had nearly elapsed
---
when the door was opened again
---
good you are!"--she began.


---
as it is beginning to rain
---
one ca n't be
 a brute in such circumstances
---
" You MUSTN'T go out! 
---
It is n't right! 
---
How can you forget such
 a thing, my dear, dear one!"


---
What
 those legal fellows have been playing at in London
---
That's! 
---
There's the absurdity!--

---
Well-- you'll come straight back, after a few minutes, wo n't you,
 dear? 
---
for you to talk to long, Jude, and

---
-- that was
---
it was
 so preposterous of me
---
that's best and noblest in me
---
that's gross
---
your freedom from
 everything has elevated me, and. 
---
" Yes, you have been good to me,
---
you have
---
if you must
---
, you must!
---
that seemed
---
you are deserting me! 
---
if you were."


---
Since you will have it so
---
that you would conquer in the long run,
---
that it would be unfair to you
---
it is only bare
 justice to say that
---
The next morning it was wet.


---
as this is Saturday

---
the first
 publishing done to- morrow
---
we shall lose a week. 
---
Banns will do?

---
We shall save a pound or two."


---
" It was
 sheer unkindness in me-- or worse--. 
---
That's some more of my badness
---
Love has its own
 dark morality... 
---
when rivalry enters in-- at least, mine has,
---
if other
 people's has n't
---
," said Jude placidly.


---
Do you mind my putting on my waterproof and going to

---
if you want
---
you can
---
this going to

---
when you come back
---
cloak and umbrella letting Jude kiss
 her freely
---
Times had decidedly changed. 
---
" The little bird is caught at
 last!"
---
that the latter had not yet risen
---
a frowsiness was apparent this morning; and
---
if you got back comfortably last night
---
that's all
---
that you
 might have met with any mishap
---
" Oh-- how stupid this is! 
---
my visitor was-- your friend-- your
 husband-- Mrs.
---
you call yourself
---
you might have
---
Decency is decency, any hour of the twenty- four."


---
what you mean
---
," said Sue stiffly. 
---
if you
 come to that
---
How do you know
---
when you talked to me at the door
---
Well, my dear,
 you've been quick about it, and
---
my visit last night helped
 it on-- ha- ha! 
---
In the
 pause there was a knock at the door, and the chambermaid brought in a
 telegram for" Mrs. Cartlett."


---
it is not necessary. 
---
you should
 feel it
---
to knock me about
, any more after we are spliced by English law
 than before!... 
---
money matters work better. 
---
And then, you
 see,, and
---
if you have rows
---
as there was a little flaw in the
 first ceremony
---
which this is an answer
 to
---
if it had n't been
 for you
---
then how different our histories
 might have been from to- day! 
---
as it happens
---
However,, it is just as
 well, and
---
the business legally done as soon as possible
---
You'll find it an awful bother later on if you do n't."


---
" Ah, yes-- you are a oneyer too, like myself,
---
" Bolted from your first, did n't
 you, like me?"


---
" Good morning!--I must go
---
replied the other,. 
---
You
 think not. 
---
they
 went along silently together,. 
---
as true comrades oft- times do
---
And yet it is best.
---
has made

---
me feel more than ever
---
you put up the banns this
 morning
---
Any time will do for me. 
---
you might

---
possessed by your family and mine
---
you really are mine. 
---
" Sue, you seem. 
---
when you are like this wasted, classical days, rather than a denizen of a mere Christian
 country
---
you to say at these times
---
that you have

---
whom you met in the Via Sacra
---
They had now reached the house of the parish clerk. 
---
" Wait a minute, would you mind?"


---
us think
---
when people were tied up
---
how when couples
 quarrelled... 
---
Jude, do you think? 
---
when you must have me with
 you by law
---
that, we shall be so happy as we are now
---
when everything depends upon their
 goodwill
---
they always kick against compulsion. 
---
Do n't you
 dread the attitude that insensibly arises out of legal obligation?

---
Do n't you think?"


---
it is destructive to a passion whose essence is its
 gratuitousness
---
" Upon my word, love, you are beginning this foreboding! 
---
's go back and
---
-- so we will!
---
And they turned
 from the clerk's door,
---
Can you keep the bee from ranging,
    Or the ring- dove's neck from changing?
   
---
They thought it over, or postponed thinking. 
---
Certainly they
 postponed action, and.

---
At the end of a fortnight or three weeks matters remained unadvanced,
 and
---
no banns were announced to the ears of any Aldbrickham
 congregation.


---
Whilst they were postponing and
---
The paper was one that circulated in South
 London only, and
---
" Well, it is satisfactory
---
" Though, after
 this, it seems rather low, and
---
Mr.
    Fawley),--I send to- day a newspaper, from which useful
    document you will learn that I was married over again to
    Cartlett last Tuesday
---
So that business is settled right
    and tight at last. 
---
But is that private affair I wanted to speak to you on. 
---
you
    know it by word of mouth,
---
The fact is, Jude,
---
that is
    easily provable
---
such a thing was going
---
our quarrel had been sharp
---
so my parents took the child,
    and
---
That was. 
---
as they have rather a hard struggle over there,
    and
---
that,, they do n't see
---
why
    they should be encumbered with the child any longer
---
They have, however,
   
---
who
    happened
---
If anybody
    says
---
" What will you do, dear?
---
" It hits me hard!"
---
" It MAY be true!

---
if ever we lived
 together again
---
" The poor child seems!" 
---
to be wanted by nobody
---
what is it, after all? 
---
What does it matter
---
when you come

---
, to think of it, whether a child is yours by blood or not? 
---
All the
 little ones of our time are collectively the children of us adults of
 the time, and. 
---
That excessive regard of
 parents for their own children, and their dislike of other people's,
 is, like class- feeling, patriotism, save- your- own- soul- ism, and other
 virtues, a mean exclusiveness at bottom."


---
" Yes-- so
 it is, dearest! 
---
what is most pleasing to you
---
the day perish wherein I
 was born, and
---
in which it was said
---
the night, There is a man child
 conceived
---
That's!"


---
we can afford.

---
When shall we have courage to marry
---
Whenever you have it
---
It remains with you
 entirely, dear. 
---
it's done."


---
that was timed
---
In the down- train to reach Aldbrickham station about
 ten o'clock the next evening, a small, pale child's face could
 be seen in the gloom of a third- class carriage. 
---
even when a station was reached and
---
then, whereupon the kitten would
 put out its head, and. 
---
All laughing comes from misapprehension
---
Rightly
 looked at, there is no laughable thing under the sun."


---
Occasionally, at a stoppage, the guard would look into the compartment
 and. 
---
Your box is safe in the
 van." 
---
Age masquerading as Juvenility, and. 
---
A ground- swell from ancient
 years of night seemed now and.


---
what it saw
---
When the other travellers closed their eyes,
---
which they did one by
 one
---
This very day, the child
 reached the London Docks, and
---
late as it was getting
---
who was out
---
The train reached Aldbrickham, and
---
" Going to Spring Street," said the little one impassively.


---
" Why, that's a long way from here
---
; a'most out in the country; and the
 folks will be gone to bed."


---
" I've got."

" You must have a fly for your box."


---
I must walk."

" Oh well: you'd better leave your box here and. 
---
There's

---
a' bus goes half- way, but
---
you'll have.
---
" I am not afraid."

" Why did n't your friends come?"


---
they did n't know
---
" I suppose I was coming."

" Who is your friends?"


---
me to say
---
" All I can do, then, is. 
---
as
 you can
---
that nobody followed or
---
The child fell into a steady mechanical creep which had in it an
 impersonal quality-- the movement of the wave, or of the breeze, or
 of the cloud. 
---
It could have been seen. 
---
Children
 begin with detail, and
---
learn up to the general; they begin with the
 contiguous, and. 
---
whose
 supersensitiveness was disturbed
---
What's the matter
---
" is true-- true! 
---
" Well: that's one thing in my life, at any rate."


---
as it should be
---
And that's!

---
I'll try
---
Time may right things... 
---
We'll educate and.

---
They are making it easier for poor students now,
---
you
 know."


---
" Oh you dreamer!"
---
" Is it you?
---
Then a yearning look came over the child and
---
which the least wind of emotion from another's heart could make

---
What's this round your neck
---
that's at the station
---
They bustled about and. 
---
Both went and.


---
" Was n't it odd!"


---
" Well-- it was significant
---
" There's more for us to think
 about in that one little hungry heart than in all the stars of the
 sky... 
---
dear, we must pluck up courage, and? 
---
It is no use struggling against the current, and
---
myself getting intertwined with my kind
---
Oh Jude, you'll love
 me dearly,
---
wo n't you, afterwards? 
---
our adding the legal form to
 our marriage
---
might make it easier for me."

IV


 Their next and second attempt thereat was more deliberately made,
.


---
though it was begun on the morning
---
Him they found.


---
" What is
 your name, dear? 
---
Did you tell us?"


---
" Little Father Time is. 
---
what they always called me
---
It is a nickname
---
;
, they say.
---
" And you talk so, too
---
" It is strange, Jude,
. 
---
But what were you christened?
---
" Why was that?"

"."


---
" Oh-- your name is not Jude, then?"
---
We'll have
---
:" The
 day we are married.
---
Their position lent them shyness, and
---
that a
 marriage at a superintendent registrar's office was more private than
 an ecclesiastical one
---
, they decided.

---
to give
 notice: they had become such companions that they could hardly do
 anything of importance except in each other's company.


---
as it traced the words
---
,, their love for each other, was supposed
---
" Names and Surnames of the Parties"--(they were
---
in which the Marriage is
---
in which the Parties respectively dwell
---
It spoils the sentiment
---
", does n't it!"
---
" It seems. 
---
There is a little poetry in a church. 
---
But
 we'll try.
---
" We will. 
---
So said the Jewish
 law- giver."


---
How you know the Scriptures
---
You really ought. 
---
as the Rubric directed
---
-- it being in fact only ten o'clock--
---
they all sat by the fire till a late
 hour--;.


---
Father Time included
---
I can only quote profane writers!"

" Well, I bain't set against marrying," said
 the widow. 
---
twill be a jocund wedding for ye in all

---
Nobody can hope it more,. 
---
which is more
---
For they have been unlucky that way
---
, God knows.
---
" They was always good- hearted people, too--,
---
if
 they knowed it
---
" But things happened
, and
---
if everything was n't vitty
---
they were upset. 
---
that's
---
" And I hope' respects this time.  what I do
 of your families,, I suppose, than anybody else now
 living" What was that?"
---
, ye know
---
that was gibbeted just on the brow of
 the hill by the Brown House-- not far from the milestone between
 Marygreen and Alfredston, where the other road branches off
---
it medn' have been one of
 your folk at all."


---
the gibbet is said
---
the child died. 
---
being
 obstinate, would n't tell
---
They brought it in
 burglary, and
---
that's. 
---
But it medn't be true
."


---
A small slow voice rose from the shade of the fireside, as if out of
 the earth
---
It came
 from little Time, and
---
they started,.


---
" Oh, it is only a tale
---
they rose
---
whose nervousness intensified with the
 hours
---
you to kiss me, as a lover, incorporeally
---
It wo n't be ever
 like this any more
---
", will it? 
---
we had n't begun the business
---
we must go on
---
How horrid that story was last night!

---
It spoilt my thoughts of to- day.
---
It makes."


---
me feel
---
as if a tragic doom
 overhung our family,
---
as it did the house of Atreus
---
" Or the house of Jeroboam," said the quondam theologian.


---
And it seems awful temerity in us two! 
---
to vow to you in the same words; regardless
 of the deterrent lesson we were taught by those experiments!"


---
If you are uneasy
---
if you do n't
---
But, you do n't.
---
It is no use
 pretending. 
---
It is a dismal business to you, and
---
that makes it so to
 me!"


---
" It is unpleasantly like that other morning--
---
that's all
---
us go on now
---
They started arm in arm for the office aforesaid, no witness
 accompanying them except the Widow Edlin. 
---
The day was chilly and
 dull, and
---
a clammy fog blew through the town from" Royal- tower'd
 Thame." 
---
On the steps of the office there were the muddy foot- marks
 of people who had entered, and
---
Within the office several persons were gathered, and
---
our couple
 perceived. 
---
that a marriage between a soldier and a young woman was
 just in progress
---
while this was going on
---
The room was a dreary place to two of their temperament,
 though to its usual frequenters
---
Law- books in musty calf covered one wall, and
---
Papers in
 packets tied with red tape were, and
---
some iron
 safes filled a recess,.


---
while the bare wood floor was, like the
 door- step, stained by previous visitors
---
The soldier was sullen and reluctant: the bride sad and timid
---
Their little business was soon done, and
---
That fellow is just out of gaol this morning.

---
They jocosely saluted the outgoing couple, and. 
---
whose diffidence was increasing
---
The latter drew
 back and! 
---
we had n't come
---
The place gives
 me the horrors
---
: it seems so unnatural as the climax of our love!

---
it had been at church,
---
if it had
---
It is not so
 vulgar there!"


---
" How troubled and pale you look!"


---
It must be performed here now
---
" No-- we need not marry here or
 anywhere,
---
unless we like, even now
---
us go out dear
---
till you are calmer,
---
They went out stealthily and guiltily,
---
as if they had committed a
 misdemeanour,
---
who had remained in the entry,
---
closing the door without noise, and telling the widow,
 to go home and await them; that they
 would call in any casual passers as witnesses, if necessary. 
---
When
 in the street they turned into an unfrequented side alley where they
 walked up and down as they had done long ago in the market- house at
 Melchester.


---
" Now, darling, what shall we do? 
---
We are making a mess of it
---
, it
 strikes me. 
---
that pleases
---
Still, ANYTHING you will please me."


---
You wanted
---
it to be there
---
,
 did n't you?"


---
The place depressed me almost as much as it
 did you
---
-- it was ugly. 
---
They walked on vaguely,
---
It seems so weak, too,! 
---
How terrible that
 scene was to me! 
---
whom to avoid for ever
---
This is our parish church
---
, is n't it? 
---
This is? 
---
it would have,
---
if we did it in the usual way
---
A service or
 something seems."


---
" Why-- it is a wedding here
 too
---
" Everybody seems."


---
it was
---
because Lent was just over,
---
when there
 was always a crowd of marriages
---
us listen
---
how it feels to us
---
They stepped in, and. 
---
The contracting couple appeared, and
---
the wedding altogether was of ordinary
 prettiness and interest. 
---
They could see, and. 
---
the flowers tremble in the
 bride's hand, even at that distance
---
seemed
---
as it would be to me
---
You see
---
", they
 are fresh to it, and.

---
But having been awakened to its awful solemnity by experience, and
---
as we have, or at
 least as I have,
---
to my own too squeamish feelings
 perhaps sometimes, it really does seem immoral in me. 
---
this has frightened me from a church wedding as much as the
 other did from a registry one
---
We are a weak, tremulous pair,
 Jude, and what others may feel confident in
---
Then they tried, and. 
---
they were
 both too thin- skinned
---
that they ought
---
-- much
 less have come together for the most preposterous of all joint
 ventures for THEM-- matrimony
---
that they ought
---
" It is awful
---
if you think ourselves not strong enough for it, and knowing this
---
we have found

---
since you ask me
---
if you wish,
---
We
 are horribly sensitive
---
than we think
---
The intention of the contract is good, and
 right for many, no doubt; but
---
in our case it may defeat its own ends
."


---
because we are the queer sort of people we are-- folk in whom domestic
 ties of a forced kind snuff out cordiality and spontaneousness
---
that there was not much queer or exceptional in them:

---
that all were so
---
" Everybody is getting. 
---
as we do
---
We are
 a little beforehand
---
, that's all. 
---
In fifty, a hundred, years the
 descendants of these two will act and. 
---
They
 will see."


---
than we do now
---
Thus they murmured on,? 
---
" Well-- the general question is not our business, and
---
why should we
 plague ourselves about it
---
However different our reasons are: that for us particular two, an irrevocable
 oath is risky. 
---
, we come
 to the same conclusion
---
us go home without killing our dream
---
How good you are, my friend
---
: you give way to all my whims!"


---
" They accord very much with my own."


---
while the attention of
 everybody present was taken up in observing the bridal procession
 entering the vestry
---
then they came outside the building. 
---
By the
 door they waited till two or three carriages, which had gone away for
 a while
---
" The flowers in the bride's hand are sadly like the garland which
 decked the heifers of sacrifice in old times!"


---
That's
;."


---
had by this
 time driven off
---
The bride and bridegroom, and the two moved away with the rest of the idlers.

---
" No-- don't let
---
's do it
---
They reached home, and. 
---
" Well," cried their guest
---
when they entered
---
They
 made up their minds at last, then
---
They briefly hinted.


---
that they had not
---
" Well," cried their guest when they entered," I
 said to myself when I zeed ye coming so loving up to the door,'!'" What-- and ha'n't ye really done it? 
---
spoiled like this by you two
---
' Tis time sakes if tidden--! 
---
if this is
---
what the new notions be

---
Nobody thought
---
that I should
 have lived I got back again
 to Marygreen-- Why when
 I and my poor man were married we thought no more o't than of a game
 o' dibs!"


---
it has all gone on right
---
it will be better. 
---
Of course it is only put off
 for reconsideration. 
---
If we are happy
---
as we are
---
, what does it matter
 to anybody?"




---
That the twain were happy-- between their times of sadness--
---
was
 indubitable. 
---
that brought into their lives a new and tender
 interest of an ennobling and unselfish kind
---
one, it rather helped than
.


---
as they were
---
But the pair tried.


---
There is in Upper Wessex an old town of nine or ten thousand souls
---
;
 the town may be called Stoke- Barehills. 
---
It stands with its gaunt,
 unattractive, ancient church, and its new red brick suburb, amid
 the open, chalk- soiled cornlands, near the middle of an imaginary
 triangle which has for its three corners the towns of Aldbrickham
 and Wintoncester, and the important military station of Quartershot.

---
The great western highway from London passes through it, near a point
 where the road branches into two,. 
---
But the question
 is now as dead as the scot- and- lot freeholder, the road waggoner,
 and the mail coachman who disputed it; and
---
for nobody now drives up and
 down the great western highway dally
---
The most familiar object in Stoke- Barehills nowadays is its cemetery,
;
 the modern chapels, modern tombs, and modern shrubs having a look of

---
which has now been
 reached by this narrative
---
the month being early June
---
though many visitors arrive by
 the trains
---
On a certain day, however, in the particular year---- the features
 of the town excite little interest,; some down- trains, in especial, nearly emptying themselves
 here. 
---
It is the week of the Great Wessex Agricultural Show, whose
 vast encampment spreads over the open outskirts of the town like
 the tents of an investing army. 
---
Rows of marquees, huts, booths,
 pavilions, arcades, porticoes-- every kind of structure short of
 a permanent one-- cover the green field for the space of a square
 half- mile, and
---
the crowds of arrivals walk through the town in
 a mass, and. 
---
thereto is lined with shows, stalls, and hawkers on foot, who make
 a market- place of the whole roadway to the show proper, and lead
 some of the improvident to lighten their pockets appreciably before
.


---
they reach the gates of the exhibition they came expressly to see
---
It is the popular day, the shilling day, and. 
---
of the fast arriving
 excursion trains two from different directions enter the two
 contiguous railway stations at almost the same minute
---
which have preceded it
---
One, like
 several, comes from London
---
They cast their eyes around. 
---
It is n't so very far to the show- yard. 
---
us walk down
 the street into the place
---
It is years--.
---
," said,; for
 they had both come down from the tavern in that" excellent, densely
 populated, gin- drinking neighbourhood,".

---
which they had occupied ever

---
since the advertisement in those words had attracted them thither
---
The configuration of the landlord showed.


---
it sent
---
They sauntered on, but
---
into which the train from Aldbrickham had

---
They were walking just in front of the inn- keepers.


---
" What's that?
---
" said Cartlett.

" Who do you think that couple is? 
---
whatever it might have

---
that is told
---
it was easy
---
" They are rather fond of one another and of their child, seemingly,
---
" They have n't been married long enough!"


---
for it
 to be theirs
---
" They are only lovers, or lately married, and."


---
as anybody can see
---
All continued. 
---
which should combine exercise and amusement with
 instruction
---
Not regardful of themselves alone,
 they had taken care,. 
---
But they soon
 ceased, and. 
---
which the shyest can scarcely disguise,
---
as they imagined
---
which these, among entire strangers, took less
 trouble to disguise than they might have done at home
---
in which every glance
 and movement was as effectual as speech for conveying intelligence
 between them
---
That complete mutual understanding,, made them almost the two parts of a single whole.


---
that the two ahead began,; and
---
they are not
 married
---
they would n't be so much to one another as that... 
---
you said
---
" I heard-- that's all,,
 after putting it off once or twice... 
---
as they themselves are
 concerned they are the only two in the show
---
if you had n't said
 so
---
You never see anything
---
There-- now they are going across
 to the cart- horse sheds. 
---
It is no business of ours. 
---
If we have come
---
to see the show let,."


---
us see it in
 our own way
---
as they do in theirs
---
we agree
---
Then you
 can look at what you choose to, and
---
where malting processes were being exhibited
---
Anny had burst out in hearty laughter at the mere fact of the chance
 encounter. 
---
my intended
 could n't come up here to- day. 
---
But there's lots of us come by
 excursion,.
---
" Well, they are close by here somewhere. 
---
Yes-- there they are-- by
 that grey horse!"


---
did you say? 
---
You ought.
---
Anny laughed. 
---
" That's you, Arabella! 
---
" And perhaps, Abby dear, you do n't know.
---
Ah-- they are making for the art
 department. 
---
we go that way?-- 
---
if all Wessex is n't here
---
There's Dr. Vilbert. 
---
How do you do,

---
that you do n't look a day older than

---
Only two
 and threepence a box-- warranted efficacious by the Government stamp.

---
me advise you
---
when the pills were paid for
---
" you
 have the advantage of me, Mrs.--  Surely not Mrs. Fawley, once Miss
 Donn, of the vicinity of Marygreen?"


---
you know. 
---
not as you think
---
," said Arabella dryly. 
---
" The
 lawyers untied us. 
---
" They SAY."


---
they are cousins
---
" Cousinship is a great convenience to their feelings
---
" Cousinship is a great convenience to their feelings, I should say? Shall we look at the pictures, too?"


---
The trio followed across the green and. 
---
they were exciting
---
it bore
---
They glanced cursorily at the pictures, and. 
---
When they had stood a little, and
---
the child came up on
 the other side. 
---
they were too deeply absorbed in their own lives,. 
---
whose movements had an unexpected fascination for
 her
---
as they stood
---
as they supposed,
---
" do you want anything
 such as this, Mrs. Cartlett? 
---
It is not compounded out of my regular
 pharmacopoeia, but
---
was
 used by the ancients with great effect
---
What is it made of
---
It took nearly a hundred hearts
."


---
I am sometimes asked for such a thing."  I found it out by study of
 their writings, and." How do you get pigeons enough?"

"
---
In a few
 hours the birds come to it from all points of the compass-- east,
 west, north, and south-- and
---
all this is told
 you
---
that you mean
---
You must keep faith with me?"


---
who had

---
you had enough of this business at home
---
" Surely you did n't come fifty miles from your own
 bar? 
---
, I get a piece of rock- salt, of which pigeons are
 inordinately fond, and place it in a dovecot on my roof.  thus I secure as many as I require.
 because I gather from your questions" Very well-- I do n't mind a bottle--." " I should think!" Dammy, one would think,
!"


---
you were a young bachelor
---
with nobody to look after but yourself
---
" But we agreed; and
---
what could I do but?"

" Well, now we have met,,
---
was.


---
it is against the rules
---
" The policeman will be down on us, and
---
Because you have come to the great Wessex Agricultural
 Show-- or?"


---
because WE have come
---
" You are always trying. 
---
me confess to all sorts of
 absurdities
---
that we have
 returned to Greek joyousness, and
---
what twenty- five centuries have taught
 the race since their time,
---
as one of your Christminster luminaries
 says... 
---
Because I am improving my mind, of course, by seeing
 all these steam- ploughs, and threshing- machines, and chaff- cutters,
 and cows, and pigs, and sheep. I feel There is one immediate shadow, however-- only one." 
---
what they were saying and
---
" But please do n't mind!--I ca n't help
 it. 
---
they'd be all withered in a few days
---
that the pair had hitherto led
---
The unnoticed lives began, from the
 day of the suspended wedding onwards,. 
---
The curious facts of a child coming to them
 unexpectedly,," and Sue" Mother," and a hitch
 in a marriage ceremony intended for quietness to be performed at a
 registrar's office, together with rumours of the undefended cases in
 the law- courts, bore only one translation to plain minds.


---
The result was. 
---
shortly after the attempt at the registrar's the
 pair went off-- to London
---
that it was believed-- for several days,
---
When they came back
---
they let and with total indifference and weariness
 of mien, that they were legally married at last. 
---
it be

---
who had

---
listless manner for days seemed
.


---
as it was called
---
their going away so secretly

---
But the mistake() of to do the business, kept up much of the mystery of their lives; and

---
they found. 
---
that they made not such advances with their neighbours
---
as
 they had expected
---
A living mystery was not much less
 interesting than a dead scandal.


---
who at first had used
---
when they came
---
the neighbouring artizans' wives looked straight along the
 pavement.


---
Nobody molested them
---
, it is true; but
---
an oppressive atmosphere began
. 
---
as if that visit had brought some evil influence
---
And their temperaments were precisely of a kind to suffer from
 this atmosphere, and. 
---
Their apparent attempt at reparation had come too
.


---
The headstone and epitaph orders fell off: and
---
when autumn came
---
The life suits us, certainly; but
---
if we could get
 away to a place where we are unknown
---
, we should be lighter hearted,
 and. 
---
And you have been keeping on this
 house and furniture entirely for me and the boy! 
---
You do n't want
 it yourself, and
---
the expense is unnecessary. 
---
whatever we do
---
wherever we go
---
We'll get nice lodgings,
. 
---
wherever we go
---
you to do that
---
you would n't,
---
There was a knock at the door, and
---
Biles and Willis, the building
 contractors, sent me."


---
if you'll undertake the relettering
 of the ten commandments in a little church they've been restoring
 lately in the country near here
---
" It is not a very artistic job,
---
" The
 clergyman is a very old- fashioned chap, and
---
anything more be done to the church than cleaning and repairing
---
who was sentimentally

---
" The Ten Commandments are fixed to the east end
---
," the messenger went
 on," and
---
they want,."


---
them carted off as old materials belonging to the
 contractor in the usual way of the trade
---
A bargain as to terms was struck, and
---
, you
 see
---
you
 can help in it--. 
---
at least you can try
---
We shall have all the church
 to ourselves,."


---
as the rest of the work is finished
---
what the contractor's clerk had said
---
that was true
---
The tables of the Jewish law towered sternly over the utensils of
 Christian grace, as the chief ornament of the chancel end, in the
 fine dry style of the last century. 
---
as their framework was
 constructed of ornamental plaster
---
And they could not be taken down for
 repair. 
---
crumbled by damp, required renewal
---
when
 this had been done, and
---
the whole cleansed
---
also because they liked.


---
Nobody seemed likely to disturb them; and
---
the
 pleasant twitter of birds, and rustle of October leafage, came in
 through an open window, and.


---
They were not, however,.

---
About half- past twelve there came footsteps on the gravel without.

---
what was being done
---
They passed on into an aisle, at which time the door
 again opened, and another figure entered-- a small one, that of little
 Time, who was crying. 
---
" I could n't stay, because they said--"

---
The child
 went into the churchyard, and
---
Meanwhile
 the door had opened again, and
---
Next came two ladies, and
---
after talking to the charwoman they
 also moved forward, and
---
They went back to where the others were standing, undertones: and
---
one said--
---
I suppose?" Some say Yes
---
: some say No,
---
to be, or somebody's-- that's very clear!"


---
" They've only been married a very few weeks, whether or no."


---
Biles and
 Willis could think of such a thing as hiring those
---
The churchwarden supposed.


---
that Biles and Willis knew of nothing
 wrong, and
---
then the other,,
 explained by calling them strange people
---
which followed
---
The probable drift of the subdued conversation was
 made plain by the churchwarden breaking into an anecdote, in a voice
, but
---
that everybody in the church could hear,:


---
though obviously suggested
 by the present situation
---
I wonder!"

" Well, now, it is a curious thing
---
my grandfather told me a
 strange tale of a most immoral case that happened at the painting of
 the Commandments in a church out by Gaymead-- which is quite within a
 walk of this one. 
---
In them days Commandments were mostly done in gilt
 letters on a black ground, and
---
that's. 
---
how they were out
---
before the owld church was rebuilded
---
It must have been somewhere
 about a hundred years ago, and
---
that them Commandments wanted
---
as ours do here
---
they had.

---
Now they wished, so

---
finished by a particular Sunday
---
There was no true religion
 in the country at that date,
---
'em
 have plenty of drink during the afternoon
---
As evening drawed on they

---
It got later and
 later, and
---
they got,. 
---
till at last they went
 and

---
No sooner had they tossed off their
 glasses than,
---
so the story goes
---
, they fell down senseless, one and
 all. 
---
How long they bode, but
---
so they did n't know
---
when they came
 to themselves
---
there was a terrible thunder- storm a- raging, and

---
they seemed. 
---
When it got daylight
---
they could see. 
---
that the work was really
 finished, and
---
could n't at all mind finishing it themselves
---
They
 went home, and
---
they heard
---
the next thing was. 
---
that a great scandal had
 been caused in the church
---
when the people
 came and
---
service began
---
that Sunday morning, for, all saw
---
where I say,
 that the Ten Commandments wez painted
 with the' nots' left out
---
Decent people would n't attend service
 there for a long time, and
---
the Bishop had reconsecrate the church. 
---
That's the tradition. 
---
You must take it for what it is wo'th, but
---
as I used this case
 to- day has reminded me,."


---
The visitors gave one more glance,. 
---
who had not
 stopped
---
what it is
---
that they, and everybody, should think people wicked

---
because they may have chosen
---
It is really
 these opinions that make the best intentioned people reckless, and

---
It was only a funny story.
---
" Ah, but we suggested it! 
---
such a story was certainly not very exhilarating,
 in a serious view of their position. 
---
that their position this morning had a ludicrous side,
 and
---
It is droll, after all
---
That's better
---
Now we are right again
---
" Oh but it is serious, all the same!"
---
" But do you see? 
---
they do n't think
---
we are
 married
---
They WON'T believe it! 
---
It is extraordinary!"


---
whether they think so or not
---
They sat down to lunch-- which they had brought with them not to
 hinder time-- and
---
" Here-- I've just had a complaint about this with rather
 breathless awkwardness. 
---
what was going on
---
It is
 best,. 
---
Then their eyes met.


---
" How could we be so simple!"
---
we might do this
---
Of course we ought not
---
Well, it ca n't be helped, dear
---
They sat down passively for a few minutes,.


---
-- Agnostics had scarcely
 been heard of at this time-- their one common wish to enlarge their
 minds forming a sufficiently close bond of union. 
---
The subscription
 was small, and the room homely; and
---
It was late
---
: all
 the others had come, and
---
Some
 ordinary business was transacted, and
---
it was disclosed. 
---
that the
 number of subscriptions had shown
---
One member-- a really well- meaning and upright man-- began
:
---
that it behoved
 them
---
for if the committee were
 not respected, and
---
speaking in enigmas about certain possible causes to look well into their constitution; had not at least, in their differences, a common
 standard of CONDUCT, they would bring the institution to the ground.

---
what this
 meant
---
Thus the supersensitive couple were. 
---
And then bills were sent in, and
---
the question arose,,
---
The day of the sale came on; and
---
It chanced
---
which
 could be emptied of its effects, and
---
that were not in
 the sale
---
with the child, and their few trunks,
 baskets, and bundles, and two chairs and a table, the two sat in meditative talk.


---
Footsteps began, the comers
 inspecting the goods, some of which were of so quaint and ancient a
 make as to acquire an adventitious value as art. 
---
Their door was

---
They soon found. 
---
that, instead of the furniture, their own personal
 histories and past conduct began
---
It was not till
 now. 
---
that they really discovered
---
what a fools' paradise of supposed
 unrecognition they had been living in of late
---
Time being a subject which formed a large ingredient in the hints and
 innuendoes
---
At length the auction began in the room below, whence

---
they could hear.


---
each familiar article knocked down, the highly prized
 ones cheaply, the unconsidered at an unexpected price
---
People do n't understand us
---
The question is, where to?"


---
" I am glad we have
."

"" It ought. 
---
There one can live as one chooses.
---
We should be unhappy there.
---
I know it well. " Why?"

" Ca n't you think?"

"?"


---
" That's the chief reason."


---
lest there should be
 some more of our late experience
---
Gothic is barbaric art, after
 all. 
---
Pugin was wrong, and
---
Wren was right. 
---
in which we looked
 in each other's faces
---
Under the picturesqueness of those Norman
 details one can see the grotesque childishness of uncouth people
,.
---
remembered by dim
 tradition only
---
-- you have
---
what you have said

---
But one can work, and. 
---
what one does
---
we could both follow an occupation in which personal
 circumstances do n't count
---
as you are for ecclesiastical art
---
You
 must fall back upon railway stations, bridges, theatres, music- halls,
 hotels-- everything that has no connection with conduct.
---
you know
---
But even a baker
 must be conventional,.
---
where people are gloriously indifferent to everything except the
 quality of the goods
---
Their thoughts were diverted by the voice of the auctioneer
---
That was my great- grandfather's
---
we could have

---
One by one the articles went, and
---
the afternoon passed away. 
---
after the
 conversation they had heard. 
---
they were shy of going out
---
while the
 purchasers were in their line of retreat
---
However, the later lots
 drew on, and
---
it became necessary.


---
The impending sale of these birds had been the most trying suspense
 of the whole afternoon. 
---
when it was found

---
that they could not possibly be kept
---
, more sadness was caused than by
 parting from all the furniture. 
---
at which they were finally

---
The purchaser was a neighbouring poulterer, and
---
they
 were unquestionably doomed.


---
it was time
 to go and see if the lodgings were ready
---
the coast being clear, and
---
, assisted by the growing dusk of
 evening,
---
An emotion at sight of them caused, and
---
The cover was lifted from within, and
---
the pigeons flew
 away with a clatter that brought the chagrined poulterer cursing and
 swearing to the door.


---
" Do the buyers pay?"
---
before they bring away
 the things
---
" It was so foolish of me! 
---
Oh why should Nature's law be mutual
 butchery!"


---
" Is it so, Mother?
---
" Well, they must take their chance, now, poor things
---
as the sale- account is wound up
---
As soon, and our bills paid
---
", we go."


---
" Where do we go to?".


---
" We must sail under sealed orders,
---
that nobody may trace us... 
---
We
 must n't go to Alfredston, or to Melchester, or to Shaston, or to
 Christminster. 
---
we may go anywhere
---
" Why must n't we go there, Father?"

" Because of a cloud that has gathered over us;!' 
---
' we have

---
Though perhaps
 we have' done that.'"



 VII



---
which was right in our own eyes
---
they had gone
---
nobody knew, chiefly. 
---
because nobody cared

---
Any one sufficiently curious to trace the steps of such
 an obscure pair might have discovered without great trouble.


---
which was not without its
 pleasantness for a time
---
till it was finished
---
a half passed thus. 
---
who there encountered each other
---
It was the spring fair at Kennetbridge, and,
---
though this ancient
 trade- meeting had much dwindled from its dimensions of former times
---
,
 the long straight street of the borough presented a lively scene
 about midday. 
---
At this hour a light trap, among other vehicles,
 was driven into the town by the north road, and up to the door of
 a temperance inn. 
---
where it is,
---
we'll go
 in and. 
---
and then I'll come back, and; and I begin." With all my heart," said the other. 
---
You ca n't get much at these
 temperance houses.
---
Though I would sooner have
" Now, do n't you give way to gluttonous desires, my child
---
" This is the proper place. 
---
Very well:
 we'll meet in half an hour,
---
unless you come with me
---
where
 the site of the new chapel is?"


---
You can tell me."


---
It was covered with an immaculate cloth, and

---
How are you, Mrs. Cartlett?
---
" What?-- you have
---
But whatever
 profit there is in public- house keeping
---
that brew the
 liquors, and not to them
---
You do n't know me
---
you was n't
---
," replied Father Time, who had learned to use the
 Wessex tongue quite naturally by now.


---
there's another train coming in
---
-- that's all.

---
I am surprised." It is only a temporary occupation-- a fancy of ours while we are in a
 difficulty."


---
another coming soon
---
-- what is there? 
---
Some
 folks would be proud enough!"


---
" Two."

" And another coming soon, I see."

-- I mean" It is not--
---
not as you think! 
---
that I am ashamed But it seems
 such a terribly tragic thing to bring beings into the world-- so
 presumptuous-- that I question my right to do it sometimes!"


---
But you do n't tell me? 
---
why you do such a
 thing as this
---
it has been a long, weary time! 
---
We have had an old
 widow friend with us; but
---
Why did you choose?
---
We call them Christminster cakes.

---
They are a great success."


---
Why, they are windows and towers, and
 pinnacles! 
---
And upon my word they are very nice.
---
They are reminiscences of the Christminster Colleges.

---
Traceried windows, and cloisters, you see. 
---
" Do n't you think? 
---
; you do,
---
" Why do n't you go back to
 school- keeping?"


---
" They wo n't have me."


---
And there is no reason to wish it. 
---
We
 gave up all ambition, and."


---
" Where are you living?"


---
" You need n't throw that in my face!"
---
you must have enough
 of your own
---
You should try
---
"," replied the widow, from the serene heights of a
 soul conscious not only of spiritual but of social superiority.

---
you know
---
There's, and

---
laid this afternoon by a popular London preacher
---
who peeped through the opening
---
Those saw a crowd of
 persons in broadcloth, with hymn- books in their hands, standing round
 the excavations for the new chapel- walls.
---
It was two hours later on the same day that Anny and Mrs. Cartlett,
 having had tea at the Temperance Hotel,. 
---
which stretches between
 Kennetbridge and Alfredston
---
as Anny at first surmised
---
" I make no boast of my awakening, but I'm not what I was.  After
 Cartlett's death I was passing the chapel in the street next ours,
 and.  I felt a need
 of some sort of support under my loss, and, as' twas righter than
 gin, I took to going there regular, and.
 But I've left London now,, and at present I am living at
 Alfredston, with my friend Anny,.  I'm
 I drove over with Anny.  Now I must go back."

" No-- it is something else,"
---
they've begun this afternoon. 
---
But something has happened. 
---
" I do.  But my wicked heart will ramble off in spite of myself!"


---
what it is
---
If
 you on'y knew
---
" Well-- I know what I do dream sometimes o' nights quite against my
 wishes, you'd say!" 
---
( Anny, too, had grown rather
 serious of
---
After all
 that's said about the comforts of this religion
---
when it afflicts
 volupshious widows
---
that another good thing for it,, is
---
while a- bowed down
---
They drove in silence along the straight road. 
---
till they were within
 the horizon of Marygreen, which lay not far to the left of their
 route
---
They came to the junction of the highway and the cross- lane
 leading to that village, whose church- tower could be seen athwart the
 hollow. 
---
When they got yet farther on, and
---
Feelings are feelings! 
---
You be excited, dear! 
---
Now you come along home quiet, and

---
us talk about un no more
---
We wo n't
 come out this road again,, because it
 inflames' ee so. 
---
they crossed the
 ridge- way. 
---
When they began
---
to descend the long, straight hill, they
 saw. 
---
The remainder of the journey was down- hill, and
---
The wayfarer faced round and. 
---
when you used
---
because we had only a mistress down at our
 place, and
---
you taught better
---
But you would n't remember me?--
---
as I
 should you
---
no doubt you were then."


---
You know
---
as you did yours
---
all went pretty straight
---
But you-- you were decidedly wrong!
---
, did you not?"


---
" You are keeping the school there again, just as formerly?"


---
It was
 a last resource-- a small thing to return to after my move upwards,
 and my long indulged hopes-- a returning to zero, with all its
 humiliations. 
---
But it is a refuge. 
---
when all other schools were closed against
 me
---
" Right you are. 
---
A contented mind is a continual feast. 
---
you mean?
---
the harm
 you did yourself by dirting your own nest serves you right, excusing
 the liberty."


---
They did not even defend the case!"


---
" That was. 
---
because they did n't care to
---
worried by the information
---
We all do! 
---
Custom does it! 
---
It's all the same
 in the end! 
---
_ should n't
 have let! 
---
Besides,
 you've got the laws on your side. 
---
Moses knew. 
---
Do n't you call to

---
when they read
 it in church
---
we must grin and! 
---
" Cruelty is the law
 pervading all nature and society; and
---
we ca n't get out of it!"


---
if we
 would
---
you forget
---
They had now reached the low levels bordering Alfredston, and passing
 through the outskirts
---
approached a mill,; whereupon they drew up, and
---
which had begun
---
They followed a lane to a distance of half a
 mile,.


---
Before you are

---
They turned, and. 
---
Into one of these they entered by lifting the latch
 without knocking, and. 
---
" What-- you have sold them all?"
---
when they were left
 alone
---
It is only a little over a dozen miles across the country to
 Alfredston. 
---
" perhaps it is for the best that we have almost
 decided to move on. 
---
Then Mrs. Edlin can go home
 again-- dear faithful old soul-- the only friend we have in the world!"


---
" Where do you think?" 
---
Why should they care? 
---
if they were known
---
It was
 oversensitive of them. 
---
They could go on selling
 cakes there, for that matter,. 
---
" Why should you care so much for Christminster?"
---
" Christminster cares nothing for you, poor dear!"


---
-- the so- called self- taught-- how it
 scorns our laboured acquisitions,
---
when it should be the first
 to respect them
---
how it sneers at our false quantities and
 mispronunciations
---
when it should say
---
you want help
---
Nevertheless, it is the centre of the universe to me,
 because of my early dream: and
---
nothing can alter it. 
---
Perhaps it will
 soon wake up, and. 
---
It will then be June, and
---
that
 in three weeks they had arrived in the city of many memories
---
" There are two who decline, a woman and I,
       And."
                               
---
who bore a remarkable family likeness to their
 welcomers, and
---
who were dressed up in the brightest and lightest of
 raiment
---
The place seems gay
---
" Why-- it is Remembrance
 Day!--Jude--
---
how sly of you-- you came to- day on purpose!
---
we might as well come to- day as on any other
---
it interfere with our business
---
we have a good
 deal to do before we shall be settled here. 
---
The first thing is
 lodgings."


---
they proceeded

---
Reaching the Fourways they were about to turn
 off to where accommodation was likely to be found. 
---
us go and
---
We can get them
 afterwards."


---
Ought n't we?
---
together they went
 down Chief Street,. 
---
who had known no college in their youth
---
Crowds of pretty sisters in airy costumes, and meekly
 ignorant parents, were under
 convoy in the same direction by brothers and sons bearing the opinion
 written large on them.


---
that no properly qualified human beings had

---
till they came
---
My failure is reflected on me by every one of those young
 fellows
---
" A lesson on presumption is awaiting me
 to- day!--Humiliation Day for me!... 
---
If you, my dear darling, had n't
 come to my rescue
---
" It would have been better, dear
---
if we
 had gone at once about our own affairs
---
" Well-- we are near
---
; we will see it now
---
They turned in on the left by the church with the Italian porch,
.


---
whose helical columns were heavily draped with creepers, and
---
A passage was
 kept clear through their midst by two barriers of timber,.


---
" Here is the place
---
-- they are just going!"
---
The sky had grown overcast and livid, and
---
thunder rumbled
 now and then.


---
Father Time shuddered. 
---
" It do seem like the Judgment Day!"
---
They are only learned Doctors
---
While they waited big drops of rain
---
the delay grew tedious. 
---
They wo n't be long now
---
But the procession did not come forth, and
---
somebody in the crowd, to
 pass the time,.

---
what was meant by the Latin inscription in its midst
---
who stood near the inquirer
---
The idle crowd, including the two policemen at the doors, stared like
 the Lycaonians at Paul,, and
---
they seemed
---
how the stranger
 should know more about the buildings of their town
---
than they
 themselves did
---
to wonder; till one of them said:"--
---
Do n't you mind

---
; Tinker Taylor was seen to
. 
---
" An' you do n't seem?"


---
This came in a new voice, and

---
" But Fortune did n't lie that way?". 
---
" Yer powers was n't
 enough to carry' ee through?"


---
that my failure proved my view to be a
 wrong one, or
---
that my success would have made it a right one
---
; though
 that's--
---
how we appraise such attempts nowadays
---
that
 we saw by now
---
.

" I do n't think I like Christminster!" I tried, and I
 failed.  But I do n't admit I mean, If I had
 ended by becoming like one of these gentlemen in red and black dropping in here, everybody would have said:'!' 
---
than I began they say:'
---
" However it was my poverty and not my will
---
that consented
---
It takes two or three generations; and
---
perhaps they should be
 called
---
You may
 ridicule me
---
if you knew
---
you would rather pity me
---
if they knew
---
arriving--"it is just possible they would do the same."


---
, it is true!"
---
" You were n't that. 
---
You struggled nobly to
 acquire knowledge, and
---
only the meanest souls in the world would
 blame you!"


---
they dropped
 away one by one; and
---
since you wanted to

---
There, gentlemen, know
---
may it do you!

---
there is something wrong
 somewhere in our social formulas
---
what it is
---
if, indeed, they ever
 discover it-- at least in our time
---
who knoweth
---
'"

" Hear, hear," said the populace.


---
" Well preached!" said Tinker Taylor. 
---
that takes the services
---
when our head reverends
---
I'll take my oath not one o''em would! 
---
had it wrote down for' n.  And this only a working- man!"


---
whose
 horse failed
---
who jumped out and
---
The driver, alighting,
 began.


---
If that can be done
---
, what shall we say as to

---
how far we've got
---
" Order!" said one of the policemen, who had been engaged with a
 comrade in opening the large doors opposite the college. 
---
while the procession passes
---
The rain came on
 more heavily, and
---
who had umbrellas
---
all opened them. 
---
us go on, dear
---
" We have n't any lodgings yet, and; and
---
all our things are at the
 station
---
you are by no means well yet. 
---
I am afraid this wet will
 hurt you!"

" They are coming now. 
---
A peal of six bells struck out,
---
human faces began, and
---
the procession of heads of houses and new Doctors
 emerged,.


---
As they went
---
their names were called by knowing informants, and
---
when
 they reached the old round theatre of Wren.


---
a cheer rose high
---
's go that way
---
though it now rained steadily

---
and I'll go!"; the windows
 are open."


---
But what
 made so? 
---
you tremble
---
when we were at the barrier
---
And how pale you
 are, Sue!"


---
" Ah-- did you!"


---
you speaking to the crowd
---
it is all right
 with our plans
---
It comes over me at times like a
 sort of creeping paralysis, and!"


---
" You are getting tired, Sue. 
---
Yes, we'll go
 on at once."


---
They started in quest of the lodging, and
---
it was not so fascinating-- a narrow lane
 close to the back of a college, but
---
The little houses were darkened to gloom by the high collegiate
 buildings,;

---
within which life was
---
as if it had been on opposite sides of the globe
---
yet only a thickness of wall divided them. 
---
Two or three of the
 houses had notices of rooms, and
---
" Why the bells-- what church can that be? 
---
The tones are familiar."


---
Another peal of bells had begun.


---
" said the landlady tartly. 
---
" Did you knock?
---
We have n't any

---
me try
---
You do n't know the way."


---
They found a second place hard by; but
---
The small child squared its mouth and. 
---
that trouble loomed
---
" Are the great old houses gaols?"


---
Now we'll try again
---
Leaving Kennetbridge for this place is like coming from
 Caiaphas to Pilate!... 
---
" Nobody would notice it now
---
There was one other house, and
---
they tried a third time. 
---
they perforce
---
This arrangement adopted, in the stress
 from delaying their search till so late. 
---
But they
 could not afford; and
---
that the window
 commanded the back of another of the colleges
---
, they had literally not found the courage
 to repeat it, though they had attempted it two or three times.

---
The housewife looked embarrassed, and. 
---
The hall and stairs fresh painted, to be kicked about by
 them! 
---
You must have known. 
---
all was not straight with' em--
---
as it seemed
---
you have
 the room for the week after all
---
as
 it is getting late in the afternoon
---
if you can
 leave early in the morning
---
When the landlady had

---
that the rain had
 ceased
---
that, after putting the little ones
 to bed, they should go out and, and

---
as
 they had been that day
---
nobody to promise her a room for the
 following day
---
the house being little
 more than an old intramural cottage,
---
The outlines of Rubric College also were discernible beyond the
 other, and the tower of a third farther off still. 
---
Then it would n't matter so much! 
---
" It would n't!"


---
" No!  All is trouble, adversity, and suffering!"


---
" Partly."

" It would be better,?"


---
would n't it
---
" It would almost, dear."

"'?"


---
Tis because of us children, too, is n't it,
---
that you ca n't get a
 good lodging
---
" Well-- people do to children sometimes."


---
if children make so much trouble
---
" Then, why do people have' em?"


---
because it is a law of nature
---
" But we do n't ask?"


---
" And what makes it worse with me
---
is. 
---
you need n't have had me
---
unless you liked
---
to have
 come to' ee-- that's the real truth! 
---
" You could n't help it, my dear."


---
whenever children be born
---
that that are not wanted
---
they
 should be killed directly,
---
before their souls come to'em, and
---
as circumstances permitted
---
" There is going
---
" There is going."


---
what you've got
---
Oh you do n't care
---
", you do n't care!"
---
when you need n't have done it
---
till we was better
 off
---
we turned out to- morrow
---
yet you be going!... 
---
' Tis done o'
 purpose!--'tis--'tis!" 
---
" Y- you must forgive me, little Jude!"
---
when you are
 older
---
It does seem--
---
, now we are in
 these difficulties! 
---
But it-- is not quite on
 purpose
---
Yes it is
---
"-- it must be! 
---
For nobody would interfere with us, like
 that,! 
---
unless you agreed
---
you care for me, or Father, or any of us any more
---
in which
 a bed had been spread on the floor
---
If we
 children was gone
---
there'd be no trouble at all
---
that, dear go to
 sleep
---
what had happened before

---
who,, must be fatigued by their exertions of yesterday
---
Somehow, now it was morning,
---
the request to leave the lodgings
 did not seem such a depressing incident, nor. 
---
as it had seemed the night
 before
---
that it would not be worth

---
" You must all come to this inn for a day or two
---
" It is
 a rough place, and
---
it will not be so nice for the children, but
---
we
 shall have more time to look round. 
---
There are plenty of lodgings in
 the suburbs-- in my old quarter of Beersheba. 
---
now you are here, my bird. 
---
You are sure you are well? 
---
There will
 be plenty of time to get back and prepare the children's meal before
 they wake. 
---
that all was quiet in the children's room, and
---
This was perfunctorily done, and

---
it being now about half- past
 eight o'clock.


---
which had seemed
---
that the door of the room, or rather
 closet-- to go heavily upon its hinges-- was open, and
---
; no children were there. 
---
Half- paralyzed by the strange and consummate horror of the scene
---
the feel of their bodies in the momentary
 handling seemed. 
---
that they were dead
---
The nearest surgeon came in, but,
---
The children were past
 saving,
---
for though their bodies were still barely cold
---
it was

---
that they had been hanging more than an hour
---
held by the parents later on
---
when they were able to
 reason on the case
---
The
 probability,, was. 
---
because we are too menny
---
They could hear from this chamber and

---
the people moving about above,
---
if there were any hope
---
that it was necessary
---
there was no hope
---
The Doctor says
. 
---
They seem
. 
---
before they are old enough to have staying
 power to resist them
---
it is the beginning of the coming
 universal wish not to live
---
When
 everybody was gone
---
When the house was silent, and
---
they could do nothing but
---
await the
 coroner's inquest, a subdued, large, low voice spread into the air of
 the room from behind the heavy walls at the back.


---
" What is it?"
---
It's the anthem from the seventy- third Psalm;'.'
---
Truly God is loving
 unto Israel
---
They had done no harm! 
---
Why
 should they have been taken away, and not I!"


---
There was another stillness-- broken at last by two persons in
 conversation somewhere without.


---
" They are talking about us, no doubt!"
---
-- they are not talking of us
---
" They
 are two clergymen of different views,. 
---
" There is something external to us which says,' You
 sha n't!' 
---
First it said,'!' 
---
You sha n't learn
---
Then it said,'!' 
---
You
 sha n't labour
---
Now it says,'!'
---
You sha n't love
---
That's bitter of you,
---
" But it's true!"


---
Thus they waited, and
---
them lie
---
" Why do n't you speak to me, Jude?"
---
" Shadowed by death
---
-- that's all."


---
as one should only talk to people of
 mature age
---
the world was against us,
---
that it was better to

---
" Why did you do it, Sue?"


---
It was. 
---
so that I could neither conceal things
 nor" Your plan might have been a good one for the majority of cases
---
; only
 in our peculiar case it chanced. 
---
my baby darling a new frock
---
My eyes are
 so swollen that I can scarcely see; and yet little more than a year

---
We went about loving each other too
 much-- indulging ourselves to utter selfishness with each other! 
---
We
 said--
---
do you remember?--. 
---
that we would make a virtue of joy
---
it was Nature's intention, Nature's law and
---
which
 civilization had taken upon itself
---
It is best,
 perhaps,
---
that they should be gone
---
it is
---
that
 they should be plucked fresh
---
" Some say."


---
that the elders should rejoice
---
when
 their children die in infancy
---
" But they do n't know!... 
---
Oh my babies, my babies, could you be
 alive now! 
---
You may say
---
It was not unreasonable
---
What ought?
---
Nothing can be done
---
" Things are, and."


---
as they are
---
Who said that?
---
" It comes in the chorus of the_ Agamemnon_. 
---
It has been in my mind
.
---
continually since this happened
---
" My poor Jude-- how you've missed everything!--you more than I,! 
---
you should know that by your unassisted
 reading, and yet be in poverty and despair
---
The jury duly came and,
---
the inquest was held; and

---
the newspapers had brought to the spot curious idlers, who stood
 apparently counting the window- panes and the stones of the walls.

---
Doubt of the real relations of the couple added zest to their
 curiosity. 
---
the
 coffins were quietly carried out of the house. 
---
they agreed.


---
if any
 objection to it arose from the tragedy which had occurred there
---
that they
 would try
---
its number changed
---
who had followed to
 the spot by reason of the tragedy
---
The idlers were all gone now. 
---
whose coloured
 clothing,, suggested to the eye a deeper grief than the conventional
 garb of bereavement could express
---
them be taken away
---
You said perhaps; and
---
then you
 did n't, but! 
---
Oh Jude, you are cruel to me too!"


---
me to dig out the grave again
---
that there'll be
 another soon
---
It would not
 take long! 
---
if you will let me
---
But it could
 do no good, and; and
---
that it
 was imperative
---
economy being so
 imperative
---
they walked along slowly,
 Jude in black crape, she in brown and red clothing
---
They were to
, but
---
that it was
 not practicable, and in course of time they entered the now hated
 house. 
---
the Doctor sent for.


---
that a child had been prematurely
 born, and
---
that it, like the others, was a corpse
---
They were in other lodgings
 now, in the direction of Beersheba, and not far from the Church of
 Ceremonies-- Saint Silas.


---
They would sit silent, more bodeful of the direct antagonism of
 things than of their insensate and stolid obstructiveness. 
---
that the world resembled a stanza or melody
 composed in a dream
---
; it was wonderfully excellent to the half- aroused
 intelligence, but hopelessly absurd at the full waking
---
that the
 First Cause worked automatically like a somnambulist, and not
 reflectively like a sage
---
;; that at the framing of the terrestrial
 conditions there seemed. 
---
as that reached by thinking and
 educated humanity
---
But affliction makes opposing forces loom
 anthropomorphous; and
---
" We must conform!"
---
we must submit. 
---
There is no choice. 
---
We must. 
---
It is no use fighting
 against God!"


---
whoever or whatever our foe
 may be
---
But, I am cowed into submission. 
---
" What shall we do? 
---
You are in work now; but
---
it may
 only be
---
because our history and relations are not absolutely
 known
---
if they knew our marriage
---
they
 would turn you out of your job
---
as they did at Aldbrickham
---
Perhaps they would hardly do that. 
---
that we ought
---
as you are able to go
 out
---
" You think?"

"
---
we ought
---
shunned by the
 virtuous
---
It amazes me!

---
if any other of them are the same purblind, simple creatures as
 I
---
Yes, Sue-- that's. 
---
You were a
 distinct type-- a refined creature, intended by Nature to be left
 intact. 
---
what you are not
---
If anybody is
---
to blame it is I."


---
you go
---
As to ourselves, the fact of our not
 having entered into a legal contract is the saving feature in our
 union. 
---
We have thereby avoided,.
---
as it were, the solemnity
 of our first marriages
---
Only the thought comes to me."


---
" It is your weakness-- a sick fancy, without reason or meaning!

---
it trouble you
---
as these there had come

---
which earlier in
 their experience would have made them cheerful
---
People seemed, and
---
What are you thinking of, little woman?
---
that we have been selfish,
 careless, even impious, in our courses, you and I. 
---
Our life has been
 a vain attempt at self- delight. 
---
But self- abnegation is the higher
 road. 
---
We should mortify the flesh-- the terrible flesh-- the curse of
 Adam!"


---
" What has come over you?"


---
" We ought! 
---
what has pleased me
---
something would take the
 evil right out of me
---
my own too suffering
---
Your
 natural instincts are perfectly healthy;. 
---
We have not been selfish, except when no
 one could profit by our being otherwise. 
---
You used
---
that human
 nature was noble and long- suffering, not vile and corrupt, and
---
you spoke truly
---
And now you seem!"


---
as I
 have often said at
 last I thought. " I want a humble heart; and a chastened mind; and I have never had
 them yet!"

" You have been fearless, both as a thinker and as a feeler, and
---
you
 deserved more admiration than I gave. 
---
that's
 everything! 
---
" It is bereavement that has brought you to this!

---
I was too full of narrow
 dogmas at that time. I wish my every fearless word and thought
 could be rooted out of my history.  I can not humiliate myself too much.  I should like to
 prick myself all over with pins and bleed out the badness that's in
 me!"

 Such remorse is not for you, my sensitive plant, but for the wicked
 ones of the earth-- who never feel it!"


---
" It is indulgence."


---
But is there anything better on earth than
 that we should love one another?"


---
It depends on the sort of love; and
---
yours-- ours-- is the
 wrong."


---
when do you wish
---
our marriage to be

---
Several minutes elapsed, and
---
" There is a strange, indescribable perfume or atmosphere about you
 to- night
---
A sort of vegetable scent, which to know, yet
 can not remember."


---
" It is incense."


---
You go there!"


---
" You see,
---
Jude, it is lonely here in the weekday mornings,, and
---
when you
 are at work
---
as it is so near
---
Only it is odd, for
 you. 
---
They little think!"


---
what sort of chiel is
---
What do you mean
---
" How can you pain me so, dear Jude, in my trouble! 
---
But you ought.
---
You wo n't be angry
---
,
 will you? 
---
since my babies died
---
But you ARE!"


---
" From your point of view; but--"

" Of course we were afraid of the ceremony, and a good many others
.

---
But experience has proved; and
---
how we misjudged ourselves, and
---
if you are beginning,
---
as you seem
---
you do n't say
---
it shall be

---
What do you mean by what you said?
---
we HAD gone through the ceremony
---
Would you feel
?"


---
that you were then
---
that's perverse
---
" Ah-- you hinted that absurd fancy to me before!"


---
" It was only an impression with me then
---
as time goes on that
---
how we are changing places
---
Some few days later, in the dusk of the summer evening, they were
 sitting in the same small room downstairs,. 
---
when a knock came to the
 front door of the carpenter's house where they were lodging, and
---
in a
 few moments there was a tap at the door of their room
---
Before they
 could open it
---
the comer did so, and
---
Yet something seemed.


---
three attempted
---
who, seeming utterly unable to reach the ideal of
 a catastrophic manner,
---
As' tis your trade, Jude, you'll be able to put up
 a handsome stone to' em."


---
We all did.
---
that were n't mine
---
," continued Mrs. Cartlett.

---
" Perhaps' twouldn't have happened then! 
---
you
 were
---
all except their
 obvious meaning was, naturally,
---
The latter,
 after evincing recovered
 herself, and
---
Well, my time is up. 
---
-- what do you call it-- in the hot weather, and
---
that should accord with the highest respectability
---
There was no answer, and
---
who kept the lodgings
---
the carpenter said. 
---
" It is shut."


---
The spot was
 deserted, but
---
the door was certainly unfastened
---
The prevalent silence seemed. 
---
which came from the other
 end of the building
---
as the original
 it was designed
---
It seemed
---
to be suspended in the
 air by invisible wires
---
; it was set with large jewels, which faintly
 glimmered in some weak ray caught from outside, as the cross swayed
 to and fro in a silent and scarcely perceptible motion. 
---
Underneath,
 upon the floor, lay, and

---
what appeared
---
Something white disclosed itself
---
" What-- do you want with me here, Jude?
---
" You should n't come! 
---
Why did you intrude
 here?
---
" How can you ask!"
---
Who has a right to come
---
who love you better than my own self-- better-- far
 better-- than you have loved me
---
What made?"


---
you leave me
---
You must take me. 
---
" But they are nothing to us!"


---
" Yes, dear friend, they are. 
---
My
 babies have been taken from me! 
---
" This is terrible!". 
---
" It is monstrous
 and unnatural for you to be so remorseful when you have done no
 wrong!"


---
" Ah-- you do n't know my badness!"


---
You make
. 
---
me hate Christianity, or mysticism, or Sacerdotalism, or whatever it
 may be called,
---
if it's that
---
which has caused this deterioration in
 you
---
whose soul shone like
 a diamond-- whom all the wise of the world would have been proud of,

---
if they could have known you
---
" You are angry, Jude, and unkind to me, and do n't see how things
 are."


---
you, too, are unhinged just now." 
---
Nothing can
 alter it!"


---
if ever two people were in this
 world
---
Nature's own marriage it is, unquestionably!"


---
Another was made for me there, and."


---
" Sue, Sue-- affliction has brought you to this unreasonable state!

---
you have formerly said through sentiment merely
---
You root out of me
---
in you is your extraordinary blindness now to your old logic. 
---
Is it
 peculiar to you, or
---
a fraction always wanting its integer? 
---
How you
 argued! 
---
that marriage was only a clumsy contract-- which it is-- how you
 showed all the objections to it-- all the absurdities
---
If two and two
 made four
---
when we were happy together
---
, surely they make four now? 
---
what little affection and reverence I had left in
 me for the Church as an old acquaintance...  What I ca n't understand
 I
 ca n't understand it, I repeat!"

" Ah, dear Jude; that's. 
---
You say'? 
---
are they

---
Nothing is there.' 
---
But something is."


---
" That is; and not a true parallel! 
---
You threw
 off old husks of prejudices, and; and
---
now you go
 back upon yourself. 
---
I confess I am utterly stultified in my estimate
 of you." Dear friend, my only friend, do n't be hard with me! 
---
They walked along a few more steps and
---
till they were outside the
 building
---
Where are dear Apollo, and dear Venus now!"


---
Do n't satirize me: it cuts like a knife!"


---
They went on."
---
till they
 came to a little coffee- house
---
" would you mind?
---
But do you? 
---
me go to our door
 and
---
Do n't we live here?
---
" You said!"


---
you would do
---
Perhaps it was wrong of me! 
---
Perhaps as we could n't conscientiously
 marry at first in the old- fashioned way, we ought.

---
Perhaps the world is not illuminated enough for such experiments as
 ours! 
---
Who were we,!"


---
we could act as pioneers
---
as I wished distastefully as I have done" I am so glad you see that much, at any rate.  I never deliberately
 meant as I did.  I slipped into my false position through
 jealousy and agitation!"

" But surely through love-- you loved me?"


---
it stop there
---
We ought.
---
as you will
---
But human nature ca n't help
.
---
" I was the unhappy cause of the change, as I have said
 before!... " Oh yes-- that's just what it has to learn-- self- mastery."


---
if either were
---
" I repeat-- to blame it was not you but
---
-- it was I. 
---
Mine was not the reciprocal wish till envy
. 
---
you approach me--
---
that it was damnably selfish
---
us say any more about it
---
Jude, will you leave me to
 myself now?
---
as you are
---
You have never loved me

---
Yours is not a passionate heart--
---
your
 heart does not burn in a flame! 
---
as I love you You are, upon the whole, a sort of
 fay, or sprite-- not a woman!"


---
you I merely wanted. 
---
you to love me
---
how it was
---
you go
---
But you see,"


---
however fondly
 it ended
---
, it began in the selfish and cruel wish to make your heart
 ache for me without letting mine ache for you.
---
You have been my social
 salvation. 
---
You know. 
---
you know
---
They have been kept entirely at a distance
! 
---
if you leave me
---
" Oh, but you must not, Jude! 
---
You wo n't!

---
God knows, about you at that time
---
And this one
 is not that, anyhow!"


---
As it has been so many
 times-- O Sue, my wife, why not?"


---
-- don't tempt me back
!"


---
the veil of our temple be rent in two from this hour
---
You do n't see!"
---
that it is a matter of conscience with me, and not
 of dislike to you
---
-- it breaks my heart
---
-- it will be undoing all I
 have begun! 
---
" Oh but you shall kiss me!"
---
they remained in silence Good- bye,
 good- bye!"
---
wo n't we? 
---
And we'll see each other sometimes
---
-- yes!--and forget
 all this, and?"


---
as we were long ago
---
IV


 The man, lived still at Marygreen.


---
as they stood in the rain at Christminster
---
" What are you thinking of?. 
---
" said Gillingham,
---
as they went home
---
you never obtained?
---
" No, no," said Phillotson gruffly. 
---
as you did see
 her
---
" I did n't wish.  But,, you should have said:'?'
---
How d'ye do
---
, my dear- that- was
---
But what do you think of this
---
Awkward, is n't it?"


---
That's a cheap sneer. 
---
it was stated
---
However, there was no doubt that the
 newspaper report was in some way true.


---
" Their cup of sorrow is now full!"
---
the schoolmaster
 coming to market there every Saturday
---
You like walking out this way, Mrs. Cartlett?
---
" It is as maid and wife, and
---
that are
 interesting to my feelings
---
all the past things of my life are. 
---
And they
 have been stirred up in me too, lately;
---
How do they bear their terrible affliction?
---
things were drifting that way from their manner
---
'em hurry up
---
the thing done
 legally
---
, only hers is of a more' sterical sort
 than mine. 
---
Separated, have they!"


---
You see
---
" Yes, poor little fellow-- born in lawful wedlock, thank God. 
---
we ca n't live in
 such a hum- drum place as this. 
---
They parted. 
---
" What is, or?"


---
where the pollard willows begin

---
which could be subverted by feeling in one direction
---
Principles were
 liable to the same catastrophe in another. 
---
which had
 allowed
---
But artifice was necessary
---
And here were the materials
 ready made. 
---
Gillingham replied, naturally,
---
it were best to

---
Probably,, the singular pair would make their union legal in
 course of time, and
---
all would be well, and decent, and in order.


---
" But they won't--
---
" Gillingham is so matter of fact. 
---
They are not
 mine; but
---
whether is true or no
---
to do this, there had not been much reason for writing to the latter at
 all. 
---
It was necessary,; and.


---
if you wished
---
crude loving kindness take
 care of itself
---
It was evening--
---
" Will you come out with me? 
---
that these words came
---
" It is dreary
---
for you to be out
---
if you prefer
---
they proceeded through the fog like Acherontic
 shades for a long while, without sound or gesture.


---
That is for form's sake, and
---
which does not see things
---
as they are
---
Nothing has changed that."


---
Yes, you are. 
---
You know it. 
---
you
 loved me; and
---
we closed with each other; and
---
that made the marriage.

---
We still love-- you as well as I--
---
Therefore our
 marriage is not cancelled."


---
how you see it
---
as it would
 be called by you
---
Strictly speaking you, too-- don't mind my saying

---
it, Jude!--you should take back-- Arabella."


---
But how if you and I had married
 legally,?"


---
as we were on the point of doing
---
that ours was not a marriage.

---
But' the world and its ways have a certain worth'( I
 suppose)
---
who is trying
---
The once
 keen vision was dimmed. 
---
It drives me out of my senses. 
---
You know
---
you do n't! 
---
It will be a fanatic
 prostitution
---
-- God forgive me, yes--
---
that's!"


---
what it will be
---
It seemed.


---
you know the whole truth
---
" that you might
 not consider
---
yourself slighted by hearing of it at second hand
---
you would be so rough with me for doing so
---
if you would
---
you
 wo n't
---
We are."


---
No sooner does one expect, as the
 one rational proceeding, than you double round the corner!"


---
you to go straight on
---
that go
---
you to go to the cemetery with me
---
our farewell be there-- beside
 the graves of those who died to bring home to me the error of my
 views
---
They turned in the direction of the place, and
---
the gate was opened to
 them on application. 
---
They reached it, and.


---
It is here
---
" So be it!"


---
Your
 generous devotion to me is unparalleled, Jude! 
---
if you have failed
---
Your worldly failure,
, is to your credit rather than to your blame.

---
that the best and greatest among mankind are those who do
 themselves no worldly good
---
" In that chapter we are at one, ever beloved darling, and
---
on it we'll
 part friends. 
---
Its verses will stand fast when all the rest that you
 call religion has passed away!"


---
" Well-- don't discuss it. 
---
The next afternoon the familiar Christminster fog still hung over all
 things. 
---
It was Friday evening,. 
---
which had been chosen
---
because the schoolmaster
 was disengaged at four o'clock that day till the Monday morning
 following
---
though it had been spoken advisedly
 without fervour
---
" My children-- are dead-- and
---
it is right that they should be! 
---
They were. 
---
They were sacrificed! 
---
Their death was the first stage of my purification.

---
That's!... 
---
why they have not died in vain
---
I am
 glad-- almost.  You will take me back?"


---
" You still
 have an aversion to me!"


---
" When are
 we going? 
---
if you really wish
---
you are
---
it will bring our lives to
 a triumphant and satisfactory issue
---
But-- are you sure of yourself?

---
It is not too late?"


---
if-- you think,
---
you ca n't bring
 yourself to it
---
you know
---
it done quick
---
My strength is tried by the undertaking
---
if that's not too soon for you
---
My friend
 Gillingham is here. 
---
whose eye is so keen for material things
---
they were in
---
The flap of the bureau chanced, and
---
It has just come."


---
THAT was put in
---
it to be
---
" But this is the prettiest
---
," said Mrs. Edlin. 
---
" That one is no better
 than very sackcloth o' Scripture!"


---
it to be
---
" Yes-- I meant. " It is adulterous! 
---
It signifies--
---
" You med!"
---
said the widow. 
---
" It do make my heart
 ache
---
a- burned by the flames--
---
to see such pretty open- work as that not
 that ornamental night- rails can be much use to a' ould' ooman like I.

---
" It is an accursed thing
---
-- it reminds me of what I want to forget!"

---
" It is only fit for the fire."


---
" Lord, you be too strict! 
---
What do ye use such words for, and condemn
 to hell your dear little innocent children that's lost to' ee! 
---
I do n't call that religion!"

 That
 kills me!" 
---
-- you ought
---
said
 Mrs. Edlin indignantly. 
---
" I'll tell' ee!"" You are in love wi' t' other still!"


---
If you did n't like
---
, it might not have been so much my duty.

---
Mrs. Edlin
 left the room.


---
who still sat over the supper- table
---
They soon rose, and. 
---
The pear has dropped
 into your hand."


---
there seems a touch of selfishness in it. 
---
I'm bound! " Well--, do it
 now in God's name! 
---
the bird go in such an obviously suicidal way
---
Once you've got
---
that had at bottom nothing to

---
, there was little logic, for one holding
 my views on other subjects.
---
whether it would ever happen

---
it wo n't do
---
" Yes; but you must tighten the reins by degrees only. 
---
The caution was unnecessary,. 
---
what my vicar at Shaston said,
---
you can do
---
when I left after the row
 The only thing
 to retrieve your position and hers is.' 
---
The gate of Mrs. Edlin's cottage clicked, and
---
somebody began. 
---
this ought
---
it ca n't be right, and
---
you
 ought. 
---
Of course everybody will say. 
---
it was
 very good and forgiving of' ee
---
" A great
 piece of laxity will be rectified.
---
Now that's all I have to say." 
---
" You've
 turned round, Mrs. Edlin. 
---
It is unseemly of you!"


---
you'd be affronted at what I had to say
---
You've been too kind a neighbour
 for that. 
---
what's best for myself and
 Susanna
---
you wo n't go to church with us, then
---
what the times be coming
 to
---
Matrimony have growed. 
---
that one
 really do feel afeard
---
In my time we took it
 more careless; and
---
that we was any the worse for it
---
we kept up the junketing all
 the week, and!"


---
" Now you've got so far. 
---
you ought
---
That's my
 opinion.
---
; that's true. 
---
" Now, never you have qualms, old boy. 
---
you mean. 
---
It has always been on
 my conscience, and
---
now we've got to this stage
---
when it gets known
---
Though so elusive, hers is such an honest nature at bottom. 
---
The
 fact of goes for nothing. 
---
The fog of the previous day or two on the low- lands
 had travelled up here by now, and the trees on the green caught
 armfuls, and. 
---
The bride was
 waiting, ready; bonnet and all on. 
---
Gillingham joined them, and
---
" Where is the church?"
---
since the old church was pulled down
---
presently the tower loomed large and
 solemn in the fog. 
---
The vicar had already crossed to the building,
 and
---
when they entered
---
We almost want candles
---
You do
---
me to be yours
---
There they stood, five altogether:
---
the parson, the clerk, the couple,
 and Gillingham; and the holy ordinance was resolemnized forthwith.

---
:

" God hath jined indeed
---
It was like a re- enactment by the ghosts of their former selves of
 the similar scene which had taken place at Melchester years before.

---
When the books were signed
---
All's well
---
that ends well
---
" May you long be happy together, after thus having been' saved as by
 fire.'
---
They came down the nearly empty building, and. 
---
Gillingham wanted, and. 
---
they'll
 all say'."


---
When the schoolmaster got back
---
" It is for our
 good socially to do this, and." 
---
that's its justification,
---
if it was not
 my reason
---
The rain was coming
 down. 
---
"-- that's! 
---
If you
 ca n't take me and
---
Only just now two undergraduates winked at me. 
---
who spoke thus
---
" Then you turn me away?"


---
" Oh, but ca n't you have the kindness to take me in? 
---
if you talk about them
---
The house is full
---
" That would be a palace for me!"


---
" There is no bedstead in it."


---
" A bit of a bed could be made on the floor. 
---
It would be good enough
 for me."


---
" You may remember me formerly?"
---
The householder said. 
---
" But still,
 we'll do for a day
 or two--?
---
what we can
---
And an arrangement
 was ultimately come to.


---
under which a bed was
---
While they were waiting
---
for this to be done
---
You know
 the news
---
what you mean
---
that the wedding was
---
if it had

---
" No, no: of course you do n't. 
---
Only it shows
---
If it's done
---
, so Anny says. 
---
" No-- the temptations are too many
---
, the shops being shut
---
if you like
---
While they sat without speaking
---
It's no business of mine, but
---
if it really did take place--
---
if you wanted

---
could you?
---
" You
 can ask about it
---
if you like
---
It must have been very private,.
---
if-- they have married
---
dragged thither by feverish haste. 
---
" They are married."


---
" Yes-- of course they are!"
---
" Anny says,
!"


---
that it was very sad, and curious
---
" How do you mean sad? 
---
" Yes-- that was it. 
---
Mrs. Edlin was much upset by it all, and. 
---
though others do n't
---
It is n't nt
---
some to spare
---
The evening passed, and
---
Only you must help me: and
---
you can do
 no less, after what I've stood' ee."


---
you to do
 to- night
---
All is not
---
you'd soon get tired of giving yourself airs and keeping
 away
---
" Well-- don't do the door. 
---
That's all I say.
---
You've come
---
You are not well.

---
Now you must have something better than that." 
---
" You shall have a liqueur
---
You shall have maraschino, or
 curaçao dry or sweet, or cherry brandy. 
---
mine go damn!... 
---
did not appear, but
---
When they had
---
as it were
---
,
 personally conducted through the varieties of spirituous delectation
 by one who knew the landmarks well
---
what happens to me
---
The closing hour
 came, and
---
they were compelled
---
When they were in the streets
---
what our
 landlord will say to my bringing you home in this state
---
we
 are fastened out
---
" That's the worst of not having a home of your own. 
---
what we had best do
---
nobody will see you at
 all; and."


---
by to- morrow morning you'll be all right
---
What the devil does
---
" it matter
 to me?"


---
" This-- is th' Martyrs'--burning- place
---
as they
 dragged across a broad street
---
to be burned have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.'_--Often
. 
---
Though I give my body
, and as I pass here Ridley was a--"

" Yes. 
---
even though it has n't

---
" Why, yes it has! 
---
But-- ah you
 do n't understand!--it wants! 
---
what you like with me
---
Hang her!--I mean
---
to nobody else, till death us do part! 
---
The circumstances were not altogether unlike those of their entry
 into the cottage at Cresscombe, such a long time before. 
---
as you can
---
" It is as dark as pitch
---
That's it. 
---
But-- are we out in our old house by Marygreen?"
---
And where
 are my books? 
---
That's?"


---
" We are at my house, dear,. 
---
where there's nobody
---
how ill
 you are
---
Now-- third stair, fourth stair-- that's it. 
---
Now we shall
 get on."




---
it was ready
---
" You must mind the shop this morning
---
If you live here
---
you must put your shoulder to the wheel,
!"


---
the business started
---
What's that?
---
we've
---
What to do is to
."


---
as we were
---
" How was that?"


---
" Ah...  Well it is the rummest thing I ever heard of--! 
---
well,
 perhaps it is funny, rather!" 
---
Whatever you advance
---
that was asleep

---
How are you now, dear?
---
" It is I-- Arabella."


---
You gave me shelter... 
---
That's!"


---
There's nobody in the house but father and me,
 and
---
you can rest. 
---
till you are thoroughly well
---
what they are thinking at the lodgings
---
Perhaps you had better let, or

---
me pay up
---
they'll think?"


---
we've run away
---
You'll find enough money in my pocket there."


---
Scarcely half an hour had elapsed ere
---
how they had come there
---
we must keep plenty
 of good liquor. 
---
Well, that will
 be the licence
---
You must pay for the liquor. 
---
A few
 friends, and a quiet convivial party would be the thing,. 
---
if we could
 get it up
---
It would advertise the shop, and."


---
" That can be got up easy enough by anybody who'll afford victuals and
 drink... 
---
Well yes-- it would advertise the shop--
---
that's true."


---
; nevertheless that party
 advertised it well, and
---
the Donns acquired a real notoriety among a
 certain class in Christminster who knew not the colleges, nor their
 works, nor their ways. 
---
they knew
---
There were none in, but
---
the guests sitting round, card- playing, and drinking,
---
how the party went
 off
---
if they caroused late the night before
---
that the door was open
---
though the
 shutters of the meat- stall were not down
---
Hosts and guests were sitting card- playing, smoking, and talking,
; the gas was
 burning and the curtains drawn, though it had been broad daylight
 for two hours out of doors.


---
" Here we are, just the same. 
---
We
 ought
---
to be ashamed of ourselves, ought n't we? 
---
But it is a sort of
 housewarming, you see; and
---
our friends are in no hurry. 
---
The tinker, or rather reduced ironmonger, was nothing loath, and

---
It seemed."


---
" So you are. 
---
" Well, we've been waiting for certain legal hours
---
as we find
---
we ca n't do without one another after all
---
So, as a
 bright notion, we agreed."


---
till it was late enough
---
The entrance of Taylor infused fresh
 spirit into the company, and
---
they remained,:"."


---
Now we may as well go
---
" But the parson do n't know?"


---
that we might come between eight and
 nine,
---
as there were reasons of decency for doing it as early and
 quiet as possible
---
it being our second marriage,
---
on account of which
 might make people curious to look on if they knew. 
---
as you promised
---
" You've promised.
---
several times as we've sat here to- night
---
These gentlemen have heard
 you."


---
" You and my daughter have been living here together these
 three or four days, quite on the understanding that you were going to

---
As a point of honour you must do it
 now."


---
It is a
 mere rhetorical figure--."


---
what they call in the books, hyperbole
---
who shelter you
---
" Come up and wash your face, and just put yourself tidy, and
 off we'll go. 
---
They shook hands. 
---
they went.


---
while we are gone
---
when we come back

---
we'll all have some. 
---
A good strong cup of tea will set everybody
 right for going home."




---
errand the assembled guests yawned themselves wider awake, and
. 
---
Tinker Taylor, being
 the most sober, reasoned the most lucidly.


---
" But it do seem a
 rare curiosity for a couple to marry over again! 
---
If they could n't
 get on the first time when their minds were limp
---
" Do you think?"


---
Did n't you hear?"


---
" Well," said Tinker Taylor,.

---
that have
 been in circulation
---
To be sure, halfpence ca n't be expected. 
---
that's been knocking about the four
 hemispheres for some time
---
The curtains were undrawn, and the
 expression of the house made to look like morning. 
---
Some of the
 guests, however, fell asleep in their chairs. 
---
One or two went to the
 door, and. 
---
Tinker Taylor was
 the chief of these, and
---
the deed's done
---
I think!"

" No," said Uncle Joe,. 
---
They are walking in a very unusual way;
 and
---
that's the meaning of it!"


---
They waited in silence. 
---
till the wedding- party could be heard
---
" Mrs. Fawley, I presume?" said Tinker Taylor with mock courtesy.


---
There's the padlock,

---
you have both

---
you ought now
---
to be forgiven by the
 world,
---
as you have forgiven each other
---
But, Jude, my dear, you were enough to make a cat
 laugh! 
---
You walked that straight, and.
---
that
 one would have thought;
---
you were going' prentice to a judge
---
you were seeing double all the time, from the way you fumbled
 with my finger
---
" I said I'd do anything to--," And I've done it!"

" Well now, old deary, come along and."


---
There's no more left. 
---
The tea will take
 the muddle out of our heads, and
---
we shall be as fresh as larks."


---
I've-- married you. 
---
It is true religion! 
---
Michaelmas came and, and
---
it was now
 precarious. 
---
to keep' ee
 entirely-- that's! 
---
what' twill come to
---
no business to be saddled with at all. 
---
Why
 did n't you keep your health,? 
---
You were well
 enough!"


---
when the wedding was
---
you and I killed during our
 first marriage. 
---
that the greatest mercy that could be
 vouchsafed to me would be
---
that something should serve me that animal
---
This was the sort of discourse that went on between them every day
 now. 
---
who had heard
---
that they were a
 queer couple
---
The landlord of the lodging,, had doubted; and
---
if they were married at all, especially

---
that they must be respectable
---
what it was
---
" What in the name-- do you want?"


---
" It is!"


---
" It is just in order not to insult you that I ask you to do it. 
---
You
 know
---
" You've no respect for marriage whatever, or its rights and duties!"


---
" What DOES it matter a wretch like me! 
---
what my opinions are--
---
who comes
---
" What do you want? 
---
how you are for
---
as the words were spoken
---
there's no meaning in what I
 say
---
" What do you want?"
---
me to do
---
" But what
 it is worth
---
"

" You could n't kill the pig, but
---
you could kill me!"


---
" Ah-- there you have me! 
---
you were ill
---
that lives on a drop and a crumb
---
expected all the next day; neither
 was there any note of reply. 
---
that your duty towards your
 invalid was
---
where the
 devil is
---
A driving rain from the north- east had been falling with more or less
 intermission all the morning, and
---
it became a certainty
. 
---
much stared at by other passengers. 
---
The rain was keeping everybody indoors
---
one evidently
 allowed out before hours for some reason or other
---
the child came.


---
The child departed, and
---
Everything
 was new, except a few pieces of carving preserved from the wrecked
 old fabric, now fixed against the new walls. 
---
it was you
---
" Do n't go-- don't go!"
---
" This is my last time! 
---
it would be less intrusive than to enter your house
---
We are

---
But why did you
 come, and?"


---
as you
 have done
---
It was in the Alfredston paper. 
---
And therefore
 you did so well
---
" God above-- and is that all I've come to hear? 
---
If there is anything
 more degrading, immoral, unnatural, than another in my life
---
You are mine.
---
me rush away from you
---
how you did it
---
how you think it
---
will you--
---
Oh you darling little fool
---
"; where is your reason? 
---
You seem! 
---
Or is it?
---
that you are humbugging yourself,; and
---
what
 you pretend to
---
raised by an affected belief
---
How can you be so cruel!"


---
that it has ever been my lot
---
Where is your
 scorn of convention gone? 
---
You crush
---
It has
 been-- only a church marriage-- an apparent marriage I mean! 
---
" it is a nominal marriage only. 
---
It has n't been more than that
!"


---
If misery can know happiness
---
you hold holy
---
You do love me still?
---
You know it too well!... 
---
" And yet you are so dear!--and
---
you look so ill--"

"
---
And so do you! 
---
There's one more, in memory of our dead little
 children-- yours and mine!"


---
me make my last appeal
---
We've both

---
You were
 the same. 
---
; you were creed- drunk. 
---
Either form of
 intoxication takes away the nobler vision... 
---
us then shake off
 our mistakes, and
---
Why do you tempt me so far, Jude! 
---
It is too
 merciless!... 
---
which still contained

---
There are cold spots up and down Wessex in autumn and winter weather;
 but
---
when a north or east wind is blowing
---
the coldest of all is the
 crest of the down by the Brown House, where the road to Alfredston
 crosses the old Ridgeway. 
---
Here the first winter sleets and snows
 fall and, and here the spring frost lingers last unthawed. 
---
as it was
---
It was still there; but
---
nearly
 obliterated by moss. 
---
" You've been?"
---
whether you know it
---
You think; and
---
you are the stronger
---
so
 you are, in a physical sense, now. 
---
You could push me over like a
 nine- pin. 
---
You did not send that letter the other day, and
---
as
 you think
---
which ought
---
" Lord-- you do talk lofty! 
---
Wo n't you have something warm to drink?
---
's get home
---
They went along by the silent colleges, and
---
" What are you looking at?"


---
in a way, those spirits of the dead again,
 on this my last walk, that I saw
---
" What a curious chap you are!"


---
them rustling
---
The theologians, the apologists, and their kin the metaphysicians,
 the high- handed statesmen, and others, no longer interest me. 
---
that has been spoilt for me by the grind of stern reality
---
like one watching a figure walk out
---
" They seem!"


---
They used Ken--"


---
There's neither living nor dead
 hereabouts except a damn policeman! 
---
The Poet of Liberty used, and the great
 Dissector of Melancholy there!"


---
They bore me."


---
" Walter Raleigh is beckoning to me from that lane-- Wycliffe-- Harvey--
 Hooker-- Arnold-- and a whole crowd of Tractarian Shades--"

" I DON'T WANT to know their names
---
Upon my soul you are more sober!"


---
when you've been
 drinking than when you have not
---
" This is old Rubric. 
---
And that Sarcophagus; and up that lane Crozier
 and Tudor: and all down there is Cardinal with its long front, and

---
its windows with lifted eyebrows, representing the polite surprise of
 the university at the efforts of such as I."

" Come along, and!"


---
It will help me home,. 
---
as if death- claws were grabbing me through
 and through
---
As Antigone said
---
my spirit flitting
 up and down here among these
---
You may n't die after all. 
---
It was night at Marygreen, and
---
the rain of the afternoon showed no
 sign of abatement. 
---
" Lord love' ee, what do ye do that yourself for,! 
---
You knew."


---
you'll keep two servants. 
---
This pretty body of mine
 has been the ruin of me already!"


---
when I've come o'
 purpose I should come" Oh-- I do n't know-- I forgot!  No, I did n't forget.  I did it to
 discipline myself.  I have scrubbed the stairs since eight o'clock.
 I MUST practise myself in my household duties.  I've shamefully
 neglected them!"

" Pshoo-- you've got no body to speak of! 
---
You put me more in mind
 of a sperrit. 
---
But there seems something wrong to- night, my dear.

---
" Then what is it?"


---
" I told' ee!"

" But it sha n't be! 
---
; it is
 not necessary. 
---
it has gone
 on three months very well
---
as it is
---
It ought. 
---
not to have been
 accepted by me
---
it will be terrible--
---
What is it
---
It is something... 
---
The mournful
 thing is,."


---
that nobody would admit it as a reason for feeling as I do;

---
so that no excuse is left me
---
what it was
---
" I've heard strange tales o' husbands in my time," observed the widow
 in a lowered voice. 
---
why that should
 come into my head,
---
for it is only a tale
---
What a wind and rain it
 is to- night! 
---
Well-- don't be in a hurry to alter things, my dear.

---
it must be now-- at once-- before I break down!"


---
you ought
---
" No-- no-- don't go, Mrs. Edlin,
---
" But it is bedtime, child."


---
" Yes, but-- there's the little spare room-- my room that was. 
---
It is
 quite ready. 
---
Please stay, Mrs. Edlin!--I shall want you in the
 morning."


---
if you wish
---
" Oh well-- I do n't mind,.  Nothing will happen to my four
 old walls,."


---
they ascended the stairs
 together.


---
the door knelt down by the bed for a minute or two
---
The snoring had quite ceased for some time, but
---
" No, dear," said the widow,. 
---
it takes me a long while to un- ray. 
---
's go and
---
The widow retreated a second time.


---
Is that you, Susanna?"


---
" Yes."

" What do you want? 
---
When we were at Shaston
---
that
 you should come near me. 
---
" Perhaps you only think? 
---
you ought
---
we were going
---
till we
 did
---
after it is
---
that portion of
 the scene remained untold. 
---
it overcame me.

---
It blots out all that life
 of mine!"


---
you really mean

---
which seemed to

---
You know. 
---
what it means
---
Having you back in the
 house was one thing-- this another. 
---
" I will."

" Now I supplicate you, Richard, to whom I belong, and whom I wish to
 honour and obey, as I vowed,."

" I have thought-- I wish this!"

" That's a complaisant spirit-- and
---
perhaps you are right. 
---
a
 lover hanging about
---
With, a half- marriage should be completed. 
---
But I
 repeat my reminder this third and last time." It is my wish!... 
---
" What did you say' O God' for?"


---
" I do n't know!"

" Yes you do! 
---
it might end like this
---
" What's the matter?"
---
" You shrink from me again?-- just as formerly!"


---
" You wish?"


---
" Yes."

" You still bear in mind?"


---
what it means
---
It is my duty!"


---
if the
 little thing is all right
---
How it do blow and!"


---
The widow went out on the landing, and. 
---
Weddings be funerals' a b'lieve nowadays. 
---
Fifty- five
 years ago, come Fall,! 
---
Times have changed
 since then!"




---
if you
 have n't been clever in this last stroke
---
Moving the blocks always used to strain
 me, and standing the trying draughts in buildings before the windows
 are in, and
---
that began the mischief
 inside
---
if the
 founders had such as I in their minds-- a fellow good for nothing else
 but that particular thing?
---
that soon there is going to

---
There are
 schemes afoot for making the university less exclusive, and extending
 its influence. 
---
And it is too late, too
 late for me! 
---
" How you keep a- mumbling!"
---
you'd have got over all that craze about books by this time
---
And so
 you would, if you'd had any sense to begin with. 
---
You are as bad now
."


---
as when we were first married
---
you'd mind
---
who you are talking to
---
how things were going
---
you want
---
if you like
---
" Oh-- that's a change!"


---
Mrs. Edlin came. 
---
whose feelings as to had reached absolute indifference by
 this time
---
Mrs. Edlin hesitated. 
---
" Well, no-- it's different now. 
---
" The night after you came. 
---
this is almost more than I can
 endure!... 
---
Mrs. Edlin-- don't be frightened at my rambling-- I've

---
who saw all MY superstitions as cobwebs
---
Then bitter affliction came to us, and
---
And now the ultimate
 horror has come--! 
---
that the
 very wind seemed
---
when we were at our own best, long ago--
---
when our minds
 were clear, and
---
our love of truth fearless-- the time was not ripe
 for us! 
---
Our ideas were fifty years too soon to be any good to us.

---
There-- this, Mrs. Edlin, is. 
---
which started a fit of coughing
---
Presently there
 came a knock at the door downstairs. 
---
As nobody answered it
---
Mrs.
 Edlin herself went down.


---
The visitor said blandly:" The Doctor." 
---
" How is my patient at present?"
---
Vilbert went; but
---
with such striking epithets, that Vilbert soon
 scurried downstairs again
---
that the Doctor looked
---
" There's
 nobody but me about the house to- day."


---
What is this
---
that you sold me at the
 agricultural show,
---
But you must be prepared for the
 consequences." 
---
if my
 poor fellow upstairs do go off--
---
-- it's well
. 
---
And one must take the old."




---
if one ca n't get the
 young
---
to which the chronicler of these lives would ask the
 reader's attention
---
when leafy summer came round again
---
It was afternoon, and
---
some one to come and
---
Certain sounds from without revealed that the town was in festivity,
. 
---
whatever it might have been
---
Bells began, and
---
the notes came into the room
 through the open window, and.

---
which was hung up by way of timepiece
---
The house
 was empty. 
---
The attraction to go abroad had
 evidently drawn away the other inmates long before.


---
It was a warm, cloudless, enticing day. 
---
who had come up from the country for the
 day
---
People were picnicking on the grass, and
---
the carriages drawing
 up for the concert, numerous Dons and their wives, and undergraduates
 with gay female companions, crowding up likewise
---
When the doors
 were, and
---
the concert began
---
The powerful notes of that concert rolled forth through the swinging
 yellow blinds of the open windows, over the housetops, and into the
 still air of the lanes. 
---
it was about this time.


---
The room remained still as before. 
---
No water came, and
---
the organ notes, faint as a bee's hum, rolled in
 as before.


---
,, shouts and hurrahs came from
 somewhere in the direction of the river.


---
The hurrahs were repeated,. 
---
in which it
 was said
---
" Let the day perish, and the night, There is a man- child conceived."
---
that day be darkness
---
not God regard it from above,
---
the light shine upon it
---
Lo, let,."
---
that night be solitary
---
no
 joyful voice come therein
---
_" Why died I not from the womb? 
---
Why did I not give up the ghost when
 I came out of the belly?...  For now should I have lain still and
 I should have slept: then had I been at rest!"" There the prisoners rest together
---
; they hear not the voice of the
 oppressor... 
---
The small and the great are there; and
---
what was going on
---
A corridor was in course of erection from
 the entrance to the hall staircase, of gay red and buff bunting.

---
Waggon- loads of boxes containing bright plants in full bloom were
 being placed about, and
---
the great staircase was covered with red
 cloth. 
---
where they were putting
 down a new floor and decorating for the dance
---
The cathedral bell close at hand was sounding for five o'clock
 service.


---
-- there's a lot to do. 
---
" We are just going down
 to the river
---
," said the former,". 
---
But we've
 called round on our way.
---
" That's right. 
---
Well now, ca n't you give yourself half an hour's
 relaxation, Mrs. Fawley, and? 
---
' Twould do you
 good."


---
it is good fun
---
They waited, and
---
Downstairs the inmates were absent
 as before,. 
---
the
 procession of boats was
---
" to
 see the boats himself-- that's!"


---
what it is
---
A second glance caused, and
---
; they were cold,. 
---
All was still within. 
---
The
 bumping of near thirty years had ceased.


---
what had happened
---
" said one of the workmen. 
---
" We wondered. 
---
if you were

---
Come along; we must be quick to get a good
 place... 
---
Of course, we do n't
 want
---
They went with the crowd down Cardinal Street, where they presently
 reached the bridge, and
---
the gay barges burst upon their view. 
---
Thence
 they passed by a narrow slit down to the riverside path-- now dusty,
 hot, and thronged. 
---
as they had arrived
---
Almost as soon the grand
 procession of boats began; the oars smacking with a loud kiss on the
 face of the stream, as they were lowered from the perpendicular.


---
my being away
---
That philtre is operating
---
", you know!
---
It is a general holiday."


---
The crowd surged,, and
---
The fun on the water reached the acme of excitement
---
; there were
 immersions
---
, there were shouts
---
: the race was lost and.


---
who had watched
---
" Well-- it's been awfully good
---
" What's your hurry?"


---
Dear, dear, this is awkward!"


---
where the people ascended from the riverside

---
the crowd was literally jammed into one hot
 mass-- Arabella and Vilbert with the rest
---
here they remained
 motionless,
---
that to have died alone an inquest might be deemed necessary
---
What a fidget you are, my love
---
" Just as well have patience: there's
---
It was. 
---
nearly ten minutes before the wedged multitude moved
 sufficiently to let them pass through
---
" Can you come and
?"


---
being nearly knocked down by the carriages
---
It is just round here
---
", is n't it? 
---
when the sky was equally cloudless, and the air
 equally still
---
the worn old
 eyelids of Mrs. Edlin being red
---
The window was still open, and
---
it being about

---
the clear air was motionless and quiet without. 
---
From a
 distance came voices; and an apparent noise of persons stamping.


---
" What's that?
---
" Oh, that's the Doctors in the theatre,. 
---
It's Remembrance Week,. 
---
you know
---
at which
 there seemed
---
The bells struck out joyously; and
---
their
 reverberations travelled round the bed- room.


---
" D'ye think?
---
" That's... 
---
what we do n't know
---
tis to be believed
---
it wo n't be true!
