O
     ye men, how can it be but
---
The miller at Cresscombe lent him the small white tilted cart and
 horse to carry his goods to the city of his destination, about twenty
 miles off, such a vehicle proving of quite sufficient size for the
 departing teacher's effects. 
---
that he had bought at an auction during the year in
 which he thought of learning instrumental music
---
he had never acquired any skill in playing, and
---
the
 purchased article had been a perpetual trouble to him ever since in
 moving house.


---
He did not mean, and

---
even if he got it into the cart
---
he
 should not know,
 the city he was bound for, since he was only going into temporary
 lodgings just at first.


---
A little boy of eleven,, joined the group of men, and
---
he
 spoke up,
---
that a deputation should wait on the boy's aunt-- an
 old maiden resident-- and
---
till
 Mr. Phillotson should send for it
---
the boy
 and the schoolmaster were left.


---
Tears rose into the boy's eyes,. 
---
for he was not among the regular day
 scholars, who came unromantically close to the schoolmaster's life,
 but one who had attended the night school only during the present
 teacher's term of office
---
The boy awkwardly opened the book he held in his hand, which Mr.
 Phillotson had bestowed on him as a parting gift, and.


---
that
 he was sorry
---
" Sorry I am going, Jude?" So am I," said Mr. Phillotson.


---
" I think."


---
I should now, sir
---
It is the necessary hallmark of a man
 who wants to do anything in teaching. 
---
By going to live at
 Christminster, or near it, I shall be at headquarters,,
 and
---
, I consider."


---
The smith and his companion returned. 
---
Old Miss Fawley's fuel- house
 was dry, and eminently practicable; and
---
The boy Jude assisted in loading some small articles, and
---
at nine
 o'clock Mr. Phillotson mounted beside his box of books and other
_ impedimenta_, and
---
" I sha n't forget you, Jude,.
"
---
," he said,
---
The boy returned to the draw- well at the edge
 of the greensward, where he had left his buckets when he went to help
 his patron and teacher in the loading. 
---
There was a quiver in his lip
 now and after opening the well- cover to begin lowering the bucket he
 paused and leant with his forehead and arms against the framework,
 his face wearing the fixity of a thoughtful child's who has felt the
 pricks of life somewhat before his time. 
---
into which he was
 looking
---
from his present
 position appeared as a long circular perspective ending in a shining
 disk of quivering water at a distance of a hundred feet down.

---
He said to himself, in the melodramatic tones of a whimsical boy,
. 
---
I've seen

---
" him look down into it,,, and
---
when he was tired with his drawing
---
just as I
 do now
---
when he rested a bit before carrying the buckets home!

---
But he was too clever to bide here any longer-- a small sleepy place
 like this!"


---
A tear rolled from his eye into the depths of the well. 
---
the boy's breathing unfurled itself as
 a thicker fog upon the still and heavy air. 
---
His thoughts were

---
The boy quickly
 waved a signal of assent,
---
what was a great effort
 for one of his stature
---
he bore the two brimming
 house- buckets of water to the cottage without resting. 
---
While emptying the buckets at the back of the house he could hear an
 animated conversation in progress within- doors between his great- aunt,
 the Drusilla of the sign- board, and some other villagers. 
---
Having
 seen the school- master depart, they were summing up particulars of
 the event, and indulging in predictions of his future.


---
" And who's he?
---
when the boy
 entered
---
He's my great- nephew
---
He come
 from Mellstock, down in South Wessex, about a year ago--
---
where his father was living
---
him earn any
 penny he can
---
Just now he's a- scaring of birds for Farmer Troutham.

---
It keeps him out of mischty. 
---
But I've got him here till I can see
 though I am obliged Why do ye turn away, Jude?"
---
Miss Fawley doubted it.... 
---
The boy is crazy for books,. 
---
that he is
---
His cousin Sue is just the same--
---
Jude, my child, do n't you ever marry. 
---
Jude, finding the general attention again centering on himself, went
 out to the bakehouse, where he ate the cake provided for his
 breakfast. 
---
The end of his spare time had now arrived, and
---
he pursued a
 path northward,. 
---
till he came to a wide and lonely depression in the
 general level of the upland, which was sown as a corn- field
---
This
 vast concave was the scene of his labours for Mr Troutham the farmer,
 and
---
he descended into the midst of it.


---
that rose at his approach, and

---
by which he had come,
---
trodden now by he

---
he murmured.


---
in that ancient cornfield many a man had made love- promises to
 a woman at whose voice he had trembled by the next seed- time after
 fulfilling them in the church adjoining. 
---
But this neither Jude nor
 the rooks around him considered.
---
The boy stood under the rick, and
---
every few seconds
 used his clacker or rattle briskly. 
---
He sounded the clacker. 
---
till his arm ached, and
---
at length his heart
 grew sympathetic with the birds' thwarted desires
---
Why should
 he frighten them away? 
---
They took upon more and more the aspect of
 gentle friends and pensioners-- the only friends he could claim as
 being in the least degree interested in him,. 
---
He ceased his rattling, and
---
said Jude, aloud. 
---
A magic thread of fellow- feeling united his
 own life with theirs. 
---
Puny and sorry, they much
 resembled his own.


---
he had
---
His clacker by this time thrown away from him, as being a mean
 and sordid instrument, offensive both to the birds and to himself
 as their friend. 
---
All at once he became conscious of a smart blow
 upon his buttocks, followed by a loud clack, which announced to his
 surprised senses that the clacker had been the instrument of offence
 used. 
---
the dazed
 eyes of the latter beheld the farmer in person, the great Troutham
 himself, his red face glaring down upon Jude's cowering frame, the
 clacker swinging in his hand.


---
" So it's' Eat my dear birdies,' young man? ' Eat, dear
 birdies,' indeed! 
---
I'll tickle your breeches, and! 
---
Whilst saluting Jude's ears with this impassioned rhetoric, Troutham
 had seized his left hand with his own left, and
---
" I-- I sir-- only meant--
---
I saw-- and
---
Mr.
 Phillotson said
---
I was
---
than if Jude had stoutly denied
---
he still
 smacked urchin, the clacks of the instrument continuing
 to resound all across the field and as far as the ears of distant
 workers-- who gathered thereupon that Jude was pursuing his business
 of clacking with great assiduity-- and echoing from the brand- new
 church tower just behind the mist, towards the building of which
 structure the farmer had largely subscribed, to testify his love for
 God and man.


---
Presently Troutham grew tired of his punitive task, and.


---
him see him in one of those fields again
---
Jude leaped out of arm's reach, and.


---
that he had wholly disgraced himself, and
---
before he had been a year
 in the parish
---
With this shadow on his mind he did not care, and. 
---
Here he beheld scores of coupled earthworms
. 
---
Though Farmer Troutham had just hurt him
---
, he was a boy who could not
 himself bear to hurt anything. 
---
He had never brought home a nest of
 young birds without lying awake in misery half the night after, and
. 
---
He could scarcely bear; and
---
late pruning,, had been a positive grief to him in his
 infancy. 
---
that he was the sort of man who was born to ache a good deal before
 the fall of the curtain upon his unnecessary life
---
that
 all was well with him again
---
He carefully picked his way on tiptoe
 among the earthworms, without killing a single one.


---
On entering the cottage he found, and
---
He threw the sixpence tragically on the table.


---
His father was my
 father's journeyman, anyhow, and
---
Jude, Jude, why didstn't
 go off with that schoolmaster of thine to Christminster or somewhere?

---
Where is this beautiful city, Aunt-- this place where Mr. Phillotson
 is gone to
---
I must have been a fool to let' ee
 go to work for' n, which I should n't ha' done but to keep' ee out of
 mischty."

 It is a place much too good for you ever
 to have much to do with, poor boy, I'm a- thinking."

" And will Mr. Phillotson always be there?"


---
Jude went out, and,
---
, he lay down upon his back on a heap of litter near
 the pig- sty. 
---
He pulled his
 straw hat over his face, and. 
---
Growing up
 brought responsibilities, he found. 
---
Events did not rhyme quite as
 he had thought. 
---
Nature's logic was too horrid for him to care for.

---
felt yourself
 to be at the centre of your time, and, he perceived. 
---
If he could only prevent! 
---
himself growing up
---
He did not want.


---
Then, like the natural boy, he forgot his despondency, and.

---
During the remainder of the morning he helped his aunt, and
---
in the
 afternoon,, he went into the
 village. 
---
Here he asked.


---
Oh, well, out by there yonder; though I've never bin
 there-- not I.  I've never had any business at such a place."


---
The man pointed north- eastward, in the very direction where lay that
 field in which Jude had so disgraced himself. 
---
the fearsomeness
 of this fact rather increased his curiosity about the city. 
---
he was never
---
So,
 stealing out of the hamlet, he descended into the same hollow which
 had witnessed his punishment in the morning,. 
---
all before him was bleak
 open down.




---
The boy had never before strayed so far north as this from the
 nestling hamlet in which he had been deposited by the carrier from a
 railway station southward, one dark evening some few months earlier,
 and
---
till now he had had no suspicion that such a wide, flat,
 low- lying country lay so near at hand, under the very verge of his
 upland world. 
---
The whole northern semicircle between east and west,
 to a distance of forty or fifty miles, spread itself before him; a
 bluer, moister atmosphere, evidently, than that he breathed up here.


---
He was about to pass it when he perceived a ladder against
 the eaves; and
---
that the higher he got
---
, the further he
 could see,
---
the reflection led Jude. 
---
On the slope of the roof
 two men were repairing the tiling. 
---
He turned into the ridgeway and
.


---
When he had wistfully watched the workmen for some time he took
 courage, and.


---
till he stood beside them
---
The other tiler, glad of any kind of diversion from the monotony of
 his labour, had also turned.

---
," he said. 
---
I've noticed,
 and
---
-- I do n't know what.
---
though I should never ha' thought of it myself
---
But I ca n't
 see no Christminster to- day."


---
The boy strained his eyes also; yet neither. 
---
could he see the far- off
 city
---
He descended from the barn, and. 
---
he walked along the ridge- track, thereabout
---
When he repassed the barn
---
to go back to Marygreen he
 observed.


---
that the men had
 finished their day's work and
---
He thought again of Christminster, and
. 
---
since he had come two or three miles from his aunt's house
 on purpose
---
that he could have seen for once this attractive city of
 which he had been told
---
even if he waited here
---
Yet he was loth to
.


---
He ascended the ladder. 
---
the men
 had designated,
---
He might not be able to come so far as this for many
 days. 
---
if he prayed
---
He had read in a tract that
 a man who had begun to build a church, and had no money to finish
 it, knelt down and prayed, and
---
Another man tried the same experiment, and
---
he found afterwards. 
---
he knelt in
---
where, resting against those above it,
 he prayed
---
He then seated himself again, and. 
---
The
 boy immediately looked back in the old direction.


---
Turning to the west, he saw. 
---
He anxiously descended the ladder, and. 
---
the corpses round him
---
He knew, yet
---
that he had grown out of belief in
 these horrors
---
he was glad,
---
when he saw the church tower and the
 lights in the cottage windows
---
even though this was not the home of
 his birth, and
---
which a strong
 man could have carried
---
, Jude had his outer being for some long
 tideless time. 
---
But his dreams were as gigantic as his surroundings
 were small.


---
he was always beholding a gorgeous city-- the fancied place he had
 likened to the new Jerusalem,. 
---
though there was perhaps more of the
 painter's imagination and less of the diamond merchant's in his
 dreams thereof than in those of the Apocalyptic writer
---
And the city
 acquired a tangibility, a permanence, a hold on his life, mainly from
 the one nucleus of fact that the man for whose knowledge and purposes
 he had so much reverence was actually living there; not only so, but
 living among the more thoughtful and mentally shining ones therein.


---
though he knew
---
In sad wet seasons,,
 he could hardly believe. 
---
Whenever
 he could get away from the confines of the hamlet for an hour or two,

---
, he would steal off to the Brown House on the
 hill and
---
strain his eyes persistently; sometimes to be rewarded by
 the sight of a dome or spire, at other times by a little smoke, which
 in his estimate had some of the mysticism of incense.


---
when it suddenly occurred to him
---
if he
 ascended to the point of view after dark, or
---
that possibly went a mile or
 two further, he would see the night lights of the city
---
even that consideration did not
 deter him,.


---
for he could throw a little manliness into his mood, no
 doubt
---
when he arrived at
 the place of outlook
---
He was rewarded; but
---
what he saw
---
as he had half expected
---
He set himself
---
In the glow he
 seemed.


---
Phillotson promenading at ease
---
He had heard,
 and
---
the fact now came into his mind. 
---
He parted his lips, and.


---
as he faced
 the north- east
---
," he said,
---
being breathed by him
---
Suddenly there came along this wind something towards him-- a message
 from the place-- from some soul residing there
---
, the voice of the city, faint and musical,
 calling to him," We are happy here!"


---
He had become. 
---
on which he paused a team of horses

---
They were elderly men, and. 
---
Jude addressed them,
.


---
He was getting. 
---
that, like a young lover
 alluding to his mistress, he felt bashful at mentioning its name
 again
---
He pointed to the light in the sky-- hardly perceptible to
 their older eyes.


---
which Jude had tucked up under his arm
---
Here a little book of tales,
 having brought them to read on his way hither,
 slipped and. 
---
The carter eyed him.


---
while he picked
 it up and
---
though I should n't ha' noticed it myself, and no doubt it
 med," he observed,
---
" Ah, young man" you'd have."


---
for I never could understand it
---
, I suppose,? 
---
And to turn a lirruping hobble- de- hoy chap into a solemn
 preaching man with no corrupt passions, they'll do it, and a long black coat and waistcoat, and a religious
 collar and hat,
---
that I be a- talking of the college life
---
though I myself med
---
, so be they
 in their minds-- noble- minded men enough, no doubt-- some on' em-- able
 to earn hundreds by thinking out loud. 
---
I should
 think!"


---
I did know a little about Christminster
---
who had no objection to telling him as they moved on more yet of
 the city-- its towers and halls and churches
---
a cross- road, whereupon Jude thanked the carter warmly for his
 information, and.


---
he only wished
---
he could talk half as well about
 Christminster as he
---
when he
 was in his prime
---
" I've never been there, no more than you; but I've
 picked up the knowledge here and there, and as I do A friend o' mine, that
 used to clane the boots at the Crozier Hotel in Christminster, why, I knowed un as well as my own brother in his
 later years."


---
Jude continued his walk homeward alone,. 
---
that
 he forgot
---
He suddenly grew older. 
---
It had been the
 yearning of his heart. 
---
which he could call admirable
---
Should he find
 that place in this city if he could get there?
---
Would it be a spot in
 which, without fear of farmers, or hindrance, or ridicule, he could
 watch and wait, and set himself to some mighty undertaking like the
 men of old of whom he had heard? 
---
As the halo had been to his eyes

---
when gazing at it a quarter of an hour earlier, so was the spot
 mentally to him.


---
as he pursued his dark way
---
," he said to himself.


---
"," he added a few steps further on.


---
" It is a place that teachers of men spring from and go to."


---
After this figure he was silent a long while,."




---
till he added:

"

IV


 Walking somewhat slowly by reason of his concentration, the boy-- an
 ancient man in some phases of thought, much younger than his years
 in others-- was overtaken by a light- footed pedestrian, whom,
 notwithstanding the gloom, he could perceive to be wearing an
 extraordinarily tall hat, a swallow- tailed coat, and a watch- chain
 that danced madly and threw around scintillations of sky- light as
 its owner swung along upon a pair of thin legs and noiseless boots.

---
Jude, beginning to feel lonely, endeavoured.


---
I'm in a hurry,
---
who I am
---
" Yes, I think. 
---
" Ah-- I'm known everywhere, I see! 
---
Vilbert was an itinerant quack- doctor, well known to the rustic
 population, and absolutely unknown to anybody else, as he, indeed,
 took care to be, to avoid inconvenient investigations. 
---
Cottagers
 formed his only patients, and
---
his Wessex- wide repute was among them
 alone. 
---
His position was humbler and his field more obscure than
 those of the quacks with capital and an organized system of
 advertising. 
---
He was, in fact, a survival. 
---
he
 traversed on foot
---
Jude had one day. 
---
him selling a pot of
 coloured lard to an old woman as a certain cure for a bad leg,
---
though he already had his doubts about this gentleman's
 medicines
---
Jude,, felt.


---
him to be unquestionably a travelled personage, and
 one who might be a trustworthy source of information on matters not
 strictly professional
---
" I s'pose"


---
I have-- many times
---
"," replied the long thin man. 
---
Well-- that's more for the men who are in training for bishops,."


---
" I want."


---
" I mean.
---
if I promise
---
" I'll sell you mine with pleasure-- those I used as a student."


---
" Oh, thank you, sir!" said Jude gratefully, but in gasps, for the
 amazing speed of the physician's walk kept him in a dog- trot which
 was giving him a stitch in the side.


---
" I think. 
---
Now I'll tell you
. 
---
what I'll do
---
I'll get you the grammars, and."


---
" I shall be passing here this day fortnight at precisely this hour of
 five- and- twenty minutes past seven. 
---
" Here I'll be
---
to meet you," said Jude.


---
Jude then dropped behind,.


---
Through the intervening fortnight he ran about and.


---
He honestly performed his promise to the man of many cures, in whom
 he now sincerely believed, walking miles hither and thither among
 the surrounding hamlets as the Physician's agent in advance. 
---
he stood motionless on the plateau, at the place
 where he had parted from Vilbert, and
---
there awaited his approach.

---
to the surprise of
 Jude on striking into his pace,, the latter seemed hardly,. 
---
Jude thought, and
---
it might perhaps be owing to his

---
he saluted the physician with dignity.


---
" Well, my boy?" said the latter abstractedly.


---
I've come
---
"," said Jude.


---
And Jude told him the names and addresses of the cottagers
 who were willing to test the virtues of the world- renowned pills and
 salve. 
---
Jude's voice trembled with
 anxiety.


---
, you see, my man, that I ca n't give so much thought as I
 would like to other things."


---
Jude controlled himself sufficiently long;
 and
---
he repeated, in a voice of dry misery,"!"


---
I'll
 bring the grammars next time."


---
Jude dropped behind. 
---
He was an unsophisticated boy, but
---
the gift of
 sudden insight which is sometimes vouchsafed to children showed him
 all at once. 
---
The leaves dropped from
 his imaginary crown of laurel
---
; he turned to a gate, leant against it,
 and cried bitterly.


---
He
 might, perhaps, have obtained grammars from Alfredston, but
---
though physically comfortable, he was in such absolute dependence.


---
At this date Mr. Phillotson sent for his pianoforte, and
---
it gave Jude
 a lead. 
---
Why should he not write to the schoolmaster, and? 
---
He might
 slip a letter inside the case of the instrument, and
---
To tell his aunt of his intention would be. 
---
he did
---
Jude waited days and weeks,. 
---
he
 saw from the ends of it. 
---
He took it
 away into a lonely place, and.


---
Ever since his first ecstasy or vision of Christminster and its
 possibilities, Jude had meditated much and curiously on the probable
 sort of process that was involved in turning the expressions of one
 language into those of another. 
---
He concluded. 
---
that a grammar of the
 required tongue would contain, primarily, a rule, prescription, or
 clue of the nature of a secret cipher, which, once known, would
 enable him, by merely applying it, to change at will all words of his
 own speech into those of the foreign one
---
His childish idea was, in
 fact, a pushing to the extremity of mathematical precision what is
 everywhere known as Grimm's Law-- an aggrandizement of rough rules to
 ideal completeness. 
---
Thus he assumed aforesaid.


---
When, therefore, having noted, he cut the string
---
he could scarcely
 believe his eyes
---
But this was not the cause of Jude's amazement.

---
He learnt for the first time, but
---
as in his innocence he had supposed
---
Jude flung down the books,. 
---
As he had often done before
---
, he pulled his hat over his
 face and. 
---
the sun peering insidiously at him through the
 interstices of the straw
---
he had supposed in store for him
---
, he
 presently thought,!

---
There were no brains in his head equal to this business; and
---
to stream in through his hat at him, he
 wished.


---
he had never seen a book,
---
that he might never see another,

---
that he had never been born
---
who would have asked him his
 trouble, and
---
that his notions were
 further advanced than those of his grammarian
---
under the crushing recognition of his
 gigantic error Jude continued.




---
In the course of a month or two after the receipt of the books
 Jude had grown callous to the shabby trick. 
---
In fact, his disappointment at the nature of those
 tongues had,. 
---
as he now knew them
 inherently
---
which gradually
 led him on to a greater interest in it than in the presupposed patent
 process
---
The mountain- weight of material piqued him into a dogged,
 mouselike subtlety of attempt to move it piecemeal.


---
He had endeavoured, and
---
in this turn- out it became Jude's business thrice a
 week immediately round Marygreen.


---
The singularity aforesaid lay, after all, less in the conveyance
 itself than in Jude's manner of conducting it along its route.

---
Its interior was the scene of most of Jude's education by" private
 study." 
---
as the horse had learnt the road and the houses
 at which he was to pause awhile
---
As soon, the boy, seated in front, would
 slip the reins over his arm,.


---
he was reading
---
as the case might be, in his purblind
 stumbling way, and with an expenditure of labour that would have made
 a tender- hearted pedagogue shed tears
---
what he read
---
which often to his mind was something else
 than that which he was taught to look for
---
he had been able to lay hands on
---
that they were passably
 good for him
---
as he would have used a comrade or tutor who should
 have happened to be passing by
---
though Jude may have had little
 chance of becoming a scholar by these rough and ready means
---
And, he was
 in the way of getting into the groove he wished to follow.


---
While he was busied with these ancient pages, which had already been
 thumbed by hands possibly in the grave,
---
digging out the thoughts
 of these minds so remote yet so near, the bony old horse pursued
 his rounds, and
---
Jude would be aroused from the woes of Dido by the
 stoppage of his cart and the voice of some old woman crying," Two
 to- day, baker, and I return this stale one."


---
He was frequently met in the lanes by pedestrians and others without
 his seeing them, and by degrees
---
to talk about his method of combining work and play( such they
 considered), which, though probably convenient
 enough to himself,. 
---
his reading to be
---
Then a private
 resident of an adjoining place informed the local policeman that the
 baker's boy should not be allowed to read while driving, and. 
---
him fined for
 dangerous practices on the highway
---
The policeman thereupon lay in
 wait for Jude, and
---
one day accosted him and.


---
As Jude had
---
that he distributed later in the
 day
---
to get up at three o'clock in the morning to heat the
 oven, and mix and set in the bread, he was obliged immediately after laying
 the sponge;. 
---
if he could not read his classics on the highways

---
so that he could hardly study at all
---
To do
 that official justice, he did not put himself much in the way of
 Jude's bread- cart,.


---
that in such a lonely district the
 chief danger was to Jude himself, and often on seeing the white tilt
 over the hedges he would move in another direction
---
when Fawley was getting quite advanced,
---
On a day being now about
 sixteen, and had been stumbling through the" Carmen Sæ culare," on
 his way home, he found. 
---
himself to be passing over the high edge of
 the plateau by the Brown House
---
it was
 the sense of this which had caused him to look up. 
---
His mind had become
---
him to kneel on the ladder
---
so impregnated with the
 poem, he stopped the horse,
 knelt
 down on the roadside bank with open book. 
---
He turned first to the
 shiny goddess, who seemed to look so softly and critically at his
 doings, then to the disappearing luminary on the other hand,
---
as he
 began
---
till he had finished the hymn, which Jude
 repeated under the sway of a polytheistic fancy that he would never
 have thought of humouring in broad daylight
---
Reaching home, he mused over his curious superstition, innate or
 acquired, in doing this, and
---
The more he thought of it. 
---
the
 more convinced he was of his inconsistency
---
He began. 
---
whether he could be reading quite the right books for his object
 in life
---
Ultimately he decided. 
---
that in his sheer love of reading he had taken
 up a wrong emotion for a Christian young man
---
He had dabbled in
 Clarke's Homer, but. 
---
though he possessed a copy
---
He abandoned the now familiar Ionic for a
 new dialect, and
---
Moreover,
 on going into Alfredston one day, he was introduced to patristic
 literature by finding at the bookseller's some volumes of the
 Fathers which had been left behind by an insolvent clergyman of the
 neighbourhood.


---
he visited on Sundays all
 the churches within a walk
---
On one of these pilgrimages he
 met with a hunch- backed old woman of great intelligence, who read
 everything she could lay her hands on, and
---
he
 resolved as firmly as ever.


---
At present he had no income at all. 
---
He
 had no trade or calling of any dignity or stability whatever on which
 he could subsist while carrying out an intellectual labour which
 might spread over many years.


---
;
 for making the second he felt a distaste; the preparation of the
 third requisite he inclined to. 
---
; therefore he
 would learn. 
---
He thought of his unknown uncle, his cousin
 Susanna's father, an ecclesiastical worker in metal, and somehow
 mediæ
---
val art in any material was a trade for which he had rather a
 fancy. 
---
He could not go far wrong in following his uncle's footsteps,
 and.


---
As a preliminary he obtained some small blocks of freestone, metal
.


---
soon as he had found a substitute for himself in his aunt's little
 business
---
, he offered his services to this man for a trifling wage.

---
Here Jude had the opportunity of learning at least the rudiments of
 freestone- working. 
---
Some time later he went to a church- builder in
 the same place, and
---
that he was only following up this handicraft as
 a prop to lean on while he prepared those greater engines which
 he flattered himself would be better fitted for him
---
Not forgetting, he yet was
 interested in his pursuit on its own account. 
---
He now had lodgings
 during the week in the little town,
---
whence he returned to Marygreen
 village every Saturday evening. 
---
And thus he reached and.




---
At this memorable date of his life he was, one Saturday, about three o'clock in the afternoon.

---
he walked with his
 tools at his back,. 
---
his little chisels clinking faintly against the
 larger ones in his basket
---
It being the end of the week he had left
 work early, and had come out of the town by a round- about route which
 he did not usually frequent, having promised to call at a flour- mill
 near Cresscombe to execute a commission for his aunt.


---
He was in an enthusiastic mood. 
---
He seemed, and
. 
---
which he had dreamed so much
---
He might, of course, have gone there
 now, in some capacity or other, but
---
he preferred. 
---
than he could be said to

---
A warm self- content suffused him. 
---
when he considered

---
what he had already done
---
as he went along
---
Now and then he turned
. 
---
But he hardly
 saw them
---
; the act was an automatic repetition of what he had been
 accustomed to do when less occupied; and
---
which really
 engaged him
---
the one matter was the mental estimate of his progress thus far.


---
" I have acquired quite an average student's power to read the
 common ancient classics, Latin in particular." 
---
which enabled him with
 great ease to himself
---
" I have read two books of the_ Iliad_, besides being pretty familiar
 with passages such as the speech of Phoenix in the ninth book,
 the fight of Hector and Ajax in the fourteenth, the appearance of
 Achilles unarmed and his heavenly armour in the eighteenth, and the
 funeral games in the twenty- third.
---
I have also done some Hesiod, a
 little scrap of Thucydides, and a lot of the Greek Testament... 
---
I
 wish.


---
" I have done some mathematics, including the first six and the
 eleventh and twelfth books of Euclid; and algebra as far as simple
 equations.


---
" I know something of the Fathers, and something of Roman and English
 history.


---
But I shall not make much
 farther advance here, from the difficulty of getting books. 
---
Hence I
 must next concentrate all my energies on settling in Christminster.

---
I shall
---
I shall there

---
I must save money, and
---
I will; and
---
if I wait twenty years for the welcome
---
" I'll be D.D.!"


---
before I have done
---
And then he continued, and. 
---
he might become even a
 bishop by leading a pure, energetic, wise, Christian life
---
And what
 an example he would set! 
---
If his income were £5000 a year
---
, he would
 give away £4500 in one form and another, and. 
---
He would draw the line at an archdeacon. 
---
Perhaps a man
 could be as good and as learned and as useful in the capacity of
 archdeacon as in that of bishop. 
---
Yet he thought of the bishop again.


---
" Meanwhile I will read, as soon as I am settled in Christminster,
 the books I have not been able to get hold of here: Livy, Tacitus,
 Herodotus, Æschylus, Sophocles,
---
he did not notice them.

---
His thoughts went on:

"--Euripides, Plato, Aristotle, Lucretius, Epictetus, Seneca,
 Antoninus. 
---
Then I must master other things: the Fathers thoroughly;
 Bede and ecclesiastical history generally; a smattering of Hebrew-- I
!"


---
"--but I can work hard. 
---
I have staying power in abundance,
---
I'll be her beloved son, in whom she shall be well
 pleased."


---
In his deep concentration on these transactions of the future Jude's
 walk had slackened, and
---
he was now standing quite still,. 
---
and
 he became aware that a soft cold substance had been flung at him, and

---
A glance told him. 
---
had come the slight sounds of voices and
 laughter that had mingled with his dreams
---
He mounted the bank and

---
his attention had
---
that he was watching them
---
" Thank you!" said Jude severely.


---
", I tell you!"
---
Jude grew sarcastic, and.


---
as he wiped his face
---
he said to the up- stream one of the three.


---
whom he addressed
---
Jude was almost certain that to her was
 attributable the enterprise of attracting his attention from dreams
 of the humaner letters to what was simmering in the minds around him.


---
when he had said the words
---
that he had singled her out from the three, but
 in commonplace obedience to conjunctive orders from headquarters,

---
unconsciously received by unfortunate men
---
Jude was now aware that no message on any matter connected with her
 father's business had prompted her signal to him. 
---
He set down his
 basket of tools,. 
---
Jude, tossing back her
 missile, seemed.


---
" We are doing this for my father, who naturally does n't want anything
 thrown away. 
---
He makes that into dubbin." 
---
" Jude asked,
,.

" Impudence. 
---
though he had very large doubts as
 to its truth
---
" How can I? 
---
I do n't know your name.
---
Shall I tell it to you?"


---
I'm living here.
---
" I must have known it. 
---
if I had often come this way
---
But I mostly go
 straight along the high- road.
---
" My father is a pig- breeder, and
---
The
 unvoiced call of woman to man,, held Jude to the spot against his
 intention-- almost against his will, and in a way new to his
 experience. 
---
It is scarcely an exaggeration to say that till this
 moment Jude had never looked at a woman to consider her as such, but
 had vaguely regarded the sex as beings outside his life and purposes.

---
He gazed from her eyes to her mouth, thence to her bosom, and to her
 full round naked arms, wet,.


---
he murmured,.


---
he answered

". 
---
Jude felt, but. 
---
himself drifting strangely
---
" I do n't mind."


---
Jude being still unconscious of more than
 a general impression of her appearance
---
" he hazarded.

---
" Yes."

" Shall I call?"


---
Jude Fawley shouldered his tool- basket and. 
---
at which he mentally stood at gaze
---
He had

---
which had
 evidently been hanging round him
---
everywhere he went,
---
for he knew not
 how long, but
---
had somehow been divided from his actual breathing as
 by a sheet of glass
---
which he had so precisely formulated only a few minutes
 earlier
---
, he knew not
 how.


---
," he said to himself, faintly conscious
. 
---
that to common sense there was something lacking, and still more
 obviously something redundant in the nature of this girl who had
 drawn him to her which made it necessary that he should assert mere
 sportiveness on his part as his reason in seeking her-- something in
 her quite antipathetic to that side of him which had been occupied
 with literary study and the magnificent Christminster dream
---
who chose THAT missile for opening her attack on him
---
He saw this with his intellectual eye, just for a short fleeting
. 
---
Jude was lost to
 all conditions of things in the advent of a fresh and wild pleasure,
. 
---
that of having found a new channel for emotional interest hitherto
 unsuspected, though it had lain close beside him
---
He was.


---
he's nobody,
---
He used,. 
---
" I do n't know.  I wish I had thrown something else than that!"
 till he' prenticed
 himself at Alfredston
---
Since then he's been very stuck up, and

---
He wants
---
what he is
---
, he's as simple as a child. 
---
I could see it, when he looked at' ee. 
---
as if he had never seen a woman
 before in his born days
---
Well, he's."




---
The next day Jude Fawley was pausing in his bedroom with the sloping
 ceiling, looking at the books on the table, and then at the black
 mark on the plaster above them, made by the smoke of his lamp in past
 months.


---
It was Sunday afternoon, four- and- twenty hours after his meeting with
 Arabella Donn. 
---
During the whole bygone week he had been resolving to
,--
---
He was proud of the book,

---
he had never done before.


---
He had anticipated much pleasure in this afternoon's reading, under
 the quiet roof of his great- aunt's house as formerly, where he now
 slept only two nights a week. 
---
But a new thing, a great hitch, had
 happened yesterday in the gliding and noiseless current of his life,
 and
---
he felt.


---
He would not go out. 
---
He sat down,:


    HÊ KAINÊ DIATHÊKÊ



---
Had he promised? 
---
Surely he had! 
---
He ought. 
---
Even though he had

---
only Sundays and week- day evenings for reading he could afford one
 afternoon,. 
---
that other young men afforded so many
---
After
 to- day he would never probably see her again. 
---
what his plans were
---
In short, as if materially, a compelling arm of extraordinary
 muscular power seized hold of him-- something which had nothing in
 common with the spirits and influences that had moved him hitherto.

---
he has seized by the collar
---
whose life had nothing in common with his own except
 locality
---
the predestinate Jude
 sprang up and across the room. 
---
he had

---
Foreseeing such an event already arrayed himself in his best clothes. 
---
In three minutes he was
 out of the house and descending by the path across the wide vacant
 hollow of corn- ground which lay between the village and the isolated
 house of Arabella in the dip beyond the upland.


---
As he walked
---
he looked at his watch. 
---
He could be back in two hours,
 easily, and
---
a good long time would still remain to him for reading
 after tea.


---
where the path
 joined the highway he hastened along, and
---
Here at the base of the chalk formation he neared the brook
 that oozed from it, and. 
---
till he reached her
 dwelling
---
He entered the garden, and.


---
Somebody had seen him through the window, for a male voice on the
 inside
---
Here's your young man come coorting! 
---
Jude winced at the words. 
---
was the last thing he was thinking
 of. 
---
He was going,; but
---
he entered,.


---
" Take a chair, Mr. What's- your- name?" said her father, an energetic,
 black- whiskered man, in the same businesslike tones Jude had heard
 from outside.


---
" I'd rather go out at once,
---
" Yes," said he. 
---
that had hitherto
 haunted him
---
Then
 they bore off to the left along the crest into the ridgeway, which
 they followed till it intersected the high- road at the Brown
 House aforesaid, the spot of his former fervid desires to behold
 Christminster. 
---
But he forgot them now. 
---
He talked the commonest
 local twaddle to Arabella with greater zest than he would have felt
 in discussing all the philosophies with all the Dons in the recently
 adored university, and. 
---
where he had knelt to Diana
 and Phoebus
---
Jude, the incipient scholar,
 prospective D.D., professor, bishop, or what not, felt wench in agreeing to take a walk with him in her Sunday frock and
 ribbons.


---
himself
 honoured and
---
They reached the Brown House barn-- the point at which he had planned
 to turn back. 
---
which had grown up in Jude's bosom
---
The tenderness left him no will to
 thwart her inclination now-- which pleased him in affording him excuse
 for a longer time with her. 
---
The maid- servant recognized Jude, and

---
The
 whole aspect of the scene had that depressing effect on Jude which
 few places can produce like a tap- room on a Sunday evening when
 the setting sun is slanting in, and
---
the
 unfortunate wayfarer finds himself with no other haven of rest.


---
Jude by this time wished; but
---
he was out of such an
 uncongenial atmosphere
---
he ordered the beer, which was promptly
 brought.


---
Jude tasted. 
---
he asked. 
---
" I do n't
 understand beer very much now
---
I like it well enough,
 but
---
I find coffee better. 
---
" Adulterated-- I ca n't touch it!" 
---
he said good- humouredly.


---
why he did not put his
 arm round her waist
---
he did not
---
; he merely said:."


---
He felt the warmth of
 her body against his, and.


---
" he observed.


---
" he was thinking.


---
they were nearly run into by two men who had been
 walking on the grass unseen.


---
," said one of the men as
.


---
Jude took the
 hint, and.


---
, said Jude
 to himself. 
---
he kissed her again. 
---
he kissed her once more.


---
He had left his cottage
 at half- past three,. 
---
when, with another
 embrace, he stood
---
He gave
 way, and. 
---
he
 found, in addition to her parents,
---
They did not belong to his set or circle, and
---
he felt out of place
 and embarrassed. 
---
He had not meant this: a mere afternoon of
 pleasant walking with Arabella, that was all he had meant. 
---
He did

---
But that sense was only temporary: Arabella soon re- asserted her
 sway in his soul. 
---
He walked. 
---
as if he felt
---
himself to be another man
 from the Jude of yesterday
---
What were his books to him?
---
what were
 his intentions
---
that: he was just living for the first
 time:
---
When he got back to the house his aunt had gone to bed, and
---
a general
 consciousness of his neglect seemed. 
---
He went upstairs without a light, and
---
the dim
 interior of his room accosted him with sad inquiry. 
---
There lay his
 book open,
---
just as he had left it, and
---
the capital letters on the
 title- page regarded him with fixed reproach in the grey starlight,
 like the unclosed eyes of a dead man:


   
---
HÊ KAINÊ DIATHÊKÊ


     *    *    *    *    *    *


 Jude had; and
---
it was with a sense of futility that he threw into his
 basket upon his tools and other necessaries the unread book he had
 brought with him.


---
He kept his impassioned doings a secret almost from himself.

---
he had followed a few hours
 earlier under cover of darkness
---
Retracing by the light of dawn the road, with his sweetheart by his side, he
 reached the bottom of the hill, where he walked slowly, and stood
 still. 
---
He was on the spot where he had given her the first kiss. 
---
Jude looked on the ground and. 
---
He looked
 closely, and. 
---
" the embroidery of imagination upon the stuff of
 nature" so depicted her past presence that a void was in his heart
 which nothing could fill. 
---
before he could
 see her again
---
as he had promised
---
Utter annihilation of the six days would have been his intensest wish
.


---
if he had had only the week to live
---
And what did he tell' ee next?"


---
" Then he said--" 
---
If Jude had been behind the fence he would have

---
how very few of his sayings
 and doings on the previous evening were private
---
him to care for' ee a bit
---
him to care for me: yes
---
him to have me--
---
He's the sort of man I long
 for. 
---
As he is a romancing, straightfor'ard, honest chap
---
", he's,
 and as a husband, if you set about catching him in the right way."


---
he do n't go too far
---
how do you mean-- a sure way to gain a man? 
---
that's honourable and serious- minded such as he
---
he ISN'T honourable
---
Besides, you make sure that he's
 honourable before you begin. 
---
Jude was as usual walking out to his aunt's at
 Marygreen from his lodging in Alfredston, a walk which now had large
 attractions for him quite other than his desire to see his aged and
 morose relative. 
---
He diverged to the right before ascending the hill
 with the single purpose of gaining, on his way, a glimpse of Arabella
 that should not come into the reckoning of regular appointments.

---
Before quite reaching the homestead his alert eye perceived the top
 of her head.

---
Entering the gate he found. 
---
" They were drove from Spaddleholt
 Farm only yesterday, where Father bought'em at a stiff price enough.

---
There are no men
 folk at home, only Mother, and."


---
He set himself, and. 
---
when he caught her for a moment and
---
He plunged
 through a hole in the garden hedge, and into the lane.


---
" He'll be lost' n
---
Occasionally they
 would shout to some boy, but
---
he always wriggled
 past and.


---
" Let," said Jude. 
---
By this time the pig had reached an unfastened gate admitting to the
 open down, across which he sped with all the agility his little legs
 afforded. 
---
From this
 summit he could be seen as a minute speck,.


---
" He'll be there. 
---
he's not lost or
---
Oh dear, how hot I
 be!"


---
Oh, I ask pardon
---
-- I nearly threw you down
---
", did n't I! 
---
But I am so
 tired!"


---
He reclined on his elbow near her.


---
" I'm blown too. 
---
Nobody could be nearer than a mile
 to them without their seeing him. 
---
But Jude did not think of
 that then.


---
" Oh, I can see such a pretty thing up this tree
---
" Where?" said Jude,.


---
You ca n't see him there
---
He bent nearer and. 
---
," he said.


---
I do n't see it
---
"," he repeated, the back of his head against her
 cheek. 
---
" But I can, perhaps, standing up." 
---
He stood accordingly,
.


---
" he replied. 
---
" I want. 
---
I've been waiting to ever so long!"


---
remained a moment looking deedily aslant
 at him; then with a slight curl of the lip sprang to her feet, and
!".

---
" I must mizzle
---
Jude followed and.


---
he coaxed.


---
Jude followed her
 like a pet lamb. 
---
if
 he tried
---
Thus they descended
 to the precincts of her father's homestead, and
---
," Jude said to
 himself,.


---
as he withdrew with a sigh and
---
Her father was, and
---
I zeed
---
I hope'?"


---
" He's for Christminster."


---
, I hear, as soon as he can get there
---
But it has been known a long time that it is his plan. 
---
well: he must walk about with
 somebody,
---
I s'pose. 
---
Young men do n't mean much now- a- days.'
---
He's shy; and
---
him slip through my
 fingers,
---
Jude assented. 
---
as he was near her
---
So long he minded little where he
 was. 
---
he said lingeringly:". 
---
I wo n't
 come in
---
" Certainly," said Jude with alacrity, the case being unexpectedly
 altered.


---
Did he want any tea? 
---
: he
 would rather sit and. 
---
," he said,.


---
when I had put the egg down
---
before he could quite reach her

---
Jude making a plunge for
 it and
---
he flushed also
---
till he rose and
---
, whither Jude rushed at her heels.




---
before he left her
---
" I am going away," he said to her. 
---
" I think. 
---
I ought
---
I think

---
I wish! 
---
I was much to blame,
---
I know. 
---
" What?" he asked,. "
---
And what shall I do?
---
" I have
---
" Well then--"

 next to no wages as yet or perhaps I should have
 thought of this before... 
---
I could dream of doing
---
I thought-- deary
---
I thought,
---
Of course I never dreamt six months ago, or even
 three, of marrying. 
---
I mean
 my plans before I knew you, my dear. 
---
That night he went out alone, and.

---
He knew well, too well, in the secret centre of his brain,.

---
as he
 unfortunately had done
---
Yet, such being the custom of the rural districts among honourable
 young men, he was ready to abide by what he had said,
 and take the consequences. 
---
For his own soothing he kept up a
 factitious belief in her. 
---
His idea of her was the thing of most
 consequence, not Arabella herself
---
, he sometimes said laconically.


---
what a simple fool young Fawley was
---
All his
 reading had only come to this,. 
---
that he would have
---
that it was the sort of
 conduct they would have expected of such an honest young man as Jude
 in reparation of the wrong he had done his innocent sweetheart
---
that it was the last thing she could do for him, poor silly
 fellow
---
, he had gone underground years before with his
 father and mother. 
---
He, a stone- mason's
 apprentice, nineteen years of age, was working for half wages. 
---
till
 he should be out of his time
---
him to take a lonely roadside cottage between
 the Brown House and Marygreen, that he might have the profits of a
 vegetable garden, and utilize her past experiences by letting her
 keep a pig
---
But it was not the sort of life he had bargained for,
 and
---
; that was the thing-- a husband with a lot
 of earning power in him for buying her frocks and hats when he should
 begin to get frightened a bit, and stick to his trade, and throw
 aside those stupid books for practical undertakings.


---
So to the cottage he took her on the evening of the marriage,.


---
which he had bought her
---
he said, with a sudden distaste for her.


---
But in town the men expect more,
 and
---
when I was
---
" Well, not exactly barmaid-- I used
---
I bought it just for a fancy.

---
Jude thought with a feeling of sickness. 
---
that he knew
---
he resolved to

---
Mrs. Jude Fawley was walking in the streets of
 Alfredston one market- day with this quality in her carriage.


---
" I knew. 
---
it would with such as him
---
He's a dear good fellow,
 and
---
I am
---
"," said Mrs. Fawley quietly.


---
" I was mistaken."


---
I never thought beyond bringing about the
 real thing-- not that one could sham it!"


---
I did n't know."


---
he be in a taking! 
---
He'll give it to' ee o' Saturday
 nights! 
---
, he'll say!"


---
" I'll own to the first, but not to the second...
---
He'll be glad I was wrong in what I said. 
---
He'll shake down,
 bless' ee
---
-- men always do. 
---
they were in their
 chamber in the lonely cottage by the wayside to which Jude walked
 home from his work every day. 
---
He had worked hard the whole twelve
 hours, and. 
---
as he lay
---
One action of hers, however, brought him to full cognition. 
---
, he could perceive a curious accomplishment of which she was
 mistress,. 
---
It seemed to him for
 the first time that the dimples were far oftener absent from her face
 during his intercourse with her nowadays than they had been in the
 earlier weeks of their acquaintance.


---
he said suddenly. 
---
-- I do n't like."


---
" Lord, I did n't know!"
---
" Most men think otherwise."


---
what most men think
---
that you had always lived in
 your father's house
---
He sat bolt upright in bed and. 
---
He gave the answer simply, and; and
---
When Jude awoke the next morning
---
he seemed. 
---
As to the point in question he was compelled
---
to
 accept her word; in the circumstances he could not have acted
. 
---
There seemed to him, vaguely and dimly, something wrong in a social
 ritual which made necessary a cancelling of well- formed schemes
 involving years of thought and labour, of foregoing a man's one
 opportunity of showing himself superior to the lower animals, and of
 contributing his units of work to the general progress of his
 generation, because of a momentary surprise by a new and transitory
 instinct which had nothing in it of the nature of vice, and could be
 only at the most called weakness. 
---
He was, or
---
what he
 had done
---
that he deserved if not her also, for the rest of a
 lifetime
---
which would cripple him,
---
There was perhaps something fortunate in the fact that the
 immediate reason of his marriage had proved to be non- existent.

X


 The time arrived for killing the pig which Jude and his wife had
 fattened in their sty during the autumn months, and the butchering
.


---
that Jude might get to Alfredston without losing more than a quarter
 of a day
---
Jude looked out of the window
 long before dawn, and
---
," he said to
 Arabella.


---
" Oh, he'll come. 
---
Challow to scald him
---
Though I like singeing best."


---
I'll get up
---
"," said Jude. 
---
I like the way of my own county."


---
He went downstairs,
---
though for him the sense of
 cheerfulness was lessened by thoughts on the reason of that blaze-- to
 heat water
---
He's

---
The snow is not enough to
 hinder him, surely!"


---
He ate the
 last.
---
What has he lived on since?
---
" What-- he has been starving?"


---
" That accounts for his crying so. 
---
However, his basket
 o' knives and things have been already sent on here, and
---
"," said Jude. 
---
" I'll do it,."


---
He went out to the sty,. 
---
while Jude
 held him
---
" Upon my soul I would sooner have gone without the pig!"
---
than have had
 this to do said Jude. 
---
I have fed with my own hands
---
" I'll stick him effectually,. 
---
that he must die slow
---
I was brought
 up to it, and
---
I know. 
---
He ought."


---
He shall not be half a minute
---
if I can help it
---
"," said Jude determinedly. 
---
as he had seen
---
Scraping the bristles from the pig's
 upturned throat,, he slit the fat;

---
that ever I should say it
---
And I telling you!"


---
his glazing eyes riveting themselves on
 Arabella with the eloquently keen reproach of a creature recognizing
 at last the treachery of those who had seemed his only friends
---
Jude had flung it
---
his dying breath coming
 through the hole
---
said he.


---
"; now he'll go
---
The last plunge had come so unexpectedly, and
 in recovering himself he kicked over the vessel in which the blood
 had been caught.


---
Jude put the pail upright, but
---
The lips and
 nostrils of the animal turned livid, then white, and the muscles of
 his limbs relaxed.


---
Jude said. 
---
" He's dead."


---
to do with such a messy job as a pig- killing I
 should like!
---
",," said he. 
---
" I do n't scold you."


---
I could n't have carried it out much
 better myself,!" 
---
if I could
---
Challow expressed his contrition. 
---
he said,
---
Jude too laughed, but
---
there was a strong flavour of bitterness in
 his amusement.


---
Challow made up for his neglect of the killing by zeal in the
 scalding and scraping. 
---
Jude felt dissatisfied with himself as a man
 at what he had done, though aware of his lack of common sense, and

---
The white snow, stained with the blood of his fellow- mortal,
 wore an illogical look to him as a lover of justice,; but
---
he could not see. 
---
he was
---
He did not like the road to Alfredston now. 
---
It stared him cynically
 in the face. 
---
The wayside objects reminded him so much of his
 courtship of his wife
---
that, to keep them out of his eyes, he
 read. 
---
whenever he could
---
as he walked to and from his work
---
Yet
 he sometimes felt,
---
that by caring for books he was not escaping
 common- place nor
---
on which he had

---
he one day heard voices
---
just as he had
 done at that earlier time
---
himself being the
 subject of discourse,
---
possibly because they had seen him in the
 distance
---
They were quite unaware that the shed- walls were so thin
 that he could hear their words as he passed.


---
so that he should
 make
---
it rankled in his mind so much.


---
that instead of
 entering his own cottage,
---
when he reached it
---
he flung his basket
 inside the garden- gate and
---
This made his arrival home rather late. 
---
what he
 had heard
---
lest should lead him
---
he
 spoke little
---
the book sticking out of
 his pocket she added that he ought to earn more
---
" I'll declare afore Heaven that I thought what I told you.
" I do n't mean that," he said hastily. 
---
" I mean before that time.

---
I know; but
---
I insist
 upon you telling me."


---
And he hinted gently.

---
what had been revealed to him
---
" But I do n't wish. 
---
if no lifelong penalty attached
 to it for the man, or,
---
in his default, for herself; if the weakness
 of the moment could end with the moment, or even with the year.

---
if he is honest
---
if he is otherwise
---
Jude's dear ancient classics on a table to have
 been laid. 
---
" Leave my books alone!" he said. 
---
Somehow, in going so, he loosened the fastening of her hair,
 and
---
Jude relinquished his hold, and
---
than he had caused
---
dressed in their holiday
 clothes; they were mainly lovers-- such pairs as Jude and Arabella

---
how he's served me
---
Jude was exasperated, and.

---
Then he suddenly lost his heat. 
---
he,
 her husband stood still,. 
---
, he
 thought;
---
as your father ill- used your
 mother, and
---
your father's sister ill- used her husband?
---
Jude fixed an arrested, surprised look on her. 
---
He left the spot, and,
. 
---
Here he called upon his great- aunt, whose infirmities
 daily increased.


---
said Jude abruptly,.


---
Your father and mother could n't get on together, and
---
your
 father went away with you to South Wessex, and."


---
Jude recalled his father's silence about North Wessex and Jude's
 mother,.


---
" It was the same with your father's sister. 
---
Her husband offended
 her, and
---
" Where did Father and Mother part-- by the Brown House, did you say?
---
In the dusk of that evening Jude walked away from his old aunt's as
. 
---
as he reached the open down
---
But as soon he struck out
 upon it. 
---
till he came to a large round pond
---
Jude put one foot on the edge of the
 ice, and then the other: it cracked under his weight; but this did
 not deter him. 
---
He ploughed his way inward to the centre, the ice
 making sharp noises as he went. 
---
When just about the middle he looked
 around him and. 
---
he did
 not go down. 
---
He jumped again, but
---
Jude
 went back to the edge, and.


---
, he thought. 
---
What was he reserved for? 
---
He supposed

---
he was not a sufficiently dignified person for suicide. 
---
Peaceful
 death abhorred him as a subject, and.


---
What could he do of a lower kind than self- extermination
---
He could get drunk. 
---
; he had forgotten.

---
He began. 
---
why some men boozed at inns
---
He
 struck down the hill northwards and.

---
him to recognize the place as that he
 had visited with Arabella on that first Sunday evening of their
 courtship
---
He called for liquor and.


---
Staggering homeward late that night, with all his sense of
 depression gone, and his head fairly clear still, he began. 
---
when he entered
---
in
 his stumbling state it was some time.

---
before he could get a light
---
Then he found.

---
written by his wife on the inside of an old envelope
---
All the next day he remained at home, and. 
---
He then cleaned up the premises,.


---
when he again plodded home
---
At night he found. 
---
He was such
 a slow old coach, and
---
There was no prospect of his ever bettering himself or her.

---
as he knew,
---
if he had no
 objection
---
Jude replied. 
---
that he had not the least objection to her going
---
He
 thought it a wise course,. 
---
He enclosed in the packet containing
 the letter the money that had been realized by the sale of the pig,
 with all he had besides,.


---
From that day he heard no more of her except indirectly,. 
---
though her
 father and his household did not immediately leave, but
---
till
 his goods and other effects had been sold off
---
When Jude learnt
.


---
he packed
 his own household goods into a waggon, and
---
He then went into lodgings at Alfredston, and.

---
He noted its date, which came and passed without Jude's going near
 the place, or perceiving that the traffic out of Alfredston by
 the southern road was materially increased by the auction. 
---
A few
 days later he entered a dingy broker's shop in the main street
 of the town, and
---
, he perceived a framed photograph, which turned out to be
 his own portrait.


---
It was one which he had had specially taken and framed by a local man
 in bird's- eye maple, as a present for Arabella, and. 
---
him look at this and the other articles
 in the heap, and not perceiving that the portrait was of himself
---
as brought
 home to him by this mute and undesigned evidence of her sale of
 his portrait and gift
---
The utter death of every tender sentiment in his wife,, was the conclusive little stroke required
 to demolish all sentiment in him. 
---
He paid the shilling,.


---
when he
 reached his lodging
---
Two or three days later he heard. 
---
He had sent a message offering to see her for a formal
 leave- taking, but
---
when his day's work was done
---
On the evening
 following their emigration,, he came out
 of doors after supper, and. 
---
He could not realize himself. 
---
On the old track he seemed. 
---
when he had stood
---
," he said. 
---
" I have
 a wife. 
---
More, I have arrived at the still riper stage of having
 disagreed with her,."


---
He remembered then.


---
that he was standing not far from the spot at
 which the parting between his father and his mother was said to have
 occurred
---
A little further on was the summit whence Christminster, or what he
 had taken for that city
---
Jude drew near it, and

---
He remembered.

---
that
 once on his way home he had proudly cut with his keen new chisel an
 inscription on the back of that milestone,
---
It had been done in the first week of his apprenticeship,. 
---
before
 he had been diverted from his purposes by an unsuitable woman
---
He
 wondered. 
---
By the light of a match
 he could still discern
---
what he had cut so enthusiastically so long

---
ago:


             THITHER
              J. F.
   [ with a pointing finger]


 The sight of it, unimpaired, within its screen of grass and nettles,
 lit in his soul a spark of the old fire. 
---
Surely his plan should
 be? 
---
even though he did see uglinesses in the world
---
he had heard
---
which to be the
 philosophy of one Spinoza might be his own even now.


---
He might battle with his evil star, and.


---
By moving to a spot a little way off he uncovered the horizon in a
 north- easterly direction. 
---
It was enough for him. 
---
He would go to Christminster as soon as the
 term of his apprenticeship expired.


---
He returned to his lodgings in a better mood, and.

Part Second


 AT CHRISTMINSTER



   " Save his own soul
---
he hath no star."--
---
I


 The next noteworthy move in Jude's life was that in which he appeared
 gliding steadily onward through a dusky landscape of some three
 years' later leafage than had graced his courtship of Arabella,
 and the disruption of his coarse conjugal life with her. 
---
He was

---
He had at last found himself clear of Marygreen and Alfredston
---
: he
 was out of his apprenticeship, and.


---
, barring
 the interruption involved in his intimacy and married experience with
 Arabella, he had been looking forward for about ten years
---
Jude would now have been described as a young man with a forcible,
 meditative, and earnest rather than handsome cast of countenance.

---
He was of dark complexion, with dark harmonizing eyes, and
---
he wore
 a closely trimmed black beard of more advanced growth than is usual
 at his age
---
; this, with his great mass of black curly hair, was some
 trouble to him in combing and washing out the stone- dust that settled
 on it in the pursuit of his trade. 
---
His capabilities in the latter,
 having been acquired in the country, were of an all- round sort,
 including monumental stone- cutting, gothic free- stone work for the
 restoration of churches, and carving of a general kind. 
---
In London
 he would probably have become specialized and
---
He had that afternoon driven in a cart from Alfredston to the village
 nearest the city in this direction, and.


---
himself arriving thus
---
The ultimate impulse to come had had a curious origin-- one more
 nearly related to the emotional side of him than to the intellectual,
. 
---
One day while in lodgings at
 Alfredston he had gone to Marygreen, and. 
---
He had asked. 
---
But it haunted him; and

---
He now paused at the top of a crooked and gentle declivity,
 and. 
---
he moved along the level way between pollard
 willows growing indistinct in the twilight
---
that caught his strained gaze in his days
 of dreaming
---
They winked their yellow eyes at him
 dubiously, and
---
though they had been awaiting him all these
 years in disappointment at his tarrying
---
as if,, they did not much want him
 now.


---
He was a species of Dick Whittington whose spirit was touched to
 finer issues than a mere material gain. 
---
He went along the outlying
 streets with the cautious tread of an explorer. 
---
He saw nothing of
 the real city in the suburbs on this side. 
---
he scrutinized carefully such localities. 
---
he demanded
---
after inquiry took a room in a suburb nicknamed" Beersheba,"
 though he did not know this at the time
---
Here he installed himself,
 and.


---
he
 opened under a lamp a map he had brought. 
---
he could see enough to decide on the direction he
 should take to reach the heart of the place.


---
After many turnings he came up to the first ancient medi
---
that he had encountered. 
---
as he could see by the
 gateway
---
He entered it,. 
---
then he began. 
---
When he
 passed objects out of harmony with its general expression he allowed
 his eyes to slip over them as if he did not see them.


---
he listened till a hundred- and- one strokes
. 
---
He must have made a mistake
---
, he thought:.


---
he could no longer get into the
 quadrangles
---
, he rambled under the walls and doorways,. 
---
still he serpentined
 among the shadows,? 
---
for had he not imagined these scenes through
 ten bygone years, and
---
Down obscure alleys, apparently
 never trodden now by the foot of man, and
---
Knowing not a human being here, Jude began to be impressed with
 the isolation of his own personality, as with a self- spectre,. 
---
the
 sensation being that of one who walked but could not make himself
 seen or heard
---
He drew his breath pensively, and,.


---
During the interval of preparation for this venture, since his wife
 and furniture's uncompromising disappearance into space, he had read
 and. 
---
learnt by one in his
 position
---
Some of them, by the accidents of his reading, loomed out in
 his fancy disproportionately large by comparison with the rest. 
---
as if he
 ran against them without feeling their bodily frames
---
The streets were now deserted, but on account of these things he
 could not go in. 
---
There were poets abroad, of early date and of late,
 from the friend and eulogist of Shakespeare down to him who has
 recently passed into silence, and that musical one of the tribe who
 is still among us. 
---
Speculative philosophers drew along, not always
 with wrinkled foreheads and hoary hair as in framed portraits, but
 the well- known
 three, the enthusiast, the poet, and the formularist, the echoes
 of whose teachings had influenced him even in his obscure home.

---
pink- faced, slim, and active as in youth; modern divines sheeted in
 their surplices, among whom the most real to Jude Fawley
---
A start of aversion appeared in his fancy.


---
He regarded the statesmen in their various types, men of firmer
 movement and less dreamy air; the scholar, the speaker, the plodder;
 the man whose mind grew with his growth in years, and the man whose
 mind contracted with the same.


---
The scientists and philologists followed on in his mind- sight in
 an odd impossible combination, men of meditative faces, strained
 foreheads, and weak- eyed as bats with constant research;
 then official characters-- such men as governor- generals and
 lord- lieutenants, in whom he took little interest; chief- justices and
 lord chancellors, silent thin- lipped figures of whom he knew barely
 the names. 
---
Of them he had an ample band-- some men of
 heart, others rather men of head; he who apologized for the Church
 in Latin; the saintly author of the Evening Hymn; and near them the
 great itinerant preacher, hymn- writer, and zealot, shadowed like Jude
 by his matrimonial difficulties.


---
Jude found;. 
---
himself speaking out loud, holding conversations with
 them, like an actor in a melodrama who apostrophizes the
 audience on the other side of the footlights
---
till he suddenly ceased
 with a start at his absurdity
---
Perhaps those incoherent words of the
 wanderer were heard within the walls by some student or thinker over
 his lamp; and
---
he may have raised his head, and. 
---
Jude now perceived.


---
that,, he had the whole aged city to himself with the exception
 of a belated townsman here and there, and
---
that he seemed
---
A voice reached him out of the shade; a real and local voice:


---
" You've been a- settin' a long time on that plinth- stone, young man.

---
It came from a policeman who had been observing Jude without the
 latter observing him.


---
Jude went home and to bed, after reading up a little about these men
 and their several messages to the world from a book or two that he
 had brought with him concerning the sons of the university. 
---
As he
 drew towards sleep various memorable words of theirs that he had

---
though
 Jude did not remember this)
---
Another voice was that of the Corn Law convert, whose phantom he had
 just seen in the quadrangle with a great bell. 
---
Jude thought, but
---
his soul
 might have been shaping the historic words of his master- speech:

" Sir, I may be wrong
---
that there should be free access to the food of man from
 whatever quarter it may come
---
he had seen just now
---
He likewise heard
---
Jude fell asleep:


     
---
He did not wake till morning. 
---
He started up in bed,
---
He
 had, and;
---
Passing out into the streets on this errand he found
---
The
 spirits of the great men had disappeared.


---
he read, naturally,
 less as an artist- critic of their forms than as an artizan and
 comrade of the dead handicraftsmen whose muscles had actually
 executed those forms
---
He examined the mouldings,.


---
, he perceived,
---
The condition of several moved him
. 
---
as he would have been moved by maimed sentient beings
---
The rottenness of these historical documents reminded him. 
---
that he was
 not, after all,
---
as he
 had intended
---
He had come, and, and
---
that in a place of crumbling stones there must be plenty for one of
 his trade to do in the business of renovation
---
He asked his way to
 the workyard of the stone- mason whose name had been given him at
 Alfredston; and.


---
he had

---
He asked for the foreman, and. 
---
For a moment there fell on Jude a true illumination
---
But he
 lost it under stress of his old idea. 
---
He would accept any employment
 which might be offered him on the strength of his late employer's
 recommendation; but
---
he would accept it as a provisional thing only.

---
This was his form of the modern vice of unrest.


---
Moreover he perceived. 
---
he fancied
---
He did
---
not at that time see; that other
 developments were shaping in the world around him,. 
---
what he held in
 reverence
---
The deadly animosity
 of contemporary logic and vision towards so much of was not yet revealed to him.


---
Having failed to obtain work here as yet he went away, and. 
---
he seemed
---
How he wished! 
---
he
 had that pretty portrait of her
---
At last he wrote to his aunt to
. 
---
that he was not to

---
Jude, a ridiculously affectionate fellow, promised
 nothing,
---
put the photograph on the mantel- piece, kissed it-- he did
 not know why-- and. 
---
It was cheering-- the one thing uniting him to
 the emotions of the living city.


---
But he could not possibly hunt up such a respectable man just yet;
. 
---
so precarious were his
 fortunes
---
Thus he still remained in loneliness. 
---
Although people
 moved round him
---
he virtually saw none. 
---
Not as yet having mingled
 with the active life of the place it was largely non- existent to him.

---
on which the past is deeply graven he heard that
 past announcing itself with an emphasis altogether unsuspected by,
 and even incredible to, the habitual residents
---
For many days he haunted the cloisters and quadrangles of the
 colleges at odd minutes in passing them,. 
---
surprised by impish
 echoes of his own footsteps, smart as the blows of a mallet
---
The
 Christminster" sentiment,", ate further and
 further into him;.


---
till he probably knew more about those buildings
 materially, artistically, and historically, than any one of their
 inmates
---
when he found himself actually on the spot of
 his enthusiasm,
---
that Jude perceived how far away from the object of
 that enthusiasm he really was
---
Only a wall divided him from those
 happy young contemporaries of his with whom he shared a common mental
 life
---
as he went in search of labour
---
Every day, every hour,, he saw,. 
---
Yet he was as far from them. 
---
as if he had been at the
 antipodes
---
Of course he was. 
---
He was a young workman in a white
 blouse, and
---
with stone- dust in the creases of his clothes; and in
 passing him they did not even see him, or.

---
Whatever they were to him
---
, he to them was not on the spot at all; and
 yet
---
he had fancied.


---
he would be close to their lives by coming there
---
if he could only be so
 fortunate as to get into good employment
---
he would put up with the
 inevitable. 
---
So he thanked God for his health and strength, and. 
---
For the present he was outside the gates of everything
---
perhaps some day he would be inside
---
Those
 palaces of light and leading; he might some day look down on the
 world through their panes.


---
At length he did receive a message from the stone- mason's yard-- that
 a job was waiting for him. 
---
It was his first encouragement, and
---
he
 closed with the offer promptly.


---
He was young and strong, or
---
he never could have executed with such
 zest the undertakings to which he now applied himself, since they
 involved reading most of the night after working all the day. 
---
First
 he bought a shaded lamp for four and six- pence, and. 
---
Then he got pens, paper, and such other necessary books. 
---
as he
 had been unable to obtain elsewhere
---
Then, to the consternation of
 his landlady, he shifted all the furniture of his room-- a single one
 for living and sleeping-- rigged up a curtain on a rope across the
 middle, to make a double chamber out of one, hung up a thick blind
 that nobody should know how he was curtailing the hours of sleep,
 laid out his books, and sat down.


---
Having been deeply encumbered by marrying, getting a cottage, and
 buying the furniture which had disappeared in the wake of his wife
---
,
 he had never been able to save any money since the time of those
 disastrous ventures, and
---
till his wages began
---
to come in he was
 obliged. 
---
After buying a book or two
 he could not even afford himself a fire; and
---
he sat over his lamp in
 a great- coat, hat, and woollen gloves.


---
From his window he could perceive the spire of the cathedral, and the
 ogee dome under which resounded the great bell of the city. 
---
he could also get a glimpse of by going to the staircase.

---
he used as stimulants
---
when his faith in the future was

---
Like enthusiasts in general he made no inquiries into details of
 procedure. 
---
Picking up general notions from casual acquaintance, he
 never dwelt upon them. 
---
For the present, he said to himself,. 
---
His desire absorbed him, and.


---
At this time he received a nervously anxious letter from his poor old
 aunt, on the subject which had previously distressed her-- a fear that
 Jude would not be strong- minded enough to keep away from his cousin
 Sue Bridehead and her relations. 
---
Sue's father, his aunt believed,

---
( Miss Drusilla
 Fawley was of her date, Evangelical.)


---
As Jude was rather on an intellectual track than a theological
---
, this
 news of Sue's probable opinions did not much influence him one way
---
he walked at his earliest spare
 minutes past the shops answering to his great- aunt's description
---
He ventured, and. 
---
his purchase lingered on the
 scene
---
He felt very shy of looking at the girl in the desk
---
pretty that he could not believe it possible that she should belong
 to him. 
---
he recognized in the accents certain qualities of his
 own voice;, but his own. 
---
He stole a glance round. 
---
the single word


    A L L E L U J A


" A sweet, saintly, Christian business, hers!" thought he.


---
her skill in
 work of this sort having no doubt been acquired from her father's
 occupation as an ecclesiastical worker in metal
---
He came out. 
---
it seemed scarcely honourable towards his aunt. 
---
So Jude gave no sign. 
---
He would not call upon Sue just yet. 
---
He had
 other reasons against doing so. 
---
when he had walked away
---
particularly when he had told her that
 unpleasant part of his history which had resulted in his becoming
 enchained to one of her own sex whom she would certainly not admire
---
Thus he kept watch over her, and.

---
The consciousness of her living presence stimulated him. 
---
Between two and three weeks afterwards Jude was engaged with some
 more men, outside Crozier College in Old- time Street, in getting a
 block of worked freestone from a waggon across the pavement, before
 hoisting it to the parapet which they were repairing. 
---
the head man said," Spaik when he heave!
---
as he lifted
---
All of a sudden,, his cousin stood close to his elbow,
. 
---
His closeness to her was so suggestive that he trembled, and. 
---
He could
 perceive.


---
he continued his work,. 
---
He had
 been so caught by her influence that he had taken no count of her
 general mould and build. 
---
He remembered now.

---
That was about all he had seen. 
---
How could one of his cross- grained, unfortunate,
 almost accursed stock, have contrived? 
---
, he supposed.


---
which had been accumulating in his
 breast as the bottled- up effect of solitude and the poetized
 locality he dwelt in
---
he perceived.


---
that, whatever his obedient
 wish in a contrary direction, he would soon be unable to resist the
 desire to make himself known to her
---
He affected.


---
why he should not and
---
that he was
---
: even were he free,
---
The third in a family like his own a blood- relation would
 duplicate the adverse conditions, and
---
Therefore, again, he would have;. 
---
But under the various deterrent influences Jude's instinct was, and
---
the next Sunday he went to the morning
 service in the Cathedral church of Cardinal College,.


---
for he had found
---
he awaited her in the afternoon, which was
 finer. 
---
He knew
---
he stood in a corner. 
---
at
 sight of her he advanced up the side opposite, and. 
---
that he had not as yet revealed

---
He lingered awhile in the vestibule, and
---
the service was some way
 advanced when he was put into a seat. 
---
It was a louring, mournful,
 still afternoon, when a religion of some sort seems a necessity to
 ordinary practical men, and not only a luxury of the emotional
 and leisured classes. 
---
he could discern the opposite worshippers
 indistinctly only
---
he saw. 
---
He had not
 long discovered the exact seat that she occupied when the chanting
 of the119th Psalm in which the choir was engaged reached its second
 part,
---
a young man cleanse his way?



---
It was the very question that was engaging Jude's attention at this
 moment. 
---
What a wicked worthless fellow he had been, and
---
as
 he had done to an animal passion for a woman
---
as he had been
---
that he could hardly believe
---
that
 the psalm was not specially set by some regardful Providence for this
 moment of his first entry into the solemn building
---
for whom he was beginning
---
ensphered by the same harmonies as those
 which floated into his ears
---
the thought was a delight to him.

---
, steeped body and
 soul in church sentiment, had,
 no doubt, much in common with him. 
---
To an impressionable and lonely
 young man the consciousness of having at last found anchorage for
 his thoughts, to supply both social and spiritual
 possibilities, was like the dew of Hermon, and
---
he remained throughout
 the service in a sustaining atmosphere of ecstasy.


---
Though he was loth
---
to suspect it, some people might have said to him
.


---
Jude waited. 
---
before he himself moved
---
he reached the door
---
Being dressed up in his Sunday suit he was. 
---
But he was not quite ready; and,?


---
he to do so with the kind of feeling that was awakening in him
---
he had persuaded himself
---
, he
 could not altogether be blind to the real nature of the magnetism.

---
he
 said,"! 
---
I, a man with a wife, must not know her!" 
---
It would put all thought of a tender wish on his part out
 of Sue's mind, and.

---
that he saw
---
how little he cared for the
 freedom and fearlessness that would result in her from such
 knowledge
---
The man rose, and,!" in an accent
 that agreed with his appearance. 
---
he dexterously lifted
 upon his knee the great board with its assembled notabilities divine
 and human, and
---
First he offered her his
 smaller wares-- the busts of kings and queens, then a minstrel, then
 a winged Cupid. 
---
He said.


---
I can not afford that
---
to her surprise the image- man drew them from their wire stay and
. 
---
the man had gone
---
It fell upon the ears of another person who sat bending over his
 books at a not very distant spot in the same city. 
---
the morrow was one on which Jude had not set his alarm- clock to
, and
---
hence he had stayed up,. 
---
than he could afford
---
Just then he was earnestly reading
 from his Griesbach's text. 
---
At the very time that staring at her figures, the policeman and belated citizens passing
 along under his window might have heard,
---
" Oh-- I bought them of a travelling man who sells casts--"

" Two saints?"

 Jude an indescribable enchantment: inexplicable sounds something
 like these:--

"_ All hemin heis Theos ho Pater,
---
"



 IV


 He was a handy man at his trade, an all- round man,. 
---
In London the man declines. 
---
Jude to run, or much window- tracery on the bankers, he would go out
, and.


---
that he saw
---
when he was on a ladder executing
 a job of this sort inside one of the churches
---
Jude came down from his
 ladder, and, and
---
he could resume his tapping. 
---
He
 did not observe.


---
Jude sat watching her pretty shoulders, her easy, curiously
 nonchalant risings and sittings, and her perfunctory genuflexions,
 and. 
---
what a help such an Anglican would have been to him in
 happier circumstances
---
It was not so much his anxiety
---
him go up to it
---
to get on with
 his work to take their leave: it was,
. 
---
that he dared not, in this holy spot
---
why he must
 not attempt intimate acquaintance with Sue Bridehead,,

---
now that his
 interest in her had shown itself
---
that man could
 not live by work alone
---
that the particular man Jude, at any rate,
 wanted something to love. 
---
Some men would have rushed incontinently
 to her,. 
---
But as the days, and still more particularly the lonely evenings,
 dragged along, he found himself, to his moral consternation,
. 
---
Surrounded by her influence all day, walking past the
 spots, he was always thinking of her, and.


---
that his conscience was likely to be the loser in
 this battle
---
though he desired
---
that, to know her, he
 did not desire
---
when the man was bent on such a course as Jude purposed
---
This
 conviction was so real with him that one day when, as was frequent,
 he was at work in a neighbouring village church alone, he felt it to
 be his duty to pray against his weakness. 
---
as he wished to

---
But much be an exemplar in these things he could not get on. 
---
, he found,
---
So
 he excused himself. 
---
," he said,
---
I can see; and
---
Thus he went on adoring her,. 
---
that those items were not
 at all the cause of his affection for her
---
," said one of the men known as Uncle Joe.


---
what he's doing now
---
if
 Mr. Jude Fawley was at work in the yard
---
that Jude
 had gone out somewhere or other that afternoon, which information she
 received with a look of disappointment, and
---
When Jude returned
---
I do n't know I do n't know-- not much they told him, and!"


---
whereupon he
 exclaimed,"
---
He looked along the street after her, but
---
He
 had no longer any thought of a conscientious avoidance of her, and

---
when he reached
 his lodging
---
And he found a note from her--
---
which is shown in such
 innocent first epistles from women to men
---
That was a contingency he had never thought of, and
---
it spurred him
. 
---
He would meet her that very
 evening
---
, he said, one hour from the time of writing, at the cross in
 the pavement which marked the spot of the Martyrdoms.


---
When he had despatched the note by a boy he regretted that in his
 hurry he should have suggested to her to meet him out of doors, when
 he might have said he would call upon her. 
---
It was, in fact, the
 country custom to meet thus, and nothing else had occurred to him.

---
he moved towards the point a few minutes before
 the hour, under the glimmer of the newly lighted lamps.


---
He saw a figure on the other side, which turned out to
, and
---
" I am not going! 
---
waiting her pleasure, Jude watched
 when he did likewise, the place
 being where the carriers' carts stood in the daytime,.


---
" I am sorry that I asked you to meet me, and did n't call
---
," began Jude
 with the bashfulness of a lover. 
---
" But I thought."


---
" Oh-- I do n't mind that
---
though Jude did not look much at her
---
if you know anything of him
---
he is
---
He lives a little way out in
 the country, at Lumsdon. 
---
He's a village schoolmaster.
---
if he's the same
---
Do you know his Christian name
---
-- is it Richard?
---
" Then he could n't do it!"


---
Jude's countenance fell, for how could he succeed in an enterprise
 wherein the great Phillotson had failed? 
---
He would have had a day of
 despair.


---
if the news had not arrived during his sweet Sue's presence,
 but
---
even at this moment he had visions of how Phillotson's failure in
 the grand university scheme
---
said Jude suddenly. 
---
if Mr. Phillotson was likely to
 be at home, and
---
that he was always at home
---
A knock
 brought him to the school- house door, with a candle in his hand and a
 look of inquiry on his face, which had grown thin and careworn since
 Jude last set eyes on him.


---
That after all these years the meeting with Mr. Phillotson should be
 of this homely complexion destroyed at one stroke the halo which had
 surrounded the school- master's figure in Jude's imagination ever
 since their parting. 
---
It created in him at the same time a sympathy
 with Phillotson as an obviously much chastened and disappointed man.

---
Jude told him his name, and.


---
he had come
---
who had been kind to him in his youthful days
---
" I do n't remember you in the least
---
," said Jude,.


---
he had not come
---
I was there a short time. 
---
I wrote to you for some grammars, if you
 recollect, and
---
" I remember; but
---
I thought all that privately
---
I wonder. 
---
I did not keep
 my own counsel
---
" I have never forgotten it. 
---
" Come in," said Phillotson. 
---
Phillotson took it off,
---
The old friendship was imperceptibly renewed, the schoolmaster
 speaking of his experiences, and the cousins of theirs. 
---
He told them
. 
---
that he still thought of the Church sometimes, and
---
though he
 could not enter it
---
as he had intended
---
that to do in former years he might
 enter it as a licentiate
---
, he said,
---
Meanwhile he was comfortable in
 his present position,.


---
though he was in want of a pupil- teacher
---
talked of nothing more than general subjects, Jude was surprised to
. 
---
what a revelation of woman his cousin was to him
---
It was with
 heart- sickness he perceived that, while her sentiments towards him
 were those of the frankest friendliness.


---
only, he loved her more than
 before becoming acquainted with her; and but in the thought of her departure
---
he said regretfully. 
---
" How can
 you do otherwise than cling to a city in whose history such men as
 Newman, Pusey, Ward, Keble, loom so large!"


---
I should never
 have thought of it!" 
---
" Well-- I must go
---
whom I serve
---
I with her; and it
 is best to go."


---
Too Catholic- Apostolic for her, I suppose? 
---
Then I am surprised!"


---
So I was led; and
---
that I resolved, but
---
which I shall be more independent
---
, I heard.
---
" I never thought of resuming it;
---
for I was getting on as an
 art- designer."


---
me ask Mr. Phillotson
---
you try your hand in his
 school
---
Now I must go in. 
---
I am so
 glad we have met at last. 
---
Jude did not like.


---
quite how much he agreed with her
---
in which he had his lodging
---
To keep Sue Bridehead near him was now a desire which operated
 without regard of consequences, and the next evening he again set out
 for Lumsdon, fearing to trust to the persuasive effects of a note
 only. 
---
What I rather wanted
---
","
 he said. 
---
Jude said
---
, he thought, and
---
which Jude knew nothing whatever, so influenced the schoolmaster
---
that
 he said
---
he would engage her,
---
unless
 his cousin really meant, and
---
his ingenious
 arguments on her natural fitness for assisting Mr. Phillotson, of
 assuring Jude as a friend that to follow on in the same course regarded
 this step as the first stage of an apprenticeship, of which her
 training in a normal school would be the second stage, her time would
 be wasted quite,
---
The day after this visit Phillotson received a letter from Jude,

---
that he had again consulted his cousin
---
It did not occur for a moment to the
 schoolmaster and recluse that Jude's ardour in promoting the
 arrangement arose from any other feelings towards Sue than the
 instinct of co- operation common among members of the same family.




---
V


 The schoolmaster sat in his homely dwelling attached to the school,
; and
---
he looked across the way at the old
 house in which his teacher Sue had a lodging. 
---
A pupil- teacher to have been
 transferred to Mr. Phillotson's school had failed him, and
---
Phillotson thought
. 
---
He had found her quite as bright as Jude had described her;
 and
---
who
 saves him half his labour
---
he
 was waiting. 
---
when he would
 follow
---
he watched her as a curiosity. 
---
He went to the school also, and
---
It was part of his duty
---
Richard Phillotson thought of
 the absurdity of the regulation in this case, when he was old enough
 to be the girl's father; but
---
he faithfully acted up to it; and. 
---
, he must perceive
 all that was passing in her brain, as right or wrong. 
---
Phillotson was

---
which somehow seemed strange to him as preceptor
---
that he was thinking of her thus
---
For a few weeks their work had gone on with a monotony which in
 itself was a delight to him. 
---
They marched along
 the road two and two, she beside her class with her simple cotton
 sunshade, her little thumb cocked up against its stem; and Phillotson
 behind in his long dangling coat, handling his walking- stick
 genteelly, in the musing mood which had come over him since her
 arrival. 
---
the proprietor, with a fine religious philanthropy written on his
 features, walked with a pointer in his hand,; Mount Moriah, the Valley of Jehoshaphat,
 the City of Zion, the walls and the gates, outside one of which there
 was a large mound like a tumulus, and on the mound a little white
 cross. 
---
, he said,
---
I think
---
his form being bent so low in his intent
 inspection of the Valley of Jehoshaphat
---
that his face was
---
" He does n't think!"


---
Jude started up from his reverie, and. 
---
he said,
 with a glad flush of embarrassment. 
---
I saw and

---
but I got so deeply interested that I did n't
 remember where I was. 
---
I could
 examine it for hours, but
---
I have only a few minutes, unfortunately;

---
for I am in the middle of a job out here."


---
," said Phillotson, with good- humoured satire. 
---
" No, Mr. Phillotson, I am not-- altogether! 
---
I hate
---
," said Jude ardently().

---
although he did not
---
" And I think."


---
" That's a good Jude--
---
I know!" 
---
Jude returning to his work
---
He watched the
 juvenile flock in their clean frocks and pinafores,. 
---
Phillotson had invited him and, and
---
Jude had eagerly promised.


---
" I thought?
---
hardly looked at
 it" he said.


---
I hardly did
---
To Mr. Phillotson the surprise was not great
---
; like the lady in the
 story, he had been played that trick too many times.

---
Phillotson, with a strange instinct of solicitude
 quite beyond his control, was at her side just in time to prevent her
. 
---
him holding her hand
---
Now
 he'll write and, and
---
" He wo n't do that, my dear little girl. 
---
He looked so gently at her. 
---
Jude in the meantime had been waiting impatiently for Friday. 
---
On
 both Wednesday and Thursday he had been so much under the influence
 of his desire to see her that he walked after dark some distance
 along the road in the direction of the village, and, on returning to
 his room to read
---
as he had got himself up
---
as he
 thought, and
---
On Friday, as soon to see him made a hasty tea, he set
 out, notwithstanding that the evening was wet. 
---
they dripped sadly upon him,
;
---
for though he
 knew
---
that he loved her
---
he also knew.


---
that he could not be more to her
 than he was
---
that
 greeted his eyes
---
He was too far back, but
---
for them to notice
 him
---
he knew in a moment that they were Sue and Phillotson. 
---
And lane Jude saw his arm round the girl's waist;

---
Phillotson place
---
he replaced it; and
---
There he remained
,
.


---
Phillotson going on to the school hard by
---
" Oh, he's too old for her-- too old!"
---
He could not interfere. 
---
Was he not Arabella's? 
---
He was unable to
 go on further, and. 
---
Every
 tread of his feet seemed. 
---
that he must on no account

---
Phillotson was perhaps
 twenty years her senior, but
---
The ironical clinch to his sorrow was
 given by the thought that the intimacy between his cousin and the
 schoolmaster had been brought about entirely by himself.




---
on the
 following Sunday he went a visit which was the result of
 a victorious struggle against his inclination to turn aside to the
 village of Lumsdon and obtain a miserable interview with his cousin,
 in which the word nearest his heart could not be spoken, and the
 sight which had tortured him could not be revealed.


---
a great part of Jude's
 short day was occupied in making arrangements for her comfort. 
---
for him to leave, and
---
that he obtained a quiet talk with her
---
his
 words tended insensibly towards his cousin.


---
" Your marrying that woman Arabella was about as bad a thing as a man
. 
---
A relief was afforded to him by the entry of the companion and nurse
 of his aunt, who must have been listening to the conversation, for
. 
---
he left the cottage of his aunt
 that day with a heavy heart. 
---
He would fain; but
---
he checked his desire and.


---
who had known him during his
 residence here
---
Jude
 was startled by a salute from one of them:


---
Jude showed.


---
that he did not understand
---
" Ah, no!" said Jude. 
---
" I am almost as far off that as ever."


---
Jude slapped his pocket.


---
"," said Jude, with some bitterness. 
---
Still, the remark was sufficient to withdraw Jude's attention from
 the imaginative world he had lately inhabited, in which an abstract
 figure, more or less himself, was steeping his mind in a sublimation
 of the arts and sciences, and making his calling and election sure
 to a seat in the paradise of the learned. 
---
He was set. 
---
He had lately felt. 
---
that he
 could not quite satisfy himself in his Greek-- in the Greek of
 the dramatists particularly
---
was he
---
that he could not maintain the critical attention
 necessary for thorough application
---
He felt.


---
that he wanted a
 coach-- a friend at his elbow to tell him in a moment what sometimes
 would occupy him a weary month in extracting from unanticipative,
 clumsy books
---
than he had done of late
---
" I ought. 
---
," he said,
---
as he journeyed
 back
---
where I am going
---
what I am aiming at... 
---
I must get special information."


---
The next week accordingly he sought it. 
---
when he saw an elderly gentleman,
 who had been pointed out as the head of a particular college, walking
 in the public path of a parklike enclosure near the spot at which
 Jude chanced to be sitting
---
Jude
 looked anxiously at his face. 
---
On second thoughts Jude felt; but
---
that he could not
 go up and
---
he was sufficiently influenced by the
 incident.


---
for him to state his
 difficulties by letter to some of the best and most judicious of
 these old masters
---
During the next week or two he accordingly placed himself in such
 positions about the city; and
---
he ultimately selected five
---
that they were appreciative and
 far- seeing men
---
To these five he addressed letters,.


---
Jude mentally began
---
to criticize
 them; he wished. 
---
," he thought. 
---
" Why could n't I know better than address utter
 strangers in such a way? 
---
I may be an impostor, an idle scamp, a man
 with a bad character, for all that they know to the contrary...

---
what I am
---
Nevertheless, he found. 
---
himself clinging to the hope of some reply
 as to his one last chance of redemption
---
He waited day after day,
.

---
While he waited.

---
he was suddenly stirred by news about Phillotson
---
Phillotson was giving up the school near Christminster, for a larger
 one further south, in Mid- Wessex. 
---
how it would
 affect his cousin
---
;;, in view of a
 provision for two instead of one, he would not allow.

---
himself to say
---
whom Jude was passionately enamoured
---
And the tender relations between Phillotson and the young girl of
 effectually made it repugnant to

---
to whom Jude had written

---
the young man was thus thrown back
 entirely on himself, as formerly, with the added gloom of a weakened
 hope. 
---
By indirect inquiries he soon perceived clearly. 
---
what he had

---
that a man reading on his own
 system, however widely and thoroughly, even over the prolonged period
 of ten years, should be able to compete with those who had passed
 their lives under trained teachers and had worked to ordained lines
---
The other course, that of buying himself in, so to speak, seemed the
 only one really open to men like him, the difficulty being simply of
 a material kind. 
---
With the help of his information he began. 
---
at which, with the best of fortune, he would be
 able to save money
---
before he could be in a
 position to forward testimonials to the head of a college and advance
 to a matriculation examination
---
He saw. 
---
what a curious and cunning glamour the neighbourhood of the
 place had exercised over him
---
as the spot shaped its
 charms to him from its halo on the horizon, the obvious and ideal
 thing to do
---
" Let," he had said with the
 fatuousness of Crusoe over his big boat," and." 
---
It would have been far better for him in
 every way
---
if he had never come within sight and sound of the delusive
 precincts
---
Well, all that was clear to him,. 
---
He looked back at himself along the
 vista of his past years, and
---
his thought was akin to Heine's:


   !



---
I see the motley mocking fool's- cap rise
---
Fortunately he had not been allowed. 
---
And the
 painful details of his awakening to a sense of his limitations should
 now be spared her as far as possible. 
---
He always remembered the appearance of the afternoon on which he
 awoke from his dream. 
---
Not quite knowing what to do with himself, he
 went up to an octagonal chamber in the lantern of a singularly built
 theatre that was set amidst this quaint and singular city. 
---
Jude's eyes swept all the views in
 succession, meditatively, mournfully, yet sturdily. 
---
Those buildings
 and their associations and privileges were not for him. 
---
into which he hardly ever had time
 to enter
---
From the
 looming roof of the great library,, his gaze travelled on to the varied spires, halls, gables,
 streets, chapels, gardens, quadrangles, which composed the ensemble
 of this unrivalled panorama. 
---
He saw but
---
that his destiny lay not with
 these,
---
which he
 himself occupied, unrecognized as part of the city at all by its
 visitors and panegyrists,
---
He looked over the town into the country beyond, to the trees which
 screened her whose presence had at first been the support of his
 heart, and whose loss was now a maddening torture. 
---
But for this blow
 he might have borne with his fate. 
---
With Sue as companion he could
 have renounced his ambitions with a smile. 
---
Without her it was
 inevitable that the reaction from the long strain to which he had
 subjected himself should affect him disastrously. 
---
Phillotson had

---
which now enveloped him
---
while for him there was no
 consoler
---
Descending to the streets, he went listlessly along. 
---
till he arrived
 at an inn, and
---
Here he drank several glasses of beer in
 rapid succession, and
---
when he came out
---
he rambled home to supper, and
---
when his landlady brought up a letter that had just
 arrived for him
---
Jude perceived. 
---
that it
 bore the embossed stamp of one of the colleges whose heads he had

---
not exactly what he had expected;
. 
---
SIR,-- I have read your letter with interest; and,.
   
---
what I advise you
---
This terribly sensible advice exasperated Jude. 
---
He had known all
 that before. 
---
He knew. 
---
its effect upon him just now was, and,
---
him
 rise recklessly from the table
---
He stood at a bar and
---
till he
 came to a spot called The Fourways in the middle of the city,
---
, he began.


---
stretched out his elbows elevated himself
 an inch and a half on the balls of his toes, smiled, and looking
 humorously at Jude said,"."


---
You've had a wet, young man
---
" No; I've only begun," he replied cynically.


---
Whatever his wetness, his brains were dry enough. 
---
He only heard in
 part the policeman's further remarks, having fallen into thought on
. 
---
people like himself had stood at that crossway, whom
 nobody ever thought of now
---
He began.

---
These struggling men and women before him were the reality of
 Christminster,.

---
He looked at his watch, and,
---
in pursuit of this idea, he went on.

---
till
 he came to a public hall, where a promenade concert was in progress
---
Jude entered, and. 
---
He had tapped the
 real Christminster life. 
---
every now and then a man got upon
 a platform and.


---
The spirit of Sue seemed to hover round him and prevent his flirting
 and drinking with the frolicsome girls who made advances-- wistful
 to gain a little joy. 
---
At ten o'clock he came away,.


---
by an impulse, he took from his pocket the
 lump of chalk which as a workman he usually carried there, and
---
I have understanding as well as you
---
wrote
 along the wall:

"_; I am not inferior to you:

---
The stroke of scorn relieved his mind, and
---
the next morning he
 laughed at his self- conceit.
---
which had at first exasperated him
---
He saw himself as a fool indeed.


---
Deprived of the objects of both intellect and emotion, he could not
 proceed to his work. 
---
Whenever he felt
---
reconciled to his fate as a
 student, there came. 
---
he had ever met
---
That the one affined soul was lost to him
 through his marriage returned upon him with cruel persistency, till,
 unable to bear it longer
---
, he again rushed for distraction to the
 real Christminster life. 
---
He now sought it out in an obscure and
 low- ceiled tavern up a court which was well known to certain worthies
 of the place, and
---
Here he sat more or less all the day,.


---
that he was at bottom a vicious character, of whom it was hopeless to

---
Jude still retaining his seat in the corner,
---
though his money was all

---
he had not eaten anything the whole day except a biscuit.

---
He surveyed his gathering companions with all the equanimity
 and philosophy of a man who has been drinking long and slowly,
 and but. 
---
Jude Fawley, with the self- conceit, effrontery, and_ aplomb_ of
 a strong- brained fellow in liquor, threw in his remarks somewhat
 peremptorily; and
---
his aims having been, everything the others said turned upon his tongue, by a sort
 of mechanical craze, to the subject of scholarship and study, the
 extent of his own learning being dwelt upon with an insistence that
 would have appeared pitiable to himself in his sane hours.


---
I do n't care a damn
---
"," he was saying," for any provost, warden,
 principal, fellow, or cursed master of arts in the university! 
---
What
 I know
---
that I'd lick'em on their own ground, and
---
I do n't doubt.  I always
 saw; and I took my
 steps accordingly, or I should n't have been the man I am."

" You aim at the Church
---
" I should think so!" said Jude haughtily.


---
He drank off the spirits in his tumbler,.
---
"

" I wo n't!" said Jude.


---
" Yes, he can!
---
said Jude. 
---
I'll do it straight off."


---
the
 glass was handed across to Jude, who, having drunk the contents,
 stood up and began rhetorically, without hesitation:

"_ Credo in unum Deum, Patrem omnipotentem, Factorem coeli et terrae,
 visibilium omnium et invisibilium.
---
Jude's voice echoing sonorously into the inner parlour, where
 the landlord was dozing, and bringing him out to see what was going
 on
---
Jude had declaimed steadily ahead, and
---
But Jude's mind seemed, and
---
he could not get
 on. 
---
He put his hand to his forehead, and
---
his face assumed an
 expression of pain.


---
" Give him another glass-- then he'll fetch up and
---
Jude stretched
 out his arm for it without looking, and
---
as he neared the
 end with the manner of a priest leading a congregation:

"_ Et in Spiritum Sanctum, Dominum et vivificantem,
---
Then Jude seemed.


---
as he stared
 round upon them
---
he cried. 
---
his license endorsed for harbouring
 queer characters
---
Jude, in his sudden flash of reason, had turned in disgust and.


---
He hastened down the lane and round into the straight broad street,
 which he followed till it merged in the highway, and all sound of his
 late companions had been left behind. 
---
Onward he still went, under
 the influence of a childlike yearning for the one being in the world
 to whom it seemed possible to fly-- an unreasoning desire, whose ill
 judgement was not apparent to him now. 
---
In the course of an hour,
, he entered the village of
 Lumsdon, and.


---
that a light was burning in
 a downstairs room, which he assumed, rightly as it happened, to be
 hers
---
whether I
 have said it or no what
 I have brought myself to-- the crew I have come among Jude stepped close to the wall, and"


---
" Is it Jude? 
---
" Oh, I am-- I could n't help coming, Sue!" said he,. 
---
" I am so wicked,
---
I could not bear my life! 
---
So I have been drinking,
 and blaspheming, or next door to it, and! 
---
Sue-- kill me-- I do n't care! 
---
No, I wo n't despise you
---
; of course I wo n't!

---
what I can do for you
---
Jude, now getting towards his
 sober senses, could only say," Dear, dear Sue!" in a voice broken by
 grief and contrition.


---
if he wanted anything to eat
---
he shook his head.

---
Almost immediately he fell into a heavy slumber, and. 
---
At first he did not know, but
---
where he was
---
by degrees his
 situation cleared to him, and
---
he beheld it in all the ghastliness
 of a right mind. 
---
How
 could he face her now? 
---
there would he be in all his shame
. 
---
He could not bear the thought, and
---
, he slipped noiselessly out of the house.


---
His fixed idea was, and

---
which occurred to him
---
He called at his lodging in Christminster, where he found awaiting
 him a note of dismissal from his employer; and
---
that had been such a thorn in his
 side
---
He had no money left in
 his pocket, his small savings, deposited at one of the banks in
 Christminster,. 
---
To get to
 Marygreen, therefore, his only course was walking; and the distance
 being nearly twenty miles
---
, he had ample time to complete on the way
 the sobering process begun in him.


---
he reached Alfredston
---
Here he pawned
 his waistcoat, and
---
At dawn he rose,, whereon he had carved
 his hopes years ago.


---
which had been visible to him a long
 way off, and
---
He reached the ancient hamlet.

---
Weary and mud- bespattered, but quite possessed of his ordinary
 clearness of brain, he sat down by the well,. 
---
as he did so

---
what a poor Christ he made
---
Seeing a trough of water near he bathed
 his face, and.


---
whom he found
 breakfasting in bed
---
" Yes," said Jude heavily. 
---
" I think."


---
I must have a little rest
---
, he went up to his old room and. 
---
He fell
 asleep for a short while, and
---
when he awoke. 
---
as if he had
 awakened in hell
---
He thought of that previous abyss into

---
which he had fallen before leaving this part of the country
---
; the
 deepest deep he had supposed it then; but
---
That had been the breaking in of the outer bulwarks of his hope:

---
this was of his second line.


---
If he had been a woman he must have screamed under the nervous
 tension which he was now undergoing. 
---
But that relief being denied to
 his virility
---
, he clenched his teeth in misery,.


---
He guessed its origin in a moment or two
---
; the curate was praying with
 his aunt in the adjoining room. 
---
He remembered her speaking of him.

---
Jude sat up, and
---
The step made for his door,, and a man looked in.

---
" I think
---
," said Jude. 
---
here I am
---
though I had the best intentions in the world at one
 time
---
Now I am melancholy mad, what with drinking and one thing and
 another."


---
Slowly Jude unfolded to the curate his late plans and movements, by
 an unconscious bias dwelling less upon the intellectual and ambitious
 side of his dream, and more upon the theological,.


---
I know
---
" Now I have been a fool, and
---
" And I do n't regret the collapse of my
 university
---
I would n't begin again. 
---
if I were sure to
 succeed
---
I do n't care for social success any more at all. 
---
But I do
 feel; and
---
I should like
---
I bitterly regret the
 Church, and the loss of my chance of being her ordained minister."


---
who was a new man to this neighbourhood
---
at last he said:". 
---
I wo n't say from your conversation
---
that of a thoughtful and educated man, you might enter the
 Church as a licentiate
---
" I could avoid that easily enough,!"






---
if I had any kind of hope to
 support me
---
A man could preach and

---
He feared.

---
that
 his whole scheme had degenerated to,
---
There were thousands of young men on the same self- seeking track
 at the present moment. 
---
that he could not

---
But to enter the Church in such an unscholarly way in any probability rise to a higher grade through all his career than
 that of the humble curate wearing his life out in an obscure village
 or city slum--; that might be true religion, and a purgatorial course worthy of
 being followed by a remorseful man.


---
in which this new thought showed itself by
 contrast with his foregone intentions
---
The favourable light cheered Jude,; and
---
as he sat there,
 shabby and lonely
---
He did
 nothing, however, for some long stagnant time to advance his new
 desire,.


---
; Melchester
 was a quiet and soothing place, almost entirely ecclesiastical in its
 tone; a spot where worldly learning and intellectual smartness had no
 establishment; where the altruistic feeling that he did possess would
 perhaps be more highly estimated than a brilliancy which he did not.


---
that he should continue for a time to work
 at his trade while reading up Divinity, which he had neglected at
 Christminster for the ordinary classical grind,
---
That his excessive human interest in the new place
 was entirely of Sue's making,
---
to which he was not blind
---
But that much
 he conceded to human frailty, and.


---
He considered.

---
that he might so mark out his coming years as to begin
 his ministry at the age of thirty-- an age which much attracted him as
 being that of his exemplar when he first began to teach in Galilee
---
This would allow him plenty of time for deliberate study, and for
 acquiring capital by his trade to help his aftercourse of keeping the
 necessary terms at a theological college.




---
The time was just the worst in the year for Jude, and
---
he had written. 
---
that
 he should postpone his arrival for a month or so,
---
that he wished
---
he had not
 proposed it
---
; could he come
 immediately?--
---
when he did come
---
It was Mr. Phillotson, and
---
Phillotson's suit was; and
---
Jude
 felt unreasonably glad. 
---
He packed up his things and.


---
than he had known for months
---
he duly looked about for
 a temperance hotel, and. 
---
When he had

---
he walked out into the dull winter light over
 the town bridge, and
---
standing under the walls of the most graceful
 architectural pile in England he paused and. 
---
he walked round. 
---
He took it as a good omen that numerous blocks
 of stone were lying about, which signified that the cathedral was
 undergoing restoration or repair to a considerable extent. 
---
It seemed
 to him, full of the superstitions of his beliefs,.


---
that he might
 find plenty to do in the art he practised while waiting for a call to
 higher labours
---
Then a wave of warmth came over him; the girl with the kindling glance,
 daringly soft at times-- something like that of the girls he had
 seen in engravings from paintings of the Spanish school. 
---
as he thought how near he
---
He went down the broad gravel path towards the building. 
---
Jude opened the
 gate and and
---
through which, on inquiring for his
 cousin, he was gingerly admitted to a waiting- room
---
as he had
 seen her last
---
That had plainly
 been dashed off in an impulse which second thoughts had somewhat
 regretted; thoughts that were possibly of his recent self- disgrace.

---
Jude was quite overcome with emotion.


---
Jude felt. 
---
him to kiss her,, under other
 colours than those of cousinship
---
as he was burning
---
He could not perceive the least
 sign that Sue regarded him as a lover, or ever would do so, now that
 she knew the worst of him, even if he had the right to behave as one;
 and this helped on his growing resolve to tell her of his matrimonial
 entanglement, which he had put off doing from time to time in sheer
 dread of losing the bliss of her company.


---
Jude said he would like
 to buy her a little present of some sort, and
---
Jude thereupon took her to an inn and. 
---
To all this he listened
---
;
 but it was not-- her relations with
 Phillotson. 
---
what he wanted especially
---
eaten, Jude impulsively placed his hand upon hers
---
", Jude, are n't they?
---
a man's
 hands subdued to what he works in
---
Mr. Phillotson will use his influence."


---
said Jude,"."


---
that he-- cared about you rather warmly, and
---
" He has said something about it,
---
I expect.
---
If he had
---
" Oh, come, Sue; he's not so very old. 
---
And I know
---
what I saw him
 doing--"


---
that I'm certain
---
" Ah-- I remember. 
---
But I did n't know.
---
he was going to
---
" I know, and
---
if I tell you everything
---
why I
 do n't want to
---
" Very well, then, dear," he said soothingly. 
---
" I have no real right
 to ask you, and
---
I do n't wish."


---
" I shall tell you!"
---
his
 plan being-- he the boys' and I the girls'--as married school- teachers often

---
He glanced at her and
---
their eyes met, the reproach in his own belying
 his words. 
---
Then he drew his hand quite away from hers, and. 
---
This was just the one thing he would not be able to bear,
---
" Oh yes,"
 he said quickly. 
---
I have a perfect right to see you; and
---
when I want to
---
I
 shall!"


---
he let the subject drift
 away. 
---
he asked,.


---
Though I think
---
I'd rather sit in the railway
 station
---
Jude looked distressed.


---
He took her to the gate and
---
Jude had a conviction that
 his unhappy visit to her on that sad night had precipitated this
 marriage engagement, and
---
However, next day he set about seeking employment, which it was not
 so easy to get as at Christminster,. 
---
But he edged himself in by degrees. 
---
His first work was
 some carving at the cemetery on the hill; and
---
ultimately he became
. 
---
he most desired
---
he had confidence enough in his own
 skill with the mallet and chisel to feel that it would be a matter of
 choice with himself how long he would stay.


---
he took near the Close Gate
---
The lodgings would not have disgraced a
 curate, the rent representing a higher percentage on his wages than

---
His combined bed and
 sitting- room was furnished with framed photographs of the rectories
 and deaneries at which his landlady had lived as trusted servant in
 her time, and
---
Jude added to the furniture of his room by unpacking
 photographs of the ecclesiastical carvings and monuments that he
 had executed with his own hands; and
---
he was deemed a satisfactory
 acquisition as tenant of the vacant apartment.


---
He found an ample supply of theological books in the city book- shops,
 and
---
As a relaxation from the Fathers,
 and such stock works as Paley and Butler, he read Newman, Pusey, and
 many other modern lights. 
---
He hired a harmonium,.




---
Every detail of the outing was
 a facet reflecting a sparkle to Jude, and
---
he did not venture to
 meditate on the life of inconsistency he was leading. 
---
His Sue's
 conduct was one lovely conundrum to him
---
; he could say no more.


---
which comforted Jude in the thought
---
that
 only himself knew the charms those habiliments subdued
---
Jude did not respond. 
---
He thought the remark unnecessarily cruel,
 and partly untrue.


---
as one might be interested in a man
 puzzling out his way along a labyrinth from which one had one's self
 escaped
---
Jude began.

---
He told them.


---
that the only house near
 was his mother's and his,
---
" A nice little cottage," said Jude.


---
" Oh, I do n't know about the niceness. 
---
I shall have, and
---
," he
 said with a deprecating wave of the hand;
---
I do n't mind, but
---
He turned to Jude and?"


---
" Hsh-- no!" said Jude.


---
," said Jude, a recollection of her engagement reviving
 his soreness a little.


---
" Indeed I am not, Jude. 
---
I like, but
---
I crave to
."


---
" Oh, have n't I! 
---
as he had said
---
" I
 expect!"
---
I shall catch it
---
" Oh, I bought something for you, which I had nearly forgotten
---
He took it gladly, and
---
when he opened the gate
---
," said a second- year's student, who
 knew about young men. 
---
" And Miss Traceley saw her at the station with
 him. 
---
he was her cousin
---
who had seen Jude from the window
---
being
 kissed by such a kindly- faced young man
---
" He is a friend, or. 
---
He was a young man with a black beard."


---
" This young man was discharged from his work at Christminster for
 drunkenness and blasphemy in public- houses, and
---
he has come here to
 live,."


---
on reflection he said, but
---
that he remembered
---
he had taken no notice,
.


---
On the self- same evening Jude sat in his lodgings by the Close Gate.

---
Often at this hour after dusk he would enter the silent Close, and
. 
---
he had
 nothing else to do
---
But to- night, having finished
 tea and brushed himself up, he was deep in the perusal of the
 Twenty- ninth Volume of Pusey's Library of the Fathers, a set of books
 which he had purchased of a second- hand dealer at a price that seemed
 to him to be one of miraculous cheapness for that invaluable work.
---
He
 fancied
---
he heard
---
something rattle lightly against his window
---
; then he
 heard it again. 
---
He rose and
.


---
Jude waited,
---
He palpitated at the thought that she
 had fled to him in her trouble as he had fled to her in his.
---
He unlatched the door of his room,
---
He went up, and.


---
Can I come up without being seen?" I'm so cold!"" he asked, with alarm, the
 tender epithet slipping out unawares.


---
what I've
 done
---
so I got out of the window and

---
" Dear Sue!" he said. 
---
I'll ask her."


---
In fact, everything
 was close and handy in Jude's single chamber,. 
---
He opened a drawer,
---
Now, how long
 shall I give you
---
Jude left the room and. 
---
where he walked up and
 down
---
he returned. 
---
he saw defencelessness that his
 heart felt big with the sense of it. 
---
as he sat down beside her
---
" I suppose,
---
I wish! 
---
I did n't feel so ill and
 sick
---
I'll get. 
---
Dear, dear
 Sue, what can I get for you?"


---
" I do n't know! 
---
I ca n't help. 
---
I wish."

---
I could get warm
---
Jude put on her his great- coat in addition, and
---
, whence he returned with a little bottle in his
 hand. 
---
," he said. 
---
" I ca n't out of the bottle, can I?" 
---
Jude fetched the glass from the
 dressing- table, and. 
---
He
 softly went nearer to her, and. 
---
Then he stood with his back to the fire,
 and.




---
IV


 Jude's reverie was interrupted by the creak of footsteps ascending
 the stairs.


---
He whisked Sue's clothing from the chair where it was drying,. 
---
" Oh, I did n't know. 
---
I
 wanted. 
---
I see.
---
But I think.
---
I wo n't come down to- night
---
I'll have a cup of tea as well."


---
It was Jude's custom to go downstairs to the kitchen, and. 
---
His landlady brought up the
 supper, however, on this occasion, and
---
he took it from her at the
 door.


---
he set the teapot on the hob, and; but
---
, he found,
---
So he hung them up again, and

---
though Jude, any, began
---
till her conversation fixed his attention
---
," he said with a sigh. 
---
Come on' he is always afraid to, and
---
look
 it, he never comes. 
---
he taught me a great deal, and
---
He died, poor fellow, two or three years after he had taken
 his degree and left Christminster."


---
" You saw a good deal of him
---
He asked me, and
---
I agreed to by letter. 
---
when I joined him in London

---
But I found. 
---
he meant a different thing from what I meant
---
He wanted, but
---
me
 to be his mistress, in fact
---
I was n't in love with him-- and on

---
I should go away
---
if he did n't agree to MY plan
---
, he did

---
he became a
 leader- writer for one of the great London dailies;. 
---
till he was taken
 ill, and
---
He said
---
I was breaking his heart by
 holding out against him so long at such close quarters
---
; he could
 never have believed it of woman. 
---
I might play that game once too
 often
---
, he said. 
---
He came home merely. 
---
His death caused a
 terrible remorse in me for my cruelty--. 
---
though I hope
---
he died of
 consumption and not of me entirely
---
I went down to Sandbourne
 to his funeral, and. 
---
He left me a little
 money--
---
because I broke his heart
---
, I suppose. 
---
how men
 are-- so much better than women
---
Jude looked round upon the arm- chair and its occupant,. 
---
he had given shelter to
---
His voice
 trembled:"!"


---
as he said
---
, Sue, I believe
---
" I am not particularly innocent,, now. "
---
that I have


                           
---
though he could hear
---
I said how bad I was!"

"

" Have you told Mr. Phillotson about this university scholar friend?"

" Yes-- long ago. 
---
" What did he say?
---
" He did not pass any criticism--
---
Jude felt much depressed
---
He felt. 
---
though he could not quite say in what way
---
"," he said,. 
---
" I am absorbed in theology,
---
I should be doing just about now,
---
I should be saying my evening prayers. 
---
I suppose
---
I thought."

 I fondly thought at first as I do
 about that.
 And Mr. Phillotson--"

" I have no respect for Christminster whatever, except, in a qualified
 degree, on its intellectual side," said Sue Bridehead earnestly. 
---
He was the most irreligious
 man I ever knew, and the most moral. 
---
He spoke gently, and

---
" I still think; though I
 was resentful because I could n't get there." " It is an ignorant place, except as to the townspeople, artizans,
 drunkards, and paupers," she said, perverse still at his differing
 from her. 
---
You are one
 of the very men a man with a passion for learning, but no money, or
 opportunities, or friends. 
---
" What would Mr. Phillotson--"

" It is a place full of fetishists and ghost- seers!"


---
He noticed. 
---
he tried
---
Jude was extremely, morbidly, curious about her life as
 Phillotson's_ prot
---
just what I am," he said. 
---
" I am fearful of life,
 spectre- seeing always."


---
His heart bumped, and
---
he made no reply.


---
when was I there
---
what I want you to
---
At this time I read a chapter,
 and. 
---
as I told you
---
" I'll look at you."


---
I wo n't vex you, Jude,"

---
he was using
---
when he had finished and
---
Mr.-- but never mind his name,
 poor boy-- said. 
---
I know." H'm!" said Jude, with a sense of sacrilege.


---
Jude looked. 
---
he murmured.


---
Her speech
 had grown spirited, and almost petulant at his rebuke, and her eyes
 moist. 
---
he said,
.


---
that he
 might not see her brimming eyes
---
What I
 insist on
---
I am-- only too inclined just now to apply the words
 profanely. 
---
Jude saw the absurdity of
 quarrelling on such a hypothetical subject, and she the silliness of
 crying about what was written in an old book like the Bible.


---
" for now he was rather more ruffled than she. 
---
that man might be you
---
He thought of Arabella.


---
said Jude.


---
He looked away, for that epicene tenderness of hers. 
---
was he?
---
If he could only get over the sense of her sex,
---
he could
 scarcely believe.


---
that time, creed, or absence, would ever divide him
 from her
---
But his grief at her incredulities returned. 
---
he nodded in his chair likewise. 
---
Whenever
 he aroused himself.

---
he turned her things, and
---
About six o'clock he awoke completely, and. 
---
Her chair being a far more comfortable
 one than his
---
he went downstairs
---
When he returned
---
" Now could I get out without anybody seeing me?"
---
What Mr. Phillotson will say! 
---
It was quite by
 his wish that I went there. 
---
He is the only man in the world for whom
 I have any respect or fear. 
---
he'll forgive me
---
he'll scold
 me dreadfully
---
He may think
---
what he
 likes
---
At the last moment he persuaded her.


---
him make her a cup of
 coffee, in a portable apparatus he kept in his room for use on rising
 to go to his work every day before the household was astir
---
I shall stay there
, and I get back to the training- school
 again."

," he said;"
---
Jude accompanying her to the
 station. 
---
a head was thrust out
 of an upper window of his lodging and. 
---
him know as soon as she
 got re- admitted to the training- school
---
that he wanted
---
" I want
---
to tell you something-- two things," he said hurriedly. 
---
Jude's face became so full of complicated glooms that hers was
 agitated in sympathy as she bade him adieu through the carriage
 window. 
---
Melchester was a dismal place enough for Jude that Sunday of her
 departure, and the Close so hateful that he did not go once to the
 cathedral services. 
---
, dear Jude, is something I said
    to you at parting. 
---
what his answer was
---
how he
 thought. 
---
what he would have done
---
had he been free,
---
He felt.


---
he might have been pretty sure of his own victory
---
if
 it had come to a conflict between Phillotson and himself for the
 possession of her
---
Yet Jude was in danger of attaching more meaning to Sue's impulsive
 note than it really was intended to bear.


---
After the lapse of a few days he found. 
---
himself hoping
---
But he received no further communication; and
---
in the
 intensity of his solicitude he sent another note,.


---
that he
 should pay her a visit some Sunday,
---
He expected a reply on the second morning after despatching his
 missive; but
---
in a feverish state of anxiety
 about her he sent off three brief lines stating that he was coming
 the following day,.


---
for he felt sure something had happened
---
His first and natural thought had been; but
---
it soon occurred to him. 
---
Conjectures were put an end to by
 his arrival at the village school- house near Shaston on the bright
 morning of Sunday, between eleven and twelve o'clock, when the parish
 was as vacant as a desert,.


---
Jude entered and. 
---
a voice told him

---
On reaching the landing which way to turn-- the voice of Sue calling his name. 
---
He passed the
 doorway, and.


---
he cried,.

---
," he said simply;
---
" Yes, Sue" I am more than you think. 
---
I
 was quite aware that you did not suspect till within the last meeting
 or two what I was feeling about you. 
---
I admit. 
---
I deserve a
 little consideration for concealing my wrong, very wrong, sentiments,
 since I could n't help having them
---
that
 fitted the mood and the moment, under the suasion of which Sue's
 undemonstrative regard of him might not inconceivably have changed
 its temperature
---
Some men would have cast scruples to the winds,
 and. 
---
Jude did not. 
---
He had
---
It was upon his lips;
---
yet at the
 hour of this distress he could not disclose it. 
---
He preferred to
 dwell upon the recognized barriers between them.


---
-- I know you don't
---
" Of course-- care about me in any particular way,"
 he sorrowed. 
---
I suppose?"


---
he has been
---
that he has been
---
if he did n't come any more
---
if Jude's feelings of love were
 deprecated by her
---
He went on to something else.


---
"," he said. 
---
" I'll ask Mr. Phillotson,"
---
Jude left in the afternoon, hopelessly
 unhappy. 
---
But he had seen her, and. 
---
that he, as
 a parish priest, should learn
---
when he awoke
---
he felt rather vexed with her
---
he had begun
---
Jude,
    please still keep me as your friend and associate, with
    all my faults. 
---
Jude forgave her straightway, and.




---
Meanwhile a middle- aged man was dreaming a dream of great beauty
. 
---
He was Richard
 Phillotson, who had recently removed from the mixed village school at
 Lumsdon near Christminster, to undertake a large boys' school in his
 native town of Shaston, which stood on a hill
---
who,, might conduct one of the girls'
 schools adjoining his own
---
Essentially an unpractical man, he
 was now bent on making and saving money for a practical purpose-- that
 of keeping a wife,; for which purpose he had advised her,.


---
that Jude was removing from Marygreen to Melchester
---
, he had begun re- attempt some of his old studies-- one branch of
 which had included Roman- Britannic antiquities-- an unremunerative
 labour for a national school- master but a subject,; practicable to those who, like himself,
 had lived in lonely spots where these remains were abundant, and were
 seen to compel inferences in startling contrast to accepted views on
 the civilization of that time.


---
A resumption of this investigation was the outward and apparent hobby
 of Phillotson at present-- his ostensible reason for going alone into
 fields where causeways, dykes, and tumuli abounded, or shutting
 himself up in his house with a few urns, tiles, and mosaics he had
 collected, instead of calling round upon his new neighbours, who for
 their part had showed themselves willing enough to be friendly with
 him. 
---
when it had grown quite
 late-- to near midnight, indeed-- and the light of his lamp
---
Thus on a particular evening in the month,, shining
 from his window at a salient angle of the hill- top town over infinite
 miles of valley westward, announced as by words a place and person
 given over to study, he was not exactly studying.


---
The interior of the room-- the books, the furniture, the
 schoolmaster's loose coat, his attitude at the table, even the
 flickering of the fire, bespoke the same dignified tale of
 undistracted research-- more than creditable to a man who had had no
 advantages beyond those of his own making. 
---
What he was regarding
---
They were historic notes, written in a bold womanly
 hand at his dictation some months before, and
---
it was the clerical
 rendering of word after word that absorbed him.


---
He presently took from a drawer a carefully tied bundle of letters,
 few, very few, as correspondence counts nowadays. 
---
He unfolded them one by
 one and.
---
that it was honourable and generous of
 him
---
he would not come
---
that her engagement to him should not be known,
---
if he visited her often
---
that the man had not
 been often
---
The problem occupied him,.


---
He opened another drawer, and. 
---
from which
 he drew a photograph of Sue as a child,
---
long before he had known her,

---
It was
 a duplicate of the one she had given Jude, and. 
---
Phillotson brought it half- way to his lips, but
---
His speech was a little slow,
 but
---
his tones were sincere enough to make his hesitation no defect.

---
His greying hair was curly, and. 
---
There were four lines across his forehead, and
---
he only
 wore spectacles. 
---
It was almost certainly a
 renunciation forced upon him by his academic purpose, rather than a
 distaste for women, which had hitherto kept him from closing with one
 of the sex in matrimony.


---
Such silent proceedings as those of this evening were repeated many
 and oft times when he was not under the eye of the boys, whose quick
 and penetrating regard would frequently become almost intolerable to
 the self- conscious master in his present anxious care for Sue, making
 him, in the grey hours of morning, dread to meet anew the gimlet
 glances,.


---
what the dream within him was
---
He had honourably acquiesced in Sue's announced wish that he was
 not often to visit her at the training school; but
---
at length, his
 patience being sorely tried
---
, he set out one Saturday afternoon. 
---
There the news of her departure-- expulsion
-- was flashed upon him without
 warning or mitigation; and
---
as he stood at the door
---
when he turned away
---
he could hardly
 see the road before him.


---
A short reflection told him.


---
They had informed him at the school where she was living, and
---
having
 no immediate anxiety about her comfort, his thoughts took the
 direction of a burning indignation against the training school
 committee. 
---
In his bewilderment Phillotson entered the adjacent
 cathedral, just now in a direly dismantled state by reason of
 the repairs. 
---
He sat down on a block of freestone, regardless of
 the dusty imprint it made on his breeches; and his listless eyes
 following the movements of the workmen.


---
he presently became aware
 that the reputed culprit, Sue's lover Jude, was one amongst them
---
Jude had never spoken to his former hero since the meeting by the
 model of Jerusalem. 
---
Having inadvertently witnessed Phillotson's
 tentative courtship of Sue in the lane there had grown up in the
 younger man's mind a curious dislike to think of the elder, to meet
 him, to communicate in any way with him; and
---
since Phillotson's
 success in obtaining at least her promise had become
---
he had frankly recognized. 
---
that he did not wish,
---
again what excellencies might appertain to his character
---
Jude was expecting; and
---
when therefore he saw the schoolmaster in the nave
 of the building,
---
that he was coming
---
saw, moreover, to speak to him,
 he felt no little embarrassment;.


---
which Phillotson's own embarrassment
 prevented his observing
---
Jude joined him, and
---
they both withdrew from the other workmen to the
 spot where Phillotson had been sitting. 
---
Jude offered him a piece of
 sackcloth for a cushion, and.


---
" Yes; yes," said Phillotson abstractedly,. 
---
as he reseated himself,
---
his
 eyes resting on the ground
---
as if he were trying
---
where he
 was
---
" I wo n't keep you long. 
---
that I have heard
---
I merely want.
---
" I think!" 
---
I know what
---
Jude hurriedly said. 
---
" Well"-- Jude for a moment felt an unprincipled and fiendish wish to
. 
---
By the exercise of that treachery
 which love for the same woman renders possible to men the most
 honourable in every other relation of life, he could send off
 Phillotson in agony and defeat by saying that the scandal was true,
 and
---
But his
 action did not respond for a moment to his animal instinct; and
---
what
 he said
---
Phillotson trembled, and
---
his naturally pale face acquired a
 corpselike sharpness in its lines. 
---
" No, no!" said Jude aghast. 
---
" I thought? 
---
I mean
---
that
 were I in a position to marry her, or someone, and and"


---
there, I should be glad!
---
What he had really meant
---
that he loved her
---
Jude explained readily;.


---
his seeing her off next morning
---
" Well now," said Phillotson at the conclusion,"?"


---
I take it as your
 final word, and
---
I know
---
I can believe you,
---
"," said Jude solemnly. 
---
when Jude had taken him
 round, and
---
shown him some features of the renovation, Phillotson bade the young man good- day and

---
When Jude went to his dinner at one he saw his beloved
 ahead of him in the street leading up from the North Gate
---
he remarked

---
that he had asked her, and
---
" I have been an
 observation which he was expected to take as an answer,. 
---
he felt inclined to

---
" You have not seen Mr. Phillotson to- day?"
---
he ventured.


---
He stopped,.


---
, he thought,
---
that he must speak as
 an honest man
---
But he did not speak, and
---
he might have felt at what that implied, or
---
was nullified by his intention
---
he rested rigid
---
till he
 began
---
Jude looked up. 
---
He saw.


---
," he went on with a gloomy
 tongue. 
---
He would have preferred a more congenial
 spot, but,
---
as usually happens, in place of a romantic field or solemn
 aisle for his tale, it was told and amid all the usual
 squalors of decayed vegetable matter and unsaleable refuse. 
---
He
 began and. 
---
" No, dear darling!" cried Jude passionately. 
---
He tried, but
---
her eyes regarded him
 in estranged silence.


---
"," he continued. 
---
how wretched he was,
---
I had no
 feeling before that moment at the railway- station, except--" " Do n't cry, dear!" he implored.


---
he could
 not help. 
---
His momentary desire
 was the means of her rallying. 
---
It
 was distracting to Jude, and
---
his heart would have ached less
---
Their views of the relations of man and woman are,
. 
---
He could speak more freely now. 
---
My father used!"


---
yet Jude's last look into her
 eyes was tinged with inquiry,.




---
for he felt
---
that he did not even now
 quite know her mind
---
VII


 Tidings from Sue a day or two after passed across Jude like a
 withering blast.


---
he was led
---
that its contents
 were of a somewhat serious kind by catching sight of the
 signature-- which was in her full name, never used in her
 correspondence with him since her first note:


    MY DEAR JUDE,--
---
Mr. Phillotson and I are. 
---
But he generously says,
---
he does
    not see any object in waiting
---
It is so good of him,.

   
---
Jude staggered under the news;. 
---
because his mouth was so dry
---
Then presently he went
 back to his work and. 
---
he asked himself, and.


---
he said. 
---
as he worked
---
that his announcement of his own marriage had
 pricked her on to this, just as his visit to her when in liquor may
 have pricked her on to her engagement
---
he was compelled. 
---
that a pique at having his secret
 sprung upon her had moved her
---
He determined; but
---
he could not write the requested good wishes for a
 day or two. 
---
Meanwhile there came another note from his impatient
 little dear
---
I have nobody else who could
    do it so conveniently as you,. 
---
I have here on the spot
---
even if my father were friendly
    enough to be willing
---
which he is n't
---
I hope? 
---
I have been looking at the marriage service in
    the prayer- book, and
---
According to the
    ceremony, my bridegroom chooses me of his
    own will and pleasure; but
---
I do n't choose him. 
---
Somebody
    GIVES me to him, like a she- ass or she- goat, or any other
    domestic animal. 
---
But I forget: I am no longer privileged to tease
    you.--
---
Jude screwed himself up to heroic key; and
---
Of course I wish you joy! 
---
And also of course
    I will give you away. 
---
What I suggest
---
, I think,
   
---
since I am,, the person nearest related to you in
    this part of the world
---
I do n't see? 
---
What had jarred on him even more than the signature
---
he had been silent on
---
him seem as her lover
---
that in
 satire, he could hardly forgive her; if in suffering-- ah, that was
 another thing!


---
His offer of his lodging must have commended itself to Phillotson
 at any rate,. 
---
Jude immediately
 moved into more commodious quarters,.


---
Jude
 decided, after inquiry,.


---
Jude not
 going,
---
that he
 should not lose a morning's work and
---
But so well by this time did he know Sue. 
---
that the
 remembrance of their mutual sensitiveness at emotional crises might,
 he thought
---
When he came home to
 dinner she had taken possession of her apartment.


---
he did not know
---
Phillotson came
 frequently, but
---
mostly when Jude was absent. 
---
when Jude had given himself a holiday
---
Seeing,, how helpless he
 was in making the place comfortable
---
He was leaning with his elbows on the table and his chin on his
 hands,.


---
" You are' father',. 
---
what they call the man who gives
 you away
---
Jude could have said"!" 
---
Phillotson's age entitles him
---
But he would not annoy her by such a cheap retort.


---
before the meal was over both he and
---
What oppressed Jude was the thought that,
 having done a wrong thing of this sort himself, he was aiding and
 abetting the woman he loved in doing a like wrong thing, instead of
 imploring and warning her against it. 
---
It was on his tongue?"


---
," said Jude.


---
" I am going?"


---
" I should like."


---
Again he said to himself,"!"


---
He passively acquiesced in her wish to go in, and
---
his thoughts of a penance in store for her were tempered by an
 ache:


                          ...
---
I can find no way
    How a blow should fall, such as falls on men,
    Nor prove too much for your womanhood!



---
They strolled undemonstratively up the nave towards the altar
 railing, which they stood against in silence, turning then and
 walking down the nave again, her hand still on his arm, precisely
 like a couple just married. 
---
The too suggestive incident, entirely
 of her making, nearly broke down Jude.


---
" I like
---
"!" said Jude.


---
I shall walk down the church like this with my husband in
 about two hours
---
, sha n't I!"


---
The appeal was so remorseful that Jude's eyes were even wetter than
 hers as he pressed her hand for Yes.


---
There was nothing
 really to demur to in her leaning on Jude's arm; but
---
Jude thought.


---
that Phillotson had looked surprised
---
" How?" said Phillotson curiously.


---
Jude inwardly deplored;
 but
---
he thought
---
how puzzled Phillotson seemed
---
Seeing, Jude said as cheerfully as he
 could. 
---
," I am going
---
Jude soon joined them at his rooms, and
---
Phillotson's hair was brushed to a painful
 extent, and
---
his shirt collar appeared stiffer. 
---
Beyond this he looked dignified and
 thoughtful, and altogether a man of whom it was not unsafe to predict
 that he would make a kind and considerate husband. 
---
That he adored
; and
---
Although the distance was so short he had hired a fly from the Red
 Lion, and
---
though
 Jude was getting; and
---
Jude took from his pocket his extra little
 wedding- present,
---
which he threw over her bonnet and all
---
" Oh no-- let," said Phillotson. 
---
Jude found by the time they were half- way on with the
 service he wished from his heart that he had not undertaken the
 business of giving her away. 
---
He
 could perceive, and
---
when they reached
 the trying ordeal of Jude giving her to Phillotson
---
Phillotson seemed. 
---
to be surrounded by a mist which
 prevented his seeing the emotions of others
---
, Jude
 felt relieved.


---
The meal at his lodging was a very simple affair, and
---
Jude and the landlady offered.


---
Jude followed her back. 
---
VIII


 Jude wondered.


---
He could not stay in his silent lodging, and
.


---
that he might be tempted
---
he
 went upstairs,
---
But in the cathedral he seemed, and
---
, he fancied. 
---
that the clock struck the last of his working
 hours he threw down his tools and rushed homeward
---
he asked.


---
As he could claim the downstairs sitting- room till twelve o'clock

---
that night he sat in it all the evening; and
---
, he could not shake off
 the feeling that she would come back and sleep in the little room
 adjoining his own in which she had slept so many previous days. 
---
Gladly
 would he have compounded for the denial of her as a sweetheart and
 wife by having her live thus as a fellow- lodger and friend, even on
 the most distant terms. 
---
His supper still remained, and
---
spread going
 to the front door, and softly setting it open, he returned to the
 room and. 
---
he went upstairs
---
as that he beheld
---
He projected his mind into the future,
 and. 
---
But the consolation of regarding them as a continuation of
 her identity was denied to him, as to all such dreamers, by the
 wilfulness of Nature in not allowing issue from one parent alone.

---
" If at the estrangement or death of my lost love, I could go and
---
said Jude.

---
And then he again uneasily saw,, the scorn of Nature for man's finer emotions, and her
 lack of interest in his aspirations.


---
as he had latterly seen with more and
 more frequency
---
The oppressive strength of his affection for Sue showed itself on
 the morrow and following days yet more clearly. 
---
He could no longer
 endure the light of the Melchester lamps
---
Then he received news that his old
 aunt was dangerously ill at Marygreen, which intelligence almost
 coincided with a letter from his former employer at Christminster,
 who offered him permanent work of a good class if he would come back.

---
The letters were almost a relief to him. 
---
He started, and.


---
Jude found his aunt even worse than the communication from the Widow
 Edlin. 
---
He wrote
 to Sue informing her of the state of her aunt, and suggesting that
 she might like to see her aged relative alive. 
---
He would meet her at
 Alfredston Road, the following evening, Monday, on his way back from
 Christminster,. 
---
Next morning, according, he went on to
 Christminster,.


---
he had lost all
 feeling for its associations. 
---
Yet drew
 patterns of the crinkled battlements on the young turf of the
 quadrangles, Jude thought. 
---
he had never seen
---
He came to the street in which he had first beheld Sue.

---
The chair, her girlish figure had
 arrested the gaze of his inquiring eyes,. 
---
who had once moved him to emotion
---
However, here he was; and
---
in fulfilment of his intention he went on
 to his former lodging in" Beersheba," near the ritualistic church of
 St. Silas. 
---
The old landlady seemed glad to see
 him again, and
---
bringing some lunch informed him.


---
who
 had employed him
---
Jude went on to the stone- yard where he had worked. 
---
But the old
 sheds and bankers were distasteful to him
---
; he felt it impossible to
 engage himself to return and stay in this place of vanished dreams.

---
He longed for the hour of the homeward train to Alfredston, where he
 might probably meet Sue.


---
Then, for one ghastly half- hour of depression,
 there returned upon him; and
---
that feeling his undoing more
 than once-- that he was not worth the trouble of being taken care of
 either by himself or others
---
during this half- hour he met Tinker
 Taylor, the bankrupt ecclesiastical ironmonger, at Fourways,
---
They walked along the street, the inn wherein he
 formerly had responded to the challenge to rehearse the Creed in
 Latin-- now a popular tavern with a spacious and inviting entrance,
 which gave admittance to a bar that had been entirely renovated and
 refitted in modern style since Jude's residence here.


---
Tinker Taylor drank off his glass and,. 
---
for him to feel at home in
---
unless he was drunker

---
than he had money to be just then
---
Jude was longer finishing his,
 and. 
---
Feeling tired, and having nothing more to do,
 Jude sat down on one of the sofas. 
---
that Jude did not know the name
 of,
---
The barmaid attending to this compartment was invisible to Jude's
 direct glance,. 
---
though a reflection of her back in the glass behind
 her was occasionally caught by his eyes
---
He had only observed this
 listlessly,. 
---
Then he was amazed to discover that the face was
 Arabella's.


---
all this being visible to him only in the mirror behind her;
---
which
 also reflected the faces of the men she was attending to-- one of them
 a handsome, dissipated young fellow, possibly an undergraduate, who
 had been relating to her an experience of some humorous sort
---
As the young man was clean shaven
---
,
 the retort provoked a laugh at his expense.


---
" Come!" said he,"."


---
I'll have a curaçao; and a light, please
---
a match held it to his cigarette with ministering archness while he
 whiffed.


---
" Well, have you heard from your husband lately, my dear?
---
" he asked.


---
" Where is he?"


---
he's there still
---
Jude's eyes grew.


---
" What made you part from him?"


---
he bade her good- bye and.


---
Jude had looked on with the eye of a dazed philosopher. 
---
He could not realize their nominal closeness. 
---
And,, in his present frame of mind he was indifferent to the fact
 that Arabella was his wife indeed.


---
The compartment emptied itself of visitors, and
 after a brief thought he entered it, and.

---
" Thanks, Arabella," said Jude without a smile. 
---
that her unexpected
 presence there had destroyed at a stroke his momentary taste for
 strong liquor as completely as if it had whisked him back to his
 milk- fed infancy
---
He observed
.


---
" So you pass as having a living husband
---
," he continued.


---
I thought."


---
if I called myself a widow,
---
as I
 should have liked
---
I am known here a little."


---
I did n't mean on that account-- for
---
He reflected and. 
---
Depositing his unemptied glass he went out and. 
---
Here was a rude flounce into the pellucid sentimentality of
 his sad attachment to Sue. 
---
, he thought. 
---
there might be some truth in her
 implication that she had not wished to disturb him, and had really
 supposed him dead
---
as he had promised
---
wherein he avoided the precincts of every
 cloister and hall
---
because he could not bear
---
Passing the evening, therefore, in a desultory
 waiting about the town, to behold them, he
 repaired to the tavern bar. 
---
while the hundred and one strokes were
 resounding from the Great Bell of Cardinal College, a coincidence
 which seemed to him gratuitous irony
---
The bar had been crowded with men of all sorts during the previous
 hour, and
---
he had heard from without the hubbub of their voices; but

---
He nodded to Arabella, and.


---
He also drank his, and.


---
" Oh-- none in particular," he answered, thoroughly sick and tired,. 
---
his
 thoughts again reverting to Alfredston, and the train he did not go
 by; the probable disappointment of Sue that he was not there when
 she arrived, and the missed pleasure of her company on the long and
 lonely climb by starlight up the hills to Marygreen
---
" I ought to
! 
---
, I fear.
---
"

" I'll go over with you to- morrow morning. 
---
I think."


---
I could get a day
 off
---
There was something particularly uncongenial in the idea of Arabella,
 who had no more sympathy than a tigress with his relations or him,
. 
---
Yet he
 said,".
---
I am getting known,
---
till I get two or three things
---
when late I sleep at the hotel where I am engaged
---
Jude looked up the far
 highway.


---
he murmured at last.


---
said Jude impatiently. 
---
" Of course I do n't
 want."


---
Whenever I met him out for a walk
---
" Yes-- yes-- I promise!"", he used, and
---
that he was much

---
he kept. 
---
I never
 thought of coming back to England again; and
---
being out there in
 Australia, with no home of my own after leaving my father, I at last
 agreed, and."


---
" What-- marry him?"


---
till shortly before I left
---
I know
---
I did! 
---
There, now I've told you. 
---
He talks of coming back to England, poor old chap. 
---
if he does
---
But,
 he wo n't be likely to find me."


---
Jude stood pale and fixed.


---
he said.


---
" Well-- I did n't... 
---
you meant him
---
" I have nothing more to say!"
---
" I have nothing at all
 to say about the-- crime
---
Well, that I shall go back
 to him! 
---
He was very fond of me, and
---
How did I know
?"


---
" I wo n't go. 
---
I could say a good deal; but
---
I shall think over
, and."


---
Jude watched, and. 
---
that
 it wanted three- quarters of an hour of the time at which he could
 get a train back to Alfredston
---
Finding, he strolled mechanically into the
 city as far as to the Fourways, where he stood as he had so often
 stood before, and; the lines
 of the buildings being as distinct in the morning air as in an
 architectural drawing. 
---
But Jude was far from seeing or criticizing
 these things
---
; they were hidden by an indescribable consciousness of
 Arabella's midnight contiguity, a sense of degradation at his revived
 experiences with her, of her appearance as she lay asleep at dawn,
 which set upon his motionless face a look as of one accurst. 
---
If he
 could only have felt resentment towards her
---
he would have been less
 unhappy; but
---
he pitied.


---
while he contemned her
---
Jude turned and. 
---
Drawing again towards the
 station he started at hearing his name. 
---
that he had ever
 had,
---
Looking at his loved one, in his tender
 thought the sweetest and most disinterested comrade living largely in vivid imaginings, so ethereal a creature
 trembling through her limbs, he felt
 heartily ashamed of his earthliness in spending the hours he had
 spent in Arabella's company. 
---
There was something rude and immoral
 in thrusting these recent facts of his life upon the mind of one who,
 to him, was so uncarnate as to seem at times impossible as a human
 wife to any average man. 
---
as he
 regarded her to- day
---
" he said. 
---
I
 wonder... 
---
He was not so sure that she had been frightened about his morals for
 nothing. 
---
He released her hand,--
---
it
 seemed the same carriage he had lately got out of with another-- where
 they sat down side by side,
---
He
 regarded the delicate lines of her profile, and the small, tight,
 applelike convexities of her bodice, so different from Arabella's
 amplitudes. 
---
he was looking at her
---
But I wish"

" Jude--
---
-- I wish!"
---
He knew that, and. 
---
At an inn," though it would have been
 a relief to tell her of his meeting with an unexpected one
---
But the
 latter's final announcement of her marriage in Australia bewildered
 him.


---
what he might say
---
lest should do his ignorant wife an injury
---
he wanted
---
-- he could not say why.

---
though he had with another
---
as if he carried a bright
 light
---
Jude noticed. 
---
At length he inquired.


---
if her husband were well
---
" He is obliged,
 or
---
he would have come with me. 
---
He is so good and kind that
---
to
 accompany me he would have dismissed the school for once, even
 against his principles-- for he is strongly opposed to giving casual
 holidays--
---
his being
 almost a stranger to her now would have made it irksome to both.

---
Jude had walked moodily. 
---
while this praise of Phillotson was being
 expressed
---
" Mr. Phillotson obliges you in everything,
---
as he ought
---
,"
 he said.


---
" And of course I am."


---
" Bride, I might almost have said, as yet.  since I gave you to him"

" Yes, I know!  I know!"  There was something in her face which belied
 her late assuring words, so strictly proper and so lifelessly spoken
 that they might have been taken from a list of model speeches in" The
 Wife's Guide to Conduct." 
---
Jude knew the quality of every vibration
 in Sue's voice,
---
he was,. 
---
" No, you are not Mrs. Phillotson
---
he said,.


---
in which Jude and Arabella had lived and

---
, between the
 Brown House and Marygreen, quarrelled, he turned. 
---
He could not help. 
---
I brought her
 home to that house."


---
" Yes; but I was not very happy there."


---
how he was taking it
---
" Of course I
 may have exaggerated your happiness--
---
," he continued
 blandly.


---
that, Jude, for a moment, even though you may have said
 it
---
He's as good to me as a man can be, and
---
I am not happy
---
because he's too old for me
---
" I do n't think anything against him-- to you."


---
" I will not."


---
He said no more, but
---
he knew.


---
wherein Jude had received a thrashing from
 the farmer many years earlier
---
I do not know!"


---
' ee marry him?
---
you loved the man
---
-- there be certain men
 here and there that no woman of any niceness can stomach. 
---
he was one
---
Jude followed her, and.


---
what I SHOULD have said" Do n't cry, dear!" said Jude in distress. 
---
" God-- what-- you do n't like him?"
---
He wondered.

---
to depart, Jude hiring a neighbour to
 drive her to Alfredston.


---
" he said.


---
The man came round with the trap, and
---
Jude
 helped her into it, perhaps with unnecessary attention,.


---
I suppose--?
---
I may come,
---
when I am back again at
 Melchester
---
" to see you some day" he half- crossly observed.


---
I do n't think."


---
" Very well," said Jude. 
---
I wo n't go!
---
" he murmured.


---
He passed the evening and
---
He read sermons on discipline, and. 
---
Before
 he had returned from Marygreen to Melchester
---
The sight of it revived a stronger feeling of
 self- condemnation for his brief return to her society than for his
 attachment to Sue.


---
, he perceived,
---
He had come to England on purpose to find her;
 and.


---
where he
 wished
---
As he had said
---
that he loved her very much still, and
---
as he urged
---
he would not turn upon her, a weak woman, and
---
X


 Jude returned to Melchester, which had the questionable
 recommendation of being only a dozen and a half miles from his Sue's
 now permanent residence. 
---
At first he felt; but
---
Jude did not pause.


---
He now returned with feverish desperation to his study for the
 priesthood-- in the recognition that the single- mindedness of his
 aims, and
---
his fidelity to the cause, had been more than questionable
 of late. 
---
His passion for Sue troubled his soul
---
; yet his lawful
 abandonment to the society of Arabella for twelve hours seemed
 instinctively a worse thing--. 
---
He had
---
, he verily believed,
---
which, indeed, he had never done from
 taste,
---
Yet
 he perceived with despondency
---
, he was a man of
 too many passions to make a good clergyman
---
he could hope

---
As a hobby, auxiliary to his readings in Divinity, he developed his
 slight skill in church- music and thorough- bass,. 
---
till he could join in
 part- singing from notation with some accuracy
---
A mile or two from
 Melchester there was a restored village church, to which Jude had
 originally gone to fix the new columns and capitals. 
---
By this means
 he had become acquainted with the organist, and
---
that he joined the choir as a bass voice
---
He walked out to this parish twice every Sunday, and sometimes in the
 week. 
---
which Jude had heard of as being by a Wessex composer
---
again its harmonies grew upon Jude, and.


---
he went round to the organist. 
---
" He is a local man. 
---
He is a professional
 musician at Kennetbridge-- between here and Christminster. 
---
The
 vicar knows him. 
---
He was brought up and. 
---
he
 plays in the large church there, and
---
He comes
 to Melchester sometimes, and. 
---
As he walked humming the air on his way home
---
, Jude fell to musing
 on its composer, and the reasons why he composed it. 
---
What a man of
 sympathies he must be! 
---
as he himself was
 about Sue and Arabella
---
as was his conscience by the
 complication of his position
---
Perplexed and harassed, and troubled, he would like!

---
" He of all men would understand my difficulties
---
," said the impulsive
 Jude. 
---
for he must have suffered,
 and
---
as he could afford the time and money for the journey
---
In brief, ill,
 Fawley resolved, like the child that he was,. 
---
He duly started, early in the morning,. 
---
that he could get to the
 town
---
About mid- day he reached it, and
---
he inquired for the house of the composer.


---
They told him.

---
Jude hastened on, and. 
---
soon had the pleasure of observing a man in a
 black coat and a black slouched felt hat no considerable distance
 ahead
---
Stretching out his legs yet more widely, he stalked after.

---
" A hungry soul in pursuit of a full soul!" he said. 
---
" I must speak
 to that man!"


---
He could not, however, overtake the musician, and. 
---
before he had entered
 his own house
---
Whether or not he decided, now

---
that he had got here
---
, the distance home being too great for him
---
This man of soul would understand
 scant ceremony, and.


---
which an earthly and illegitimate passion had cunningly obtained
 entrance into his heart through the opening afforded for religion
---
Jude accordingly rang the bell, and.


---
The musician came to him in a moment, and
---
being respectably dressed,
 good- looking, and frank in manner, Jude obtained a favourable
 reception. 
---
He was nevertheless conscious that there would be a
 certain awkwardness in explaining his errand.


---
" I have been singing in the choir of a little church near
 Melchester
---
," he said. 
---
which I understand, sir
---
" I did-- a year or so ago."


---
I think it supremely beautiful!"


---
He handed Jude an advertisement list of several pages in booklet
 shape,. 
---
with which he purposed
---
It took Jude
 more than by surprise that the man with the soul was thus and thus;
 and
---
he felt.


---
that he could not open up his confidences
---
that Jude was a poor man his manner changed from what it had

---
while Jude's appearance and address deceived him as to his
 position and pursuits
---
Jude stammered out something about his
 feelings in wishing to congratulate the author on such an exalted
 composition, and.


---
All the way home by the slow Sunday train, sitting in the fireless
 waiting- rooms on this cold spring day, he was depressed enough at
 his simplicity in taking such a journey. 
---
But no sooner did he reach
. 
---
his Melchester lodging
---
than he found
---
after he had left the house
---
It
 was a contrite little note from Sue, in which she said, with sweet
 humility, that she felt she had been horrid in telling him he
 was not to come to see her, that she despised herself for having
 been so conventional; and that he was to be sure to come by the
 eleven- forty- five train that very Sunday, and have dinner with them
 at half- past one.


---
Jude almost tore his hair at having missed this letter till it was
 too late to act upon its contents; but
---
he had chastened himself
 considerably of late, and. 
---
which he had noticed in himself more
 than once of late
---
him pass over in ridicule the idea that God
 sent people on fools' errands
---
He longed
---
to see her; he was angry
 at having missed her: and
---
he wrote instantly,, but.


---
he had not enough patience to wait till the
 following Sunday
---
Since he wrote a little over- ardently
---
he
 might come that afternoon
---
if he wished,
---
this being the earliest day
 on which she could welcome him,
---
" Whoso prefers either Matrimony or other Ordinance before
     the Good of Man and the plain Exigence of Charity,
---
what he will
---
, he
     is no better than a Pharisee."--
---
Vague imaginings of its castle, its three mints, its magnificent
 apsidal abbey, the chief glory of South Wessex, its twelve churches,
 its shrines, chantries, hospitals, its gabled freestone mansions-- all
 now ruthlessly swept away-- throw the visitor, even against his will,
 into a pensive melancholy, which the stimulating atmosphere and
 limitless landscape around him can scarcely dispel. 
---
as the medicinal air is to his lungs
---
It was to this breezy and whimsical spot that Jude ascended from the
 nearest station for the first time in his life about four o'clock one
 afternoon, and. 
---
he withdrew a few
 steps along Abbey Walk, whence he regarded the spot which fate had
 made the home of all he loved best in the world. 
---
Within the mullioned and transomed windows he
 could see the black, brown, and flaxen crowns of the scholars over
 the sills, and.


---
he walked down to the level
 terrace where the abbey gardens once had spread
---
, his heart throbbing
 in spite of him
---
Unwilling to enter he remained here

---
he found
---
that he
 had waited too long, and
---
, Mr. Phillotson having been absent all the
 afternoon at a teachers' meeting at Shottsford.


---
Jude went into the empty schoolroom and. 
---
that Mrs. Phillotson would be
 back again in a few minutes
---
A piano stood near-- actually the old
 piano that Phillotson had possessed at Marygreen-- and though the dark
 afternoon almost prevented him seeing the notes Jude touched them in
 his humble way, and could not help modulating into the hymn which had
 so affected him in the previous week.


---
A figure moved behind him, and
---
Jude took no notice,. 
---
The imposed hand was a
 little one he seemed to know, and he turned.


---
her rendering of the piece, though not remarkable,
 seemed divine as compared with his own. 
---
he moved his hand towards hers
---
, it met his own
 half- way.
---
Jude grasped it--.


---
just as he had done before her marriage
---
that the composer of that hymn is one of the most commonplace men I
 ever met
---
" What-- you know him?"


---
"," he said drily.


---
He waited in the light of the stove, the door of which she flung open
 before going out, and
---
" Yes," said Jude.


---
The kettle of his gift sang with some satire in its note, to his
 mind; and
---
to change the subject he said,"? 
---
I am not familiar with it now,. 
---
though I was interested in it
---
His thoughts, however reverted with
 a twinge to the" former friend"-- by whom she meant, as he knew, the
 university comrade of her earlier days. 
---
He wondered.


---
I am reading Divinity harder than ever."


---
said Jude.


---
" I am sure you can tell me anything I may be ignorant of in that
 subject. 
---
Shall I come and? 
---
I could come any afternoon by train for half an
 hour?"


---
" I did n't know that. 
---
I thought!"


---
" No, I am not."


---
" What have I done, then? 
---
I am sure I thought we two--"  The

---
" Sue, I sometimes think
---
," said he abruptly.


---
" I ca n't talk to you any longer, Jude!"
---
when he went out now
---
He had hardly gone
 from the door. 
---
beneath which he was passing
 in the path without
---
He looked up in some surprise. 
---
You are Joseph the dreamer of
 dreams, dear Jude. 
---
And sometimes you
 are St. Stephen, who, while they were stoning him, could see Heaven
 opened. 
---
so that he could not
 get at her
---
" Yes!" said Jude. 
---
Jude said good- bye,
 and.


---
Passing along Bimport Street he thought. 
---
he heard the wheels of the
 coach departing, and, truly enough, when he reached the Duke's Arms
 in the Market Place the coach had gone
---
for him
 to get to the station on foot in time for this train
---
he settled
 himself perforce to wait for the next-- the last to Melchester that
 night.


---
He wandered about awhile,. 
---
, his feet involuntarily took him
 through the venerable graveyard of Trinity Church, with its avenues
 of limes, in the direction of the schools again
---
He could see the interior clearly-- the floor
 sinking a couple of steps below the road without, which had become
 raised during the centuries since the house was built. 
---
whose walls were lined with wainscoting
 of panelled oak reaching from floor to ceiling
---
he could see her face distinctly, and
---
Jude turned away. 
---
"" he said. 
---
He
 had once given her his; but
---
, he knew. 
---
Yet it was his,
 surely?


---
He knew.

---
he should go,
---
he read of
---
Those earnest men, the saints,, would have shunned such encounters
. 
---
But he could not. 
---
He might fast
 and but
---
the human was more powerful
 in him than the Divine.




---
He knew her mood, the look of her face,
. 
---
But, whatever her mood, he
 could not say.
---
He replied:


   . 
---
I acquiesce
---
He despatched the note on Easter Eve, and
---
On Easter Monday morning he received a message from the
 Widow Edlin, whom he had directed to telegraph if anything serious
 happened:


    Your aunt is sinking. 
---
He threw down his tools and. 
---
Three and a half hours later he
 was crossing the downs about Marygreen, and.

---
As he ascended on the other side a labouring man, who had been
 watching his approach from a gate across the path
---
" I can see in his face
---
,"
 said Jude. 
---
as he had supposed
---
Mrs. Edlin had sent out the man to
.


---
;
," said he.


---
Jude went on to the house, and
---
in the afternoon, gone, he sat
 down alone in the silent place. 
---
He wrote in the briefest terms:


   .
   
---
He remained in and about Marygreen through the intervening days,
. 
---
Having
 timed her by her only possible train, he locked the door about
 mid- day, and.

---
crossed the hollow field to the verge of the upland by
 the Brown House, where he stood and looked over the vast prospect
 northwards, and over the nearer landscape in which Alfredston stood
---
till he would know
---
He did wait, however, and
---
He knew her; and
---
he knew. 
---
having descended a little way, he met her.


---
" I thought,
---
And so-- at the last
 moment-- I came."


---
Jude would have paused, and. 
---
Her eyes met his, and.


---
he guessed things--"merely? 
---
Jude threw a troubled look at her. 
---
He said,:". 
---
which I hope,
---
I am
---
I fear. 
---
I am not
---
-- I should say, yes
---
Speaking from experience and
 unbiased nature, I should say, no.... 
---
Sue, I believe!"


---
" Of course I am!
---
But I have. 
---
, I suppose?
---
Shall I go to the train with you?"


---
" I think not. 
---
Jude went to the widow's house adjoining,
---
he said
 abruptly, with his eyes bent to the floor.


---
" I ca n't tell you all my part of the gloom. 
---
I saw it, but

---
I thought. 
---
I must n't interfere
---
I was wrong. 
---
I ought!
---
Because-- I can see you through your feathers, my poor little bird
---
Jude put his upon it. 
---
", Sue," cried he," after what we've been talking about!

---
I am more strict and formal than you,!"


---
But it may be bothering him needlessly.
---
just as you live with your husband
---
He is considerate to me in
 everything; and
---
he is very interesting, from the amount of general
 knowledge he has acquired by reading everything that comes in his
 way.... 
---
that a man ought
---
He gave her no opportunity of self- satisfaction, and
---
Jude could hardly speak, but
---
he said,"! 
---
I thought
---
Oh, I thought!"


---
, I suppose... 
---
is the necessity
 of being responsive to this man whenever he wishes, good as he is
 morally!--the dreadful contract to feel in a particular way in a
 matter whose essence is its voluntariness!... 
---
I wish! 
---
he would beat
 me, or
---
that I could talk

---
as I do
---
But he does nothing,
 except that he has grown a little cold since he has found out how I
 feel. 
---
why he did n't come to the funeral
---
Oh, I am very
 miserable
---
-- I do n't know!... 
---
But he had jumped up and.


---
" I told you not to, Jude!"


---
I know
---
"-- I only wish to--! 
---
Jude did not follow her. 
---
Twenty minutes later he
 saw her cross the village green towards Mrs. Edlin's, and
---
In the lonely room of his aunt's house, Jude sat.

---
He knew; and.


---
He retired, but
---
his sleep was fitful from the sense
. 
---
when
 he was beginning
---
At some time near two o'clock, to sleep more soundly, he was aroused by a shrill
 squeak that had been familiar enough to him when he lived regularly
 at Marygreen. 
---
who in his childhood had saved the lives of the earthworms now

---
He began.

---
Jude
 could rest no longer. 
---
till he had put it out of its pain
---
quickly he descended, and
---
He reached the hedge
 bordering the widow's garden,. 
---
when he stood still
---
he struck the rabbit on the back of the neck
 with the side of his palm
---
He was turning away.

---
when he saw
---
" Jude!" said a voice timidly--
---
" I have n't been able to sleep at all, and
---
then I heard the rabbit,
 and! 
---
till I felt
---
I must
 come down and
---
But I am so glad you got there first... 
---
Jude had reached the window, which was quite a low one,. 
---
" he said.


---
" No-- I was awake."


---
I know you,. 
---
as I did you
---
I wish!"


---
I
 had n't, now
---
" Do n't wish it, dear," he said. 
---
" I knew it--
---
I knew it! 
---
why I vowed
---
I would n't disturb
 your belief
---
But-- I am SO GLAD to see you!--and,
---
oh, I did n't mean

---
Jude seized her hand and. 
---
he said. 
---
" I'll never care about my doctrines or my religion any
 more! 
---
even if I do love you, and even
 if you
---
I ca n't admit so much as
 that. 
---
" I wish,!"


---
whatever I may be
---
" I CAN'T be! 
---
if I had been able to tell it to anybody else
---
But
 I have nobody. 
---
And I MUST tell somebody! 
---
before I married
 him
---
Jude, I had never thought out fully. 
---
even though I
 knew
---
I was old enough,
 and
---
I thought. 
---
I was very experienced
---
So I rushed on,, with all the cock- sureness of the
 fool that I was!... 
---
when I had got
 into that training school scrape
---
I am certain one ought to be allowed to undo
 what one had done so ignorantly! 
---
I daresay
---
I kick... 
---
How I wish"


---
-- I wish--"

"
---
so that he could
 not put his arms round her,
---
as otherwise he unquestionably would have

---
he returned to his cottage.




---
An hour passed before
 he returned along the same route, and
---
in his face there was a look of
 exaltation not unmixed with recklessness. 
---
that it was hardly proper of him as a parson in
 embryo
---
as he
 now wished
---
No: he would not. 
---
it was with flushed cheeks on her side, and a beating heart on his.


---
The kiss was a turning- point in Jude's career. 
---
Back again in the
 cottage, and left to reflection, he saw one thing:. 
---
that though
 his kiss of that aerial being had seemed the purest moment of his
 faultful life,
---
as he nourished this unlicensed tenderness it

---
for him to pursue the idea of becoming the
 soldier and servant of a religion in which sexual love was regarded
 as at its best a frailty, and at its worst damnation
---
When to defend
 his affection tooth and nail, to persist with headlong force in
 impassioned attentions to her, was all he thought of,
---
he was

---
He was as unfit, obviously, by nature,,.


---
as he had been by
 social position
---
that his first aspiration-- towards academical
 proficiency-- had been checked by a woman, and
---
that his second
 aspiration-- towards apostleship-- had also been checked by a woman
---
," he said,";
---
It had been his standing desire to become a prophet, however humble,
 to his struggling fellow- creatures, without any thought of personal
 gain. 
---
with a wife living away from him with another husband, and
 himself in love erratically, the loved one's revolt against her state
 being possibly on his account
---
Yet, he had sunk.


---
for him to consider further
---
: he had.


---
that he had made himself quite an impostor as a
 law- abiding religious teacher
---
At dusk that evening he went into the garden and. 
---
to which he brought out all the theological and ethical works that
 he possessed, and had stored here
---
He knew. 
---
even if he should sacrifice a little money to the sentiment of
 thus destroying them
---
,
 he cut the volumes into pieces as well as, and
---
he could
---
Though he was almost a stranger here now
---
, passing cottagers talked to
 him over the garden hedge.


---
" Burning up your awld aunt's rubbidge, I suppose? 
---
as he
 turned and, the sense of being
 no longer a hypocrite to himself afforded his mind a relief which
 gave him calm
---
He might go on, but
---
he professed
 nothing, and
---
no longer owned and exhibited engines of faith,
 as their proprietor, he might naturally be supposed. 
---
In his passion for Sue he could not stand as
 an ordinary sinner, and not as a whited sepulchre.


---
him kiss her
---
Jude ought. 
---
that he was not a
 lover
---
" I have been too weak
---
, I think!
---
And I wo n't write to him any more, or at least
 for a long time,! 
---
And I hope and the
 next, and the next, and no letter coming. 
---
it will
 hurt him very much--,
---
He'll suffer then with
 suspense-- won't he, that's all!--and
---
I am very glad of it!"--Tears
 of pity for Jude's approaching sufferings at her hands mingled with
 those which had surged up in pity for herself.


---
Phillotson met her at the arrival station, and,
---
He began. 
---
whom he
 had not seen for years
---
how his friend Gillingham, a neighbouring schoolmaster, had called upon him
---
Mr. Fawley hold my hand a long while
---
He, waking apparently from thoughts of far different mould, said
 vaguely,"? 
---
" I do n't know. 
---
He wanted to, and
---
I let him."


---
" I hope. 
---
it pleased him
---
I should think."


---
, he might have entered on his notes the curious fact
 that Sue had placed the minor for the major indiscretion, and had not
 said a word about the kiss.


---
Phillotson sat
---
When
 Phillotson arrived upstairs, weary with the drudgery of the
 attendance- numbers
---
Entering
 their chamber,, he went
 to the window, and,. 
---
He was musing,. 
---
" I think,
---
" he said at last,
 without turning his head,"
---
that I must get
---
he went on:

"
---
As the silence seemed more absolute than ordinarily he turned round.

---
he said().


---
gone downstairs for a moment to
 see to it, he pulled off his coat and
---
when, finding, he went out upon the
 landing, candle in hand, and
---
" I am not sleepy;
---
I am reading; and
---
He went to bed. 
---
Some time in the night he awoke. 
---
he hastily stepped out upon the landing
---
he could not at first understand
---
Phillotson, alarmed, went towards it,.


---
" he asked.


---
I came here,."


---
" Oh no, I think not. 
---
" But--"  Phillotson seized the knob and. 
---
which broke at his pull
---
When he looked in upon her
---
that he was quite worried
---
He said:"!"


---
I've been kind to you, and; and
---
" I know that! 
---
, I suppose! 
---
I am very sorry. 
---
Am I?"


---
" No-- I do n't know! 
---
, I suppose--
---
( He meant the servant.) 
---
I hate such eccentricities, Sue. 
---
But I wo n't intrude on
 you further
---
; only I would advise you- morrow."


---
I shall find
---
On rising the next morning he immediately looked into the closet, but

---
he said
 bitterly.


---
He found, and
---
" HE would n't have inquired!"
---
For a man and woman to live on intimate
 terms is adultery, in any circumstances,
 however legal. 
---
Phillotson writhed.


---
Do you mind my saying that I have guessed what never
 once occurred to me before our marriage-- that you were in love, and
 are in love, with Jude Fawley!"


---
The ringing of the school bell saved Phillotson from the necessity of
 replying at present to what apparently did not strike him as being
 such a convincing_ argumentum ad verecundiam_ as she, in her loss of
 courage at the last moment, meant it to appear. 
---
that he was ready to throw in with her
 other little peculiarities the extremest request which a wife could
 make
---
They proceeded to the schools that morning as usual, Sue entering
 the class- room, where he could see the back of her head through the
 glass partition whenever he turned his eyes that way. 
---
As he went on
 giving and hearing lessons his forehead and eyebrows twitched from
 concentrated agitation of thought
---
, till at length he tore a scrap
 from a sheet of scribbling paper and. 
---
He folded the piece of paper very small, and. 
---
Phillotson saw the bend of her
 pretty head as she read it. 
---
He could not see
 her hands, but
---
In a few minutes, however, one of Sue's
 class appeared, with a little note similar to his own. 
---
Phillotson looked more disturbed than before, and
---
the meeting- place
 of his brows twitched again. 
---
In ten minutes he called up the child
 he had just sent to her, and dispatched another missive:


   
---
me go to him
---
To this he returned no answer.


---
then he returned an answer:


    I do not wish to pain you. 
---
All day Phillotson bent a dazed regard upon her through the glazed
 partition; and
---
he felt as lonely as when he had not known her.


---
But he was as good as his word, and. 
---
IV


 Phillotson was sitting up late,. 
---
For the first time since reviving the subject he felt a
 return of his old interest in it. 
---
He forgot time and place, and
---
when
 he remembered himself and.


---
His preoccupation was.

---
though he now slept on the other
 side of the house
---
such that,, he mechanically went to the room that he and his
 wife had occupied when he first became a tenant of Old- Grove Place,
 which since his differences with Sue had been hers exclusively
---
He entered, and.


---
where he was he perceived Sue half- awake,
---
in a moment he heard. 
---
Before he had thought. 
---
he heard.


---
Phillotson, horrified, ran downstairs,. 
---
he ascended

---
there on the
 gravel before him lay a white heap. 
---
Phillotson seized it in his
 arms, and.


---
where he
 gazed at her by the flapping light of the candle which he had set
 down in the draught on the bottom stair
---
I know I beg
    you to; I implore!  I would not ask if I
    were not almost compelled by what I ca n't bear!  But I wo n't trifle!
    even though I have not been kind to you I
    will go away,.


 How well you KNOW I do n't! I am.


 I do not deserve your
    kindness.


 not much hurt I hope?"

" I was asleep, I think!", her pale face still turned away
 from him. 
---
the wretched
 Phillotson flung. 
---
I thought
 I saw you--" " Shall I help you upstairs?" he asked
 drearily;
---
I am very little hurt. 
---
I can walk.
---
," he mechanically said,
---
I have tried
---
Phillotson did not approach her, or. 
---
till he
 heard
---
Then he fastened up the front door, and

---
Thus he remained for a
 long long time-- a pitiable object enough to one who had seen him;
 till, raising his head and sighing a sigh which seemed to say that
 the business of his life must be carried on, whether he had a wife or

---
no, he took the candle and.


---
, Phillotson
 walked out of Shaston,. 
---
he required no tea, and
---
where he was going
---
He descended from the town level by a steep
 road in a north- westerly direction, and.

---
He was now on the low alluvial beds


   .



---
More than once he looked back in the increasing obscurity of evening.

---
one of which windows was his own
---
he could

---
when he had walked a
 mile or two
---
so that he was obliged
---
he proceeded without hesitation
 through the shade
---
as a man goes on, night or day
---
which he has played as a boy
---
He had walked altogether about four
 and a half miles


   
---
when he crossed a tributary of the Stour, and.


---
where he went
 on to the boys' school, and
---
A boy pupil- teacher opened it, and to Phillotson's inquiry,. 
---
if Mr.
 Gillingham was at home
---
that he was, going at once off to his
 own house, and
---
as he could
---
He
 discovered. 
---
his friend putting away some books
---
from which he had been

---
The light of the paraffin lamp fell on
 Phillotson's face-- pale and wretched by contrast with his friend's,
 who had a cool, practical look. 
---
Phillotson advanced without replying, and
---
I called,, but
---
that I have been waiting
---
I am glad you did n't wait, however."


---
" I've come, George,,... 
---
that I am about to take
---
You do n't mean-- anything wrong between you and Mrs.
 Phillotson?
---
" I do... 
---
that I've a wife I love who not
 only does not love me, but--
---
Well, I wo n't say. 
---
I know her

---
I should prefer hatred from her!"


---
I took advantage of
 her inexperience, and. 
---
though her exact
 feeling for him is a riddle to me-- and to him too
---
" Yes; with a curious tender solicitude seemingly;, I think-- possibly
 to herself. 
---
However,
 I have been struck with these two facts; the extraordinary sympathy,
 or similarity, between the pair. 
---
He is her cousin, which perhaps
 accounts for some of it. 
---
I can not bear it
---
-- I can not! 
---
I ca n't answer her arguments
---
I wo n't go into it
---
I have come to a conclusion
---
I wo n't be the inhuman
 wretch to do it,!"


---
I shall let; with him certainly,
 if she wishes. 
---
I know
---
I may be wrong--
---
I know I ca n't logically,
 or religiously
---
I was brought up in
---
Only I know one
 thing
---
I am doing wrong in refusing
 her
---
if a husband gets such
 a so- called preposterous request from his wife
---
that, the only course that
 can possibly be regarded as right and proper and honourable in him is

---
I do n't profess
. 
---
I simply am going, and. 
---
I only see

---
" Well-- I do n't agree with your instinct, Dick!
---
if
 one has any manliness or chivalry in him
---
It is not the same thing at
 all as the treachery of living on with a husband and playing him
 false... 
---
" I am thankful to say I have n't."

" Then I do n't think.  I
 have been that man, and I had not the remotest
 idea-- living apart from women as I have done for so many years--!"

" Well, I could admit some excuse for letting her leave you, as I believe though I think I did not mean that in
 the first jealous weeks of my marriage, before I had come to my right
 mind, I hid myself in the school one evening, and I heard.  I am ashamed of it now, though
 I suppose I was only exercising a legal right.  I found from their
 manner.
 The more I reflect, the more ENTIRELY I am on their side!"

" But to do, there'd be a general domestic
 disintegration. 
---
" Yes-- I am all abroad, I suppose!" said Phillotson sadly. 
---
I was
 never a very bright reasoner
---
And yet, I do n't see
.
---
I have out- Sued Sue in this-- all in the
 last twelve hours
---
" I do n't say. 
---
I do n't know--
---
I do n't know!... 
---
As I
 say
---
, I am only a feeler, not a reasoner."


---
He went under the stairs, and. 
---
" I think rafted, and not yourself," he continued. 
---
Gillingham accompanied his friend a mile on his way, and
---
which his friend answered" Aye, aye
---
when Phillotson was alone under the clouds of night, and
---
But,
 he said,"!"


---
" I think and
---
what I think!
---
as he walked back alone
---
I absolutely and unconditionally
 agree.
---
Having once come to this conclusion it seemed to Phillotson more
 and more indubitably the true one. 
---
that he was doing his duty by a woman who was at his mercy almost

---
His mild serenity at the sense
 overpowered his grief at relinquishing her.


---
How permanently it was imprinted upon his
 vision
---
,
 might have been interpreted by a stranger as displeasure that
 Phillotson intruded his presence on her for the few brief minutes
 that remained.


---
he helped her to; and
---
they discussed trivial questions of housekeeping, such as where he would find the
 key of this or that cupboard,.


---
" I am a bachelor by nature,, Sue. 
---
," he said, in a heroic
 attempt to put her at her ease
---
as it might be to other men who have

---
I have, too, this grand hobby in my head of
 writing' The Roman Antiquities of Wessex,' which will occupy all my
 spare hours."


---
",
, I will do it with so much pleasure!"
---
Phillotson mused, and. 
---
Jude will let me have--"


---
Phillotson saw
. 
---
as he wished her good- bye,
---
in which they
 parted the omnibus- man
---
When Phillotson got back into the house he went upstairs and opened
 the window in the direction the omnibus had taken. 
---
He came down then,
---
his face compressed like
 that of one bearing pain
---
; he put on his hat and. 
---
Suddenly turning round he came
 home.


---
He had no sooner entered than the voice of his friend Gillingham
.


---
she--"  Phillotson's throat got choked up, and
---
he could not go on.

---
He turned and.


---
he asked presently in a renewed
 voice.


---
There was a stability, a ballast, in Phillotson's pronouncement. 
---
which
 restrained his friend's comment
---
he asked.


---
I have some
 articles to arrange and clear away. 
---
," he continued. 
---
when I made
 up my mind to her going to live in her own way
---
" But I did make up my
 mind."


---
" Some men would have stopped at an agreement to separate."


---
" I've gone into all that, and. 
---
I was, and

---
the most old- fashioned man in the world on the question of
 marriage-- in fact I had never thought critically about its ethics
 at all. 
---
I could n't go
 against them."


---
When it was done Phillotson

---
" There," he said. 
---
as I told you
---
I am leaving to- morrow evening.
   
---
Richard and I thought. 
---
I feel rather frightened, and
   
---
I arrive at a little to seven. 
---
I
    know you will, of course, dear Jude; but
---
I feel so timid
    that I ca n't help begging you to be punctual. 
---
He has
    been so VERY kind to me through it all!

   
---
He entered the compartment
 promptly. 
---
He had a black bag in his hand, and.

---
he wore on Sundays and in the evening after work
---
Altogether he looked a very handsome young fellow, his ardent
 affection for her burning in his eyes.


---
" I-- I
 am so glad! 
---
I get out here?
---
" No. I get in, dear one! 
---
I've packed. 
---
Besides this bag I've only a
 big box which is labelled."


---
" But do n't I get out? 
---
I, at any
 rate, am. 
---
I've booked for Aldbrickham; and
---
" I thought
---
Strictly, I might have been made. 
---
But I
 pleaded urgency
---
and I was let off. 
---
I would have deserted any day at
 your command, dear Sue. 
---
I have deserted more than that for you!"


---
" I fear. 
---
I am doing you a lot of harm
---
" Oh I seem so bad--!"
---
that had begun in his
---
" He has been so good in letting me go,
---
He's not an unworthy fellow
---
," said Jude, glancing at the note.

---
" And I am ashamed of myself for hating him because he married you."

"
---
I suppose
---
I ought
---
because he has let
---
me love him, or
 repent
---
as if he had been less kind
---
you
 had run away against his will
---
Jude's eyes rested musingly on her face. 
---
Then he suddenly kissed
 her; and
---
," he answered; but. 
---
," Jude continued after a silence. 
---
" I have agreed. 
---
I thought at first, and
---
I could n't do it without getting
 her into trouble about that second marriage
---
I do n't want to
. 
---
I find. 
---
I have

---
" Yes, I shall be free."


---
In the pause, Jude's eyes fixed themselves with
 a stultified expression on the opposite seat. 
---
I thought of that, and I wired for a room for us at the
 Temperance Hotel there."

" I thought; and that I
 was deceiving you.  But I did n't mean that!"

" Well!" he
 said... 
---
He remained in silence; and!"


---
how discomfited he was
---
"," he said. 
---
" But-- I understood it like

---
I sha n't answer!"

---
On reflection his brow showed perplexity. 
---
because it is by his
 generosity
---
he had run after
 us with pistols
---
He repeated simply! 
---
Phillotson thought so
---
what he has written to me
---
He opened the letter she had
. 
---
" He's a good fellow
---
, is n't he!"
---
He was very resigned to letting me
 go-- too resigned almost
---
as when he made such thoughtful arrangements for my being comfortable
 on my journey, and
---
" he said pettishly. 
---
that, as woman
 with man, it was a risk to come
---
" Well-- don't be a greedy boy."


---
he saw himself as a possible second in such a torturing
 destiny.


---
he murmured. 
---
" Perhaps you are making
 a cat's paw of me with Phillotson all this time. 
---
He could never resist her.
---
since your marrying Phillotson because of a stupid
 scandal
---
him suffering
---
as I said
 before I did n't marry him altogether because of the scandal.
" You simply mean."


---
that you flirted outrageously with him, poor old
 chap, and then repented, and to make reparation,
---
He could see! 
---
, Jude
 inquired for another; and a youth who volunteered to find one wheeled
 their luggage to the George farther on, which proved to be the inn at
 which Jude had stayed with Arabella on that one occasion of their
 meeting after their division for years.


---
Owing, however, to, and to his
 preoccupation, he did not at first recognize the place. 
---
When Jude came back and
---
Jude looking round him
---
that you had met as estranged people, who were not husband
 and wife at all in Heaven's sight--
---
," he said sadly. 
---
" I ca n't explain, Sue."


---
And I shall never
 forget it, never!"


---
" I do n't see that. 
---
I have. 
---
After all, you were on good terms with your
 husband at that time."


---
" No, I was n't, Jude. 
---
that he was
 obliged
---
I see by your look it
! 
---
I wo n't have it for mine! 
---
I_ jumped out of the window!"


---
" I never knew such an unreasonable-- such a dog- in- the- manger
 feeling
---
," said Jude. 
---
" I am not, nor anybody else!"


---
I_ jumped out of the window!"


---
" I ca n't explain!"


---
that he did not understand her feelings very well
---
But
 he did a little; and.


---
" I-- I thought--!"
---
I did not, and
---
said Jude, as distressed as
 she.


---
" No-- I need not
---
Looking up from the quilt:", perhaps I would have gone on to the Temperance Hotel, after
 all,
---
; for I was beginning!"


---
I did belong to
 you
---
said Jude distantly.


---
" I thought, of course,
---
that a parting such as yours from her, and mine from him, ended
 the marriage
---
" I ca n't say more without speaking against her, and
---
I do n't want

---
to do that," said he. 
---
" Yet I must tell you one thing, which would
 settle the matter in any case. 
---
I knew nothing about it till after the visit we made
 here.
---
But I shall never inform against
 her! 
---
I shall not be likely to see her again
---
He laughed. 
---
" Never mind!" he said. 
---
" So that I am near you
---
, I am
 comparatively happy. 
---
when I put my arms
 round you
---
so that I almost expect!

---
" I know hardly any poetry
---
," he replied mournfully.


---
so I wo n't go on! 
---
" Now I forgive you! 
---
he
 did as commanded. 
---
he said with a sigh; and.

VI


 In returning to his native town of Shaston as schoolmaster Phillotson
 had won the interest and. 
---
who, though they did not honour him for his miscellaneous acquirements
,
---
as he would have been honoured elsewhere
---
When, shortly after his arrival, he brought home a pretty
 wife-- awkwardly pretty for him,
---
if he did not take care
---
Phillotson casually admitted to an acquaintance that he did not know
 where his wife was staying
---
The schoolmaster's growing languor
 and listlessness over his work gave countenance to the idea.


---
Though Phillotson had held his tongue as long as he could, except to
 his friend Gillingham, his honesty and directness
---
him
 to do so when misapprehensions as to Sue's conduct spread abroad
---
" Do n't," said Phillotson. 
---
But I gave my consent."


---
as if he had not apprehended the remark
---
What I say
---
"," Phillotson continued testily. 
---
that much seriousness marked the faces of
 the two men, and
---
that something
 new had happened about Mrs. Phillotson
---
Then Phillotson's little
 maidservant,, said
. 
---
that Mr. Phillotson had helped in his wife's packing,
---
till a request came to Phillotson
---
Gillingham
 was sitting in his house.


---
" observed Phillotson,
---
But I
 sha n't resign!"


---
" I think."


---
I would
---
" I wo n't.
---
To this good advice, however, Phillotson would not listen.


---
I do n't care
---
"," he said. 
---
" I do n't go. 
---
unless I am turned out
---
And
 for this reason; that by resigning I acknowledge; when I am more and more convinced every day that in the sight
 of Heaven and by all natural, straightforward humanity, I have acted
 rightly."


---
I have acted wrongly
 by her
---
that his rather headstrong friend would not be able to
 maintain such a position as this
---
he said nothing further, and

---
that he should not
 accept dismissal
---
which he attended
---
although he looked so weak and ill that his friend implored him to
 stay at home
---
When he stood up. 
---
he advanced them firmly,, and
---
as he had
 done to his friend
---
as it touched the morals of those he
 taught
---
Phillotson replied.


---
that he did not see
---
All the respectable inhabitants and well- to- do fellow- natives of
 the town were against Phillotson to a man. 
---
But, somewhat to his
 surprise, some dozen or more champions rose up in his defence as from
 the ground.


---
Although Phillotson had never spoken to one of these
 gentlemen
---
they now nobly led the forlorn hope in his defence.

---
a churchwarden was dealt such a topper with the map of Palestine
 that his head went right through Samaria, and
---
who took the side of Phillotson's party
---
When
 Phillotson saw
---
he deplored
 almost in groans the untoward and degrading circumstances.


---
that he had not resigned, and
---
that
 next morning he could not leave his bed
---
The farcical yet melancholy event was the beginning of a serious
 illness for him; and
---
he lay in his lonely bed in the pathetic state
 of mind of a middle- aged man who perceives at length that his
 life, intellectual and domestic, is tending to failure and gloom.

---
said Phillotson. 
---
" At Melchester-- I suppose;."


---
at least he was living there some time
 ago
---
he sat and, and
---
Arriving at that place it was forwarded to
 Marygreen in North Wessex, and thence to Aldbrickham by the only
 person who knew his present address-- the widow who had nursed his
 aunt.


---
Three days later, in the evening, making the Shaston
 windows like tongues of fire to the eyes of the rustics in that vale,
 the sick man fancied. 
---
that he heard, and
---
Phillotson
 did not speak
---
He turned his eyes upon her, and.


---
" I have no business here
---
that
 you recognize other feelings between man and woman than physical
 love
---
what troubles
 had resulted to him from letting her go
---
when his tea was
 brought up
---
he told the amazed little servant. 
---
till the beams were reflected into Phillotson's
 face
---
Phillotson smiled sadly. 
---
he murmured. 
---
as
 the sun glowed in his eyes
---
as Jude does n't know
---
to catch
 the omnibus for the train; he was
 out
---
," said Phillotson huskily. 
---
I do n't hate you!"


---
it to flit through his
---
when he
 said," Sue
---
He had noticed.


---
that, in turning away from him, tears
 were on her face and a quiver in her lip
---
to recall her-- he knew it.

---
while he pursued it
---
But he could not help it. 
---
," he murmured,
---
I'll
 forgive you and!"


---
" HE is your husband now, in effect, you mean, of course?"


---
He is obtaining a divorce from his wife
 Arabella.
---
that he has a wife
---
He is not doing it so much on his own account as on
 hers. 
---
And Jude has agreed.
---
There had arisen in Sue's face that incipient fright which showed
 itself whenever he changed from friend to husband, and. 
---
" to heel!" said Phillotson; but
---
even him know

---
The dread of a
 reactionary change in the schoolmaster's sentiments, coupled,
 perhaps, with a faint shamefacedness at letting what a slipshod lack of thoroughness, from a man's point of view,
 characterized her transferred allegiance,
---
Phillotson lay
.


---
as he pictured the prettily
---
who bore his name
---
Gillingham was so interested in Phillotson's affairs, and so
 seriously concerned about him, that he walked up the hill- side to
 Shaston two or three times a week, although, there and back, it was
 a journey of nine miles, which had to be performed between tea and
 supper, after a hard day's work in school. 
---
When he called on the
 next occasion
---
after Sue's visit his friend was downstairs, and

---
that his restless mood had been supplanted by a
 more fixed and composed one
---
," said Phillotson.


---
I mean
---
And I have
 been thinking
---
I believe. 
---
though I did not see it at the moment
---
I know--
---
I feel
 absolutely certain--. 
---
what I have begun
---
I have hopelessly
 ruined my prospects because of my decision as to what was best for
 us,
---
; I see only dire poverty ahead from
 my feet to the grave
---
; for I can be accepted as teacher no more. 
---
I
 shall probably have enough to do,; and
---
I shall be
 better able to bear it alone. 
---
I may as well tell you.
---
is some news she brought me-- the news
 that Fawley is doing the same
---
" Oh-- he had a spouse, too? 
---
" Well-- I do n't want your opinion on that. 
---
I was going
---
" I may disagree with your
 motive
---
," he said gently,.

---
for he respected views he could not share
---
" But I think--.
---
I doubt, however, if you can."






---
I


 will most quickly appear by
 and.


---
that he had taken at fifteen pounds a year,
 with three- pounds- ten extra for rates and taxes, and
---
which had cost him about
 their full value
---
As he entered the room this morning
---
he said after kissing her.


---
" Ah," said Jude,.


---
as he sat down
---
The same concluding incident in Jude's suit against Arabella had
 occurred about a month or two earlier. 
---
He looked at
 his sweetheart curiously.


---
, I believe,
---
" But I wonder--
---
I know. 
---
But I have an uncomfortable feeling that my freedom has
 been obtained under false pretences!"


---
to blame," he said mischievously.


---
as I am
---
" Very well, darling: so I will. 
---
I was afraid her criminal second marriage would have
 been discovered, and
---
Jude agreed, and
---
which
 Jude put on a lighter tie
---
," he said," like any other engaged
 couple. 
---
" Yes; I suppose
---
"," said he, with some gloom;". 
---
I think
---
I should begin,
---
I was licensed--
---
Although,, I
 trust you more than any other man in the world."


---
I should change
---
he expostulated;
---
" Apart from ourselves, and our unhappy peculiarities, it is foreign
 to a man's nature. 
---
when he is told
---
that
 he must and
---
There would be a much
 likelier chance of his doing it. 
---
if he were told
---
No doubt my father and
 mother, and your father and mother, saw it,. 
---
And I am not so exceptional a woman.

---
Jude fell back upon his old complaint-- that, intimate as they were,
 he had never once had from her an honest, candid declaration that she
 loved or could love him. 
---
" I really fear sometimes with a dubiousness approaching anger. 
---
,"
 he said,
---
I know. 
---
that they
 must never admit the full truth to a man
---
he has had

---

The better class of man,

: he had latterly occupied himself on his own account
 in working and lettering headstones, which he kept in a little yard
 at the back of his little house, where in the intervals of domestic
 duties she marked out the letters full size for him, and blacked them
 in after he had cut them. 
---
his only
 patrons were the poor people who lived in his own neighbourhood,
 and knew what a cheap man this" Jude Fawley: Monumental Mason"
( as he called himself on his front door) was to employ for the
 simple memorials they required for their dead. 
---
But he seemed more
 independent than before, and
---
it was the only arrangement under which
 Sue, who particularly wished to be no burden on him,.




---
Jude had just returned
 home from hearing a lecture on ancient history in the public hall not
 far off. 
---
When he entered
---
, Sue, who had been keeping indoors during
 his absence,. 
---
Jude had taken up some illustrated paper, which he perused
 till,
---
raising his eyes, he saw.


---
", Sue?" he said.


---
" I have a message for you
---
when
 Jude had finished his

he prepared. 
---
He had

"," said Jude.

---
He accordingly went into his bedroom and. 
---
he asked.


---
" Is that Mr. Fawley?
---
Jude replied.


---
" Yes, dear," said Jude. 
---
he inquired.


---
" I beg your pardon, Jude, for disturbing you
---
" he said.


---
No, Jude, I am not
---
And I am in great difficulty. 
---
I hope. 
---
I really
 am in great distress because of a sudden responsibility that's been
 sprung upon me from Australia; or I would n't trouble you--
---
I would n't.
---
I want."


---
he asked, in a
 distinctly softened tone.


---
" I have enough to pay for the night's lodging I have obtained, but
 barely enough to take me back again."


---
" said Jude in much perplexity. 
---
" I know,! 
---
-- I can see it in her shape, and!


---
" But I shall go
---
," said Jude. 
---
I love her little enough now
---
I do n't want." 
---
He turned to the stairs.


---
" And I--"

" And," said Jude.


---
come to that," he said,. 
---
" I've wanted, and
---
I've waited with
 the patience of Job, and
---
I do n't see. 
---
that I've got anything by my
 self- denial
---
I shall certainly give her something, and
---
hear what it
 is; no man could do less!"


---
There was that in his manner. 
---
him go downstairs
---
If he did not return in fourteen minutes

---
he would have lingered. 
---
He MIGHT enter the inn with Arabella,
---
him to drink with
 her
---
what disasters would befall him then
---
Jude appeared.


---
," he said,
---
just what I hold
---
" Perhaps I am coarse too, worse luck! 
---
I have the germs of every
 human infirmity in me
---
, I verily believe. 
---
why I saw
---
I have cured
 myself of drunkenness; but
---
I think
---
I never know in what new form a
 suppressed vice will break out in me! 
---
I do love you, Sue,! 
---
though I
 have danced attendance on you so long for such poor returns
---
what
 I should never have capable of, or any man, a year
 or two ago
---
But I should just like a few
 virtuous people who have condemned me in the past, about Arabella
 and other things, to have been in my tantalizing position with
 you through these late weeks!--they'd believe
---
, I think,."


---
that I
 have exercised some little restraint in always giving in to your
 wishes-- living here in one house, and not a soul between us
---
; I know, my dear
 protector.
---
I must go out and!"


---
" I ca n't say any more!--Oh,
---
" said he,. 
---
" I do feel
.

---
He kissed her on one side, and on the other, and in the
 middle, and.




---
" Now, dear," said Jude gaily at breakfast;"
---
I mean, or
---
" I feel!"
---
I was wickedly selfish last night
---
as I did
---
I
 did n't care about her being in trouble, and
---
, I suppose! 
---
I wonder? 
---
I hope.
---
so that the request did not surprise him
---
," he added,"
---
" And when you come back," he added," I'll be ready to go about the
 banns.  You'll come with me?"


---
" No-- only nested," he assured her.


---
so that her predecessor in Jude's affections would recognize
 her
---
that Jude could behold her forerunner now, with the daylight
 full upon her
---
Fawley,?" said Arabella,
.


---
I do n't
---
even if he's not really yours
---
" He is mine,!"


---
" He was n't yesterday."


---
at the dirty toilet- cover, and at the
 detached tail of Arabella's hair hanging on the looking- glass, just
 as it had done in Jude's time; and. 
---
My man finds, and. 
---
he ca n't do without me after all
---
that he has made me
 all along
---
" He asks
 me. 
---
His little corner public in Lambeth would go to
 pieces without me
---
, he says. 
---
But he is n't going
---
when he has had a drop
---
He's waiting to, any day
---
Life with a man is more
 businesslike after it, and
---
he turns you out of doors
---
, you can get the
 law to protect you, which you ca n't otherwise, unless he half- runs
 you through with a knife, or cracks your noddle with a poker. 
---
if he bolts away from you
---
what a man med
---
And
 if he bolts away from you-- I say it friendly,-- you'll have the sticks
 o' furniture, and. 
---
, now he's willing,. 
---
that frightened
 him
---
as Jude is
---
Just as he used to
. 
---
he is asking me
---
" It was
 quite by my wish that he did n't the moment I was free."


---
Would he run up? 
---
He saw
.


---
" I really did want, as I told him.  I came about that more than anything else.
 as I am going Well, I'll write to him about it.  I did n't want, but I will."



" Oh Jude-- I've been talking to her
---
how hopelessly vulgar an institution legal
 marriage is-- a sort of trap to catch a man
---
who
 now has a right to his freedom
---
we were deceiving him
 before
---
Praxiteles chiselling away
 at his latest Venus
---
His hand was raised
---
He looked round.


---
He came back to her.


---
he asked.


---
that you could get
 the law of a man better
---
if he beat you-- and
---
The men and women
 of our family are very generous, but
---
Jude went up to Sue's room and. 
---
After glancing at the paper; but he
 was so absorbed in his letter.


---
that he did not turn awhile
---
He looked and. 
---
the marked advertisement was simply the announcement
 of a marriage at St. John's Church, Waterloo Road, under the names,
" CARTLETT-- DONN";
---
how
 he is getting on, perhaps
---
But Jude's attention was still absorbed. 
---
he said in a disturbed voice
---
What shall I say or?"


   
---
( I wo n't be so distant as to call you. 
---
what I write about more particular
   
---
when I
    came down to Aldbrickham
---
I could n't very well tell it to
    your lady friend, and. 
---
as I could have explained better
    than by letter
---
though I have
   
---
, there was a boy born of our
    marriage,. 
---
eight months after I left you,
---
when I was at
    Sydney,
---
As I had separated from you
---
before I
    thought, 
---
and I was over
    there, and
---
, I did not think it
    convenient to write about the birth. 
---
I was then looking
    out for a good situation,. 
---
he has been with them ever since
---
why I did
   
---
when I met you in Christminster, nor
---
He is now of an intelligent age, of
    course, and. 
---
I am settled comfortably here
---
, his
    parents being alive
---
I would have him with me here in
    a moment, but
---
he is not old enough to be of any use in
    the bar nor, and
---
naturally
    Cartlett might think him in the way. 
---
I must ask you.
   
---
when he arrives,
---
for I do n't know
---
He is lawfully yours,. 
---
that I solemnly swear
---
he is n't
---
Whatever I may have done before or afterwards
---
, I was
    honest to you from the time we were married till I went
    away, and
---
I remain, yours,& c.,

    ARABELLA CARTLETT.



---
Jude did not reply, and
---
said he in an under- voice.
---
I ca n't make it out. 
---
if his birth was exactly when

---
Certainly, he's mine. 
---
I can not think!... 
---
when
 I met her at Christminster, and
---
Ah-- I do remember now."


---
Jude had by this time come to himself. 
---
What a view of life he
 must have, mine or not mine!
---
"" he said. 
---
" I must say. 
---
if I were
 better off
---
that,, I should not stop for a moment to think whose he might
 be
---
I would take him and. 
---
And we'll have him here! 
---
if he is n't yours it

---
I do hope he isn't--
---
though perhaps I ought
! 
---
If he is n't
---
, I should like so much!"


---
" Well, you must assume about him, my
 curious little comrade!"
---
he said. 
---
" I feel that, anyhow, I do n't like
 to leave the unfortunate little fellow to neglect. 
---
who does n't want him
---
who does n't know him
---
what the boy-- MY boy, perhaps, will find himself

---
" As I was the petitioner, I am really entitled to his custody, I
 suppose."

" Whether or no, we must have him. 
---
when he'll arrive
---
I see that.  I'll do the best I
 can to be a mother to him, and I'll work harder.  I wonder?" In the course of a few weeks, I suppose." I wish--" Whenever you have it, I think I shall. " Before the boy comes?"

" Certainly."


---
" It would make a more natural home for him, perhaps
---
Jude thereupon wrote in purely formal terms
---
that the boy
 should be sent on to them as soon as he arrived,
---
whether, had he known all this
---
, his conduct towards her would have

---
He had large,
 frightened eyes, and wore a white woollen cravat, over which a
 key was suspended round his neck by a piece of common string: the
 key attracting attention by its occasional shine in the lamplight.

---
In the band of his hat his half- ticket was stuck. 
---
His eyes
 remained mostly fixed on the back of the seat opposite, and
---
who, regarding the kitten with his saucer eyes, seemed

---
The boy would say,".


---
He was
---
that
 his real self showed through crevices
---
when his face took a back view over some great Atlantic
 of Time, and
---
-- even the kitten curling itself up in the basket, weary of its
 too circumscribed play-- the boy remained just as before. 
---
He then
 seemed.


---
as if he saw their whole
 rounded lives rather than their immediate figures
---
This was Arabella's boy. 
---
in whose charge he had come
---
the family,
 having put him into a cab for Lambeth and.


---
the boy was deposited on the
 lonely platform beside his box. 
---
The collector took his ticket, and,
.


---
where
 he was going by himself at that time of night
---
further the boy came out into the street, round
---
When he
 had walked some little distance he asked for the street of his
 destination. 
---
He was told.


---
He followed his directions literally, without an
 inquiring gaze at anything. 
---
that the boy's
 ideas of life were different from those of the local boys
---
The boy seemed
. 
---
He found the way to the little lane, and. 
---
Jude had just retired to bed, and
---
" Is this where Father lives?.


---
" Mr. Fawley, that's his name."


---
he hurried down as soon
 as he could, though to her impatience
---
he seemed long.


---
" What-- is it he-- so soon?"
---
as Jude came
---
Jude lifted the boy to a level with
 himself,. 
---
he would have been met,
---
if they had known of his coming so soon
---
whilst he went,
---
as he knew
---
He found her in the
 dark,. 
---
He enclosed her with his arm, and
?"


---
" But the other half of him is-- SHE! 
---
The boy looked at her.

---
" he inquired.


---
" Well, yes;' cept he seems fond of you, and you of him. 
---
he began. 
---
where he soon fell asleep
---
as he lay
---
" He called you Mother two or three times,"
. 
---
before he dropped off
---
that he should have wanted to
---
his quaint and
 weird face set, and
---
his eyes resting on things they did not see in
 the substantial world
---
His face is like the tragic mask of Melpomene
---
that these preternaturally old boys almost always come from new
 countries
---
said his father with some
 disappointment.


---
The boy shook his head. 
---
him christened
---
"," said Jude; and privately to Sue
---
Yet the advent of the child disturbed him.


---
Jude Fawley signed the form of notice,. 
---
never before seen by her, into which
 her own and Jude's names were inserted, and by which that very
 volatile essence
---
' For what man is he that hath
---
him go and
---
Let return unto his house, lest he
 die in the battle, and
---
another man take her.' 
---
that people thought him hers, and
---
Meanwhile Jude decided. 
---
who was associated with his early life at Marygreen-- the aged
 widow Mrs. Edlin, who had been his great- aunt's friend and nurse in
 her last illness
---
He hardly expected; but
---
as he never spoke
---
though,, they were
 hardly conscious of him
---
how he that the tale is told of
---
if he WERE one of your family
---
said Jude.


---
I know
---
What-- did this man-- my ancestor
 and Sue's-- kill his wife?"


---
He wanted
 the body, to bury it where his people lay, but
---
Her husband then came in the night with a cart, and; but
---
he was catched, and. 
---
what he broke in for
---
he was hanged and
---
after he was dead
---
that he belonged to ye more than to me
---
for they had forgotten him
---
I am
 going I vowed in to my other husband,
 and you to me in the same" If you are uneasy I am made unhappy," said he. 
---
" I had hoped you
. 
---
the twain and their friends
 straggled out, one of the witnesses saying casually to Jude and Sue
 in passing, as if he had known them before:" See the couple just
 come in? 
---
her mouth shaping itself like that of
 a child about to give way to grief:

" Jude-- I do n't like it here
---
I wish! 
---
I wish. 
---
" Dear little girl," said Jude. 
---
", I suppose?
---
He spoke to the clerk, and. 
---
," he said. 
---
We can be married in
 a church, if not with the same certificate with another he'll give
 us
---
", I think. 
---
I
 too, and talk it over."


---
" But Jude, dearest, I am worrying you! 
---
when I got inside
---
" Well, to tell the truth, I felt as if I did n't
 care much about it. 
---
And then I thought of what you had said this
 morning as to whether we ought.
---
a man was her only chance of
 salvation... 
---
Jude went up and. 
---
," he said. 
---
And Jude said.


---
he also thought--
---
His betrothed shuddered; and? 
---
if he indeed
 felt
---
"," said Jude. 
---
I'll
 do it
---
he went on to
 confess that, though he thought they ought to be able to do it, he
 felt checked by the dread of incompetency just as she did-- from their
 peculiarities, perhaps, because they were unlike other people. 
---
what's the matter with us" he declared.


---
I fancy more
---
" Well, I do n't know. 
---
though I have felt it myself
 about my fellow- creatures, at morbid times."


---
He gave her a little kiss behind a pillar; and
---
the new husband and wife came into the open
 daylight. 
---
" Still, Sue, it is no worse for the woman than for the man. 
---
" Yes-- some are like that, instead of uniting with the man against
 the common enemy, coercion." 
---
when he comes in
---
" He'll think, and
---
that he
 should not be surprised and puzzled
---
The purpose of a chronicler of moods and deeds does not require him
.

---
when the unexpected apparition of Jude's child
 in the house had shown itself
---
as he seemed at present
---
probably not a single
 inhabitant of Stoke- Barehills is now even aware that the two roads
 which part in his town ever meet again;.


---
: the other by a
 cross- line from Aldbrickham; and from the London train alights a
 couple; a short, rather bloated man, with a globular stomach and
 small legs, resembling a top on two pegs, covered with beads from bonnet to skirt, that made her glisten
.


---
The man was about to hire a fly as some
 others had done,. 
---
" You ca n't carry home furniture by excursion train in a thick
 voice, her husband, the landlord of The Three Horns, Lambeth
---
that he, too, like his
 customers, was becoming affected by the liquors he retailed
---
Do n't you recognize the man?
---
" No."

" Not from the photos I have showed you?"

" Is it Fawley?"


---
he was
---
Cartlett's interest in Jude been,,
---
Mr.
 Cartlett had no other idea than that his wife's child by her first
 husband was with his grandparents at the Antipodes.


---
him kindle and
---
though he was to
 some extent a hindrance to the delightfully unreserved intercourse
 in their pilgrimages which they so much enjoyed
---
Jude, in his
 light grey holiday- suit, was really proud of her companionship, not
 more for her external attractiveness than for her sympathetic words
 and ways. 
---
a passing sadness would touch their
 faces at their every failure to disturb his indifference
---
he did marry her
---
he was going to
---
He's charmed by her!
---
how he looks round at her
---
his eyes rest on her
---
he could make. 
---
if he liked to

---
which he's too simple to do
---
I am
 inclined to think that she do n't care for him quite so much as he
 does for her. " I do n't want.  so can I."

 Cartlett was not loath to agree to this, and
---
they parted-- he
 and Arabella in the direction taken by Jude and Sue. 
---
"

" Have you met Jude and his young woman, or wife, or
---
" Oh, that's his present young woman-- wife
---
Has he
 married again?
---
" He's a nice- looking chap, too! 
---
he's not

---
The physician had produced a box from his waistcoat pocket, and

---
" At the same time," continued he,,
---
" Ah-- you lost him, then? 
---
And believe me, he soon
 knew nearly as much as I."

"
---
There he is,;."


---
So her husband thought, no doubt,... 
---
when he divorced
 her
---
Jude and Sue, with
 the child, unaware of the interest, had gone
 up to a model at one end of the building, which they regarded
 with considerable attention for a long while before they went
 on. 
---
the
 inscription was:" Model of Cardinal College, Christminster;
 by J. Fawley and S. F. M. Bridehead."


---
that Jude's hand sought Sue's, the two standing close
 together so as to conceal,
---
Anny meanwhile had jokingly remarked to Vilbert on Arabella's
 hankering interest in her first husband.


---
He
 produced a small phial of clear liquid. 
---
You use the liquid by contriving that the desired man shall take
 about ten drops of it in his drink. 
---
him seated on
 a stool by the bar,
---
as other men
 do their wives
---
And they left the tent together,
 this pot- bellied man and florid woman, in the antipathetic,
 recriminatory mood of the average husband and wife of Christendom.


---
for the gay sights, the air, the
 music, and the excitement of a day's outing with Jude had quickened
 her blood and. 
---
" I should like!"" Yes, you baby," said he: and
---
it was my
 husband's fault
---
I shall say!"

" Happy?" he murmured.


---
Jude was quite content with a baffle from his ever evasive companion.

---
when he had forgotten, and
---
that he had put the question
---
because
 he no longer wished for an answer
---
He knew. 
---
" I am very, very sorry,
 Father and Mother," he said. 
---
I should like the flowers very very much,!"




---
if I did n't keep on

---
The society of Spring Street and the
 neighbourhood generally did not understand, and Sue and Jude's private minds, emotions,
 positions, and fears. 
---
who called Jude" Father
---
Little Time-- for though he was formally turned into" Jude," the apt
 nickname stuck to him--; and.


---
that had been made to him by the
 other boys
---
when he heard them
---
two or three months
 later,, Jude perceived, a course all the more unfortunate just now,
.


---
that he would have
---
in that he had not as yet cleared off the debt
---
he had unavoidably

---
One evening he sat down. 
---
I am thinking
---
"," he said to her,". 
---
that I'll hold on
 here no longer
---
And so I am afraid we must break it up
 here, however awkward for you, poor dear!"


---
" Well-- I am not sorry
---
But,
, you wo n't take him away from me,
---
him go now
---
The cloud upon his young mind makes him so
 pathetic to me
---
And he loves me so.

---
You wo n't take him away from me?
---
"

" Do n't hurry about getting employment," he said regretfully. 
---
" I
 do n't want. 
---
I wish Sue. 
---
The boy and
 yourself are enough for you to attend to.
---
Jude answered it. 
---
Jude reflected, and.


---
he could undertake it
---
he has refused."


---
" Excellent old man!" said Sue to herself,.


---
since
 he wo n't have
---
Jude came indoors. 
---
" There," he said cheerfully. 
---
Next day Jude went out to the church, which was only two miles
 off. 
---
He found.

---
, he began. 
---
erected by Jude, which she was
 nevertheless timid at mounting
---
while he set about
---
where he might find her
 between school- hours,
---
if he wished
---
He described
---
how some boys had taunted him about his nominal mother,
 and Sue
---
men from Aldbrickham to do'em
---
the men had. 
---
neither among pa'sons, clerks, nor
 people, and to keep the men up to their work the vicar had. 
---
as I say whether Jude and
 Sue had left the" nots" out likewise
---
remained without
 speaking; till, looking at her narrowly, he found.


---
" Never mind, comrade!" he said. 
---
" I know!"


---
" I ca n't BEAR! 
---
I am afraid I have done you mischief,

---
"," said Jude gaily. 
---
" I do n't care
---
," said Jude. 
---
" I sha n't
 take any more trouble."


---
having eaten it, were about to set to work anew when
 a man entered the church, and Jude recognized in him the contractor
 Willis. 
---
He beckoned to Jude, and.


---
," he said,
---
" I do n't wish---- but
---
as of
 course I did n't know
---
I am afraid I must ask
 you and her to leave off, and let somebody else finish this! 
---
I'll pay you for the week, all
 the same."


---
Jude was too independent; and
---
the contractor paid
 him, and. 
---
Jude picked up his tools, and
---
Jude returned. 
---
the boy pursued their thoughtful way
 to Aldbrickham
---
Fawley had still a pretty zeal in the cause of education, and,
---
as was
 natural with his experiences, he was active in furthering" equality
 of opportunity" by any humble means open to him. 
---
He had joined an
 Artizans' Mutual Improvement Society established in the town about
 the time of his arrival there;
---
its members being young men of all
 creeds and denominations, including Churchmen, Congregationalists,
 Baptists, Unitarians, Positivists, and others
---
Jude's activity, uncustomary
 acquirements, and, above all, singular intuition on what to read
 and how to set about it-- begotten of his years of struggle against
 malignant stars-- had led to his being placed on the committee.


---
before he had obtained any more work to do
---
, he went. 
---
when he arrived
---
as he entered
---
they looked dubiously at him,
 and. 
---
He guessed. 
---
that something
 bearing on himself had been either discussed or
---
Nothing further was said in Jude's presence, but
---
he knew; and.


---
turning to the table wrote a note resigning his office
 there and then
---
what
 could Jude do with his great- aunt's heavy old furniture
---
if he left
 the town to travel
---
he knew not whither? 
---
This, and the necessity of
 ready money, compelled him.


---
much as he would
 have preferred
---
for he was compelled
---
Here Jude discovered her; and
---
with eyes on each other they heard these
 passing remarks-- the quaint and mysterious personality of Father
. 
---
"," he sighed heavily. 
---
" But in the country I shall always be uneasy.  And I do n't care.  To cut him
 off from his past I have determined.  I am sickened
 of ecclesiastical work now; and I should n't like!"

" You ought. 
---
Unless he keeps a cake and gingerbread stall at markets and fairs,

---
:" Now
 this antique oak settle-- a unique example of old English furniture,
 worthy the attention of all collectors!"

"," said Jude. 
---
" I wish!"


---
Jude
 and the other two were getting tired and hungry, but
---
Jude kissed her, and. 
---
He would go on with the
 boy, and.


---
Jude did not come
 back.

 it comfortable for her

---
From that week Jude Fawley and Sue walked no more in the town of
 Aldbrickham.


---
that
 they had taken advantage of his adaptive craftsmanship
---
Wherever Jude heard of free- stone work
---
to be done, thither he went,
.

---
He laboured at a job, long or briefly,; and

---
he might have

---
Later still he was at
 Kennetbridge, a thriving town not more than a dozen miles south of
 Marygreen,
---
this being his nearest approach to the village where he
 was known
---
; for he had a sensitive dread of being questioned as to his
 life and fortunes by those who had been acquainted with him during
 his ardent young manhood of study and promise, and his brief and
 unhappy married life at that time.


---
At some of these places he would be detained for months, at others
 only a few weeks. 
---
which had risen in him
---
His curious and sudden antipathy to ecclesiastical
 work, both episcopal and noncomformist, when
 suffering under a smarting sense of misconception, remained with him
 in cold blood, less from any fear of renewed censure than from an
 ultra- conscientiousness which would not allow him to seek a living
 out of those who would disapprove of his ways; also, too, from a
 sense of inconsistency between his former dogmas and his present
 practice, hardly a shred of the beliefs with which he had first
 gone up to Christminster now remaining with him. 
---
He was
---
when he first met
 her
---
" I will just find out Anny
---
," said the widow- lady to her
 companion, when the horse and cart had been taken by a man who came
 forward:"
---
" How do you do, Mrs.
 Fawley?
---
He died suddenly, six weeks ago,. 
---
though he was a kind husband to me
---
When he was gone
---
He'll never be a beauty,
---
Does he know?
---
He thinks
---
there is some mystery about his parentage
---
Jude is going."


---
when he is a little older
---
I am a friend." Juey," said Sue suddenly," go down to the station platform with this
 tray-- there's another train coming in, I think. I am his mother really" But how do you come? 
---
" Then you are living with him still?"


---
Jude used."


---
" Perhaps my husband has altered a little since then. 
---
because he caught a chill early in the year, the work having to be executed by a fixed day
---
he had
---
He is better
; but
---
than he was
---
I am sure he
 is not proud now!" " I am doing this
. " Well, I am respectable too,. " That's a pure accident. 
---
He was brought up to the baking business,
 and
---
it occurred to him. 
---
which he can make
 without coming out of doors
---
It was a whim of his
."


---
What a queer fellow
 he is, and
---
he is
---
" I never saw any like'em.  Come now though you are so fond of
 him!"


---
" Of course Christminster is a sort of fixed vision with him, which
 I suppose he'll never be cured of believing in. 
---
He still thinks it
 a great centre of high and fearless thought, instead of what it is,
 a nest of commonplace schoolmasters whose characteristic is timid
 obsequiousness to tradition."


---
till his
 illness came
---
" Here comes the boy back again
---
He's in very good hands,; and
---
" I
 came here to- day Anny, I've heard of un again, and I've seen
 HER!"

" I've heard of Jude, and I've seen his wife.  what
 I will though I sung the hymns wi' all my strength, I have not
 been able to help thinking about' n; which I've no right to do as a
 chapel member."

" Ca n't ye fix your mind upon what was said by the London preacher
 to- day, and?"


---
" You could take a lock of your late- lost husband's hair, and."


---
I had my struggles" What shall I do about it?"" I have n't a morsel!--and if I had After all
 that's said about the comforts of this religion, I wish I had Jude
 back again!"

" You must fight valiant against the feeling,.

since he's another's

And I've heard."

 I know as well as you what I should do; only I do n't do it!"

" He's more mine than hers!"
---
" What right has she to

---
And your husband only six weeks gone! 
---
as it leads to where he is
---
" What right has she to
 him, I should like!  I'd take him from her if I could!"

 if I do I wo n't be a creeping
 hypocrite any longer-- so there!"

" I've tried that sort o' physic I must be as I was born!"

 You'll be all right again soon."


---
In his hand he carried a basket; and
---
there was
 a touch of slovenliness in his attire, together with that indefinable
 something in his whole appearance which suggested one who was his
 own housekeeper, purveyor, confidant, and friend, through possessing
 nobody else at all in the world to act in those capacities for him.

---
they offered him a lift, which he accepted.


---
" Yes; my name is
 Phillotson
---
If I do n't mistake I am talking to Mr. Phillotson," he said. 
---
" But I do n't recognize you, ma'am."


---
" I remember you well enough, and I one of your scholars. 
---
I used,. 
---
He shook his head. 
---
" No," he said politely,".

---
I do n't recall the name
---
And I should hardly recognize in your present portly self the slim
 school child

" Well, I always had plenty of flesh on my bones. 
---
I am

?"


---
who I married

 mistaken

" Dear me, dear me," said Phillotson,.

To be sure-- he had a wife!

---
till my husband died
 lately
---
" No," said Phillotson, with sudden testiness. 
---
I am convinced I did only what was right, and
 just, and moral. 
---
I have suffered for my act and opinions, but
---
I hold
 to them;!"


---
" I do n't care.

---
although I take fifty pounds a year here after taking
 above two hundred elsewhere
---
However,, I prefer it to running the risk of
 having my old domestic experiences raked up against me, as I should
 do if I tried to make a move.
---
" I met her by accident at Kennetbridge this very day, and
---
Her husband is ill, and she anxious.

I saw
 her just afterwards, and."


---
Phillotson grasped the edge of the spring- cart, and.

 go," he said.


---
However, I think

whatever
 he med

I should have kept her

what he says

"

" Not for the moment, ma'am, I regret.
---
I used, and
---
I was carrying on a bit. '
---
Then shall the man be
 guiltless; but
---
" Yes," said Phillotson, with biting sadness. 
---
" I can not answer you, madam. 
---
I have never known much of womankind."


---
to which Phillotson said
---
his
 errand led him
---
he alighted,.


---
How is he now
---
" upstairs again your husband will be well enough-- don't' ee trouble."


---
Here
 they greeted Jude, who was sitting in an arm- chair, the increased
 delicacy of his normally delicate features, and the childishly
 expectant look in his eyes, being alone sufficient to show that he
 had been passing through a severe illness.


---
he said, a gleam of interest lighting
 up his face.


---
Jude was discomposed. 
---
" he said.


---
Jude's countenance remained clouded. 
---
" Well," said Jude,
---
I feel much better to- day, and
---
Then Jude confessed. 
---
what was in his mind
---
He said. 
---
after his having resolutely avoided all the old places
 for so long
---
But one thing and another had made, and, if she did n't mind, he would like
 to go back there. 
---
him think a great
 deal of Christminster lately
---
if he could n't work
---
He had no sense
 of shame at mere poverty; and
---
perhaps he would be as strong as ever
 soon, and able to set up stone- cutting for himself there.


---
how it hates all men like me
---
that he was recovering
---
His hope proved
---
" Yes," said Jude quietly,, Sue attending to their own
 eldest. 
---
as he took charge of the small child, and

---
" I thought."


---
" But I am afraid it will depress you!"
---
Having left their luggage and his tools at the station on foot up the familiar street, the holiday people all drifting in
 the same direction. 
---
when, looking at
 the clock and the hurrying crowd, Jude said:"
---
But his soul seemed full of the anniversary, and
---
their smallest child in Jude's arms, Sue leading
 her little girl, and Arabella's boy walking thoughtfully and silently
 beside them
---
"," said Jude. 
---
, I should have gone to the dogs with despair!"


---
that he was getting into one of his
 tempestuous, self- harrowing moods
---
," said he.


---
till there arose on Jude's sight the circular theatre with
 that well- known lantern above it, which stood in his mind as the sad
 symbol of his abandoned hopes, for it was from that outlook that he
 had finally surveyed the City of Colleges on the afternoon of his
 great meditation, which convinced him at last of the futility of his
 attempt to be a son of the university
---
And pushing his way to the front he took up a
 position close to the barrier, still hugging the youngest child in
 his arms,.

---
he
 whispered.


---
"," said Jude, without turning his head.


---
he wondered
---
Jude,, explained it, and.


---
that
 the people all round him
---
which he had studied years
 before
---
for Jude was apt to get too enthusiastic over
 any subject in hand
---
; he used

---
Jude Fawley, that's his name! 
---
he used? 
---
Why, I know that man because he
 aimed at that line o' business
---
He's married
---
and
 that's his child he's carrying. 
---
, I suppose, then, Taylor would know him,."


---
as he knows
 everybody
---
The speaker was a man named Jack Stagg, with whom Jude had formerly
 worked in repairing the college masonries
---
Having his attention called the latter cried
 across the barriers to Jude:" You've honoured us by coming back
 again, my friend!"


---
Jude nodded.


---
Jude assented to this also.


---
Jude recognized its owner.


---
whom he had

---
Jude replied good- humouredly.


---
that he could not dispute it; and
---
during which Tinker Taylor asked Jude and the night of
 the challenge in the public house
---
if
 he remembered the Apostles' Creed in Latin still,
---
as he stood
---
But finding himself the centre of curiosity, quizzing, and comment,
 Jude was
---
what he
 had no great reason to be ashamed of
---
not inclined to shrink from open declarations of; and in a little while was
 stimulated to say in a loud voice to the listening throng generally:

" It is a difficult question, my friends, for any young man-- that
 question I had to grapple with, and which thousands are weighing
 at the present moment in these uprising times-- whether to follow
 uncritically the track he finds himself in, without considering his
 aptness for it, or to consider what his aptness or bent may be, and
 re- shape his course accordingly. 
---
how
 wise that young man was,
---
what a fool that
 fellow was in following a freak of his fancy
---
my impulses-- affections-- vices-- were too strong not to hamper a man without advantages;. 
---
who
 should be as cold- blooded as a fish and as selfish as a pig to have a
 really good chance of being one of his country's worthies
---
I tried You may
 ridicule me-- I am quite willing that you should-- I am a fit subject,
 no doubt.  But I think what I have gone through these
 last few years.  And"-- he
 nodded towards the college at which the dons were severally

---
" He do look ill and worn- out
---
though he had

---
Jude shifted the child into a more easy position on his arm, and
. 
---
And, a sick and poor man, is not the worst
 of me
---
: can only be discovered
 by men or women with greater insight than mine--. '
---
what is good for
 man in this life
---
who can tell a man?
---
what shall be after him
 under the sun
---
And privately to his
 neighbours:" Why, one of them jobbing pa'sons swarming about here,

---
And then he must have

---
"," said Jude," at college gates in the most
 religious and educational city in the world?
---
Jude was not
 one of these, and
---
though Jude did not notice it then
---
said he.


---
their red and black gowned forms passing across the field of
 Jude's vision like inaccessible planets across an object- glass
---
he seemed, and. 
---
Here
 they stood upon the straw that was laid to drown the discordant noise
 of wheels, where the quaint and frost- eaten stone busts encircling
 the building looked with pallid grimness on the proceedings, and in
 particular at the bedraggled Jude, Sue, and their children, as at
 ludicrous persons who had no business there.


---
" I wish!"
---
I could get in
---
he said to her fervidly. 
---
" Listen-- I may
 catch a few words of the Latin speech by staying here
---
However, beyond the peals of the organ, and the shouts and hurrahs
 between each piece of oratory, Jude's standing in the wet did not
 bring much Latin to his intelligence more than, now and then, a
 sonorous word in_ um_ or_ ibus_.


---
he sighed after a
 while. 
---
" Now I'll go, my patient Sue. 
---
I'll never care any
 more about the infernal cursed place, upon my soul
---
I wo n't! 
---
" I saw Richard amongst the people on the other side."


---
" He is evidently come up to Jerusalem: and
---
He had the same hankering for the university that you had, in
 a milder form. 
---
I do n't think,. 
---
he saw me
---
though he must have heard

---
But he seemed.
---
he did
---
Your mind is free from worries about him now,
 my Sue?"


---
" Yes, I suppose so. 
---
But I am weak. 
---
Although I know
---
, I felt a curious dread of him; an awe, or terror, of
 conventions
---
I do n't believe in. 
---
Oh-- I forgot,! 
---
which to Jude was
 irresistible
---
said Jude suddenly, instead of addressing her.


---
" I do n't know!
---
" No; for lodgings," said Jude,.


---
Jude looked discomfited, and
---
the boy distressed. 
---
The boy sighed. 
---
he said. 
---
" I am
 sorry to say we do n't let where there are children"; and" I do n't like
 Christminster!"" No; colleges," said Jude;" which perhaps you'll study in some day.
---
"

" I'd rather not!" the boy rejoined.


---
," said Jude.


---
if her husband could go
 elsewhere
---
till Jude had time to get a more
 permanent abode
---
Jude
 stayed and; and. 
---
he
 went.


---
When he was gone the landlady
---
that her husband
 and herself had each been unhappy in their first marriages, after
 which, terrified at the thought of a second irrevocable union, and
 lest the conditions of the contract should kill their love, yet
 wishing to be together
---
Her quiet was broken by
 the noise of someone entering the house, and then the voices of a
 man and woman in conversation in the passage below. 
---
The landlady's
 husband had arrived, and
---
His voice rose in sudden anger. 
---
Besides, did n't I say? 
---
I would n't have
 children
---
, the husband insisted on
 his point;
---
My husband objects; and
---
which had just been sent
 on from the station by Jude
---
while he was perhaps
---
?" said the boy with misgiving.


---
absence Jude had left his address; but
---
how weak he still was

---
that
 it should have led Jude, who loved her and the children so tenderly,
,
---
because he was still

---
haunted by his dream
---
Even now he did not distinctly hear.


---
that those scholared walls had echoed to his
 desire
---
The failure to find another lodging, and the lack of room in this
 house for his father, had made a deep impression on the boy-- a
 brooding undemonstrative horror seemed to have seized him. 
---
The
 silence was broken by his saying:" Mother, WHAT shall we do
 to- morrow!"


---
" I do n't know!
---
Father was quite well
---
there had been room for him!

---
" Father went away,
---
to give us children room did n't he?"


---
The boy jumped up wildly. 
---
The boy burst out. 
---
he
 cried in bitter reproach. 
---
" How EVER could you, Mother, be so wicked
 and cruel as this,, and Father well! 
---
Father a- forced, and;
 and
---
He walked up and down.


---
He got up, and. 
---
him say:"
---
Jude had
 informed her
---
he went out
---
He had been so anxious about her all night
---
, he
 said. 
---
Jude agreed with her, but.


---
," he said. 
---
In fact, I'll go with you."


---
Jude stood. 
---
so that his back was turned to the little inner
 chamber where the children lay
---
him to start round
---
He saw.

---
Hastening forward to pick her up he turned his eyes to the little
 bed spread on the boards
---
He looked in
 bewilderment round the room. 
---
An overturned chair was near
 the elder boy, and; but

---
his glazed eyes were slanted into the room
---
, he
 let,; but
---
He caught up Sue, who
 was in fainting fits, and put her on the bed in the other room, after
 which he breathlessly summoned the landlady and ran out for a Doctor.


---
When he got back
---
Jude had

---
as inferred, his presence was superfluous. 
---
that the elder boy, on waking, looked into
 the outer room for Sue, and,
---
that the events and information of the
 evening before had induced in his morbid temperament
---
Moreover a
 piece of paper was found upon the floor, on which was written, in
 the boy's hand, with the bit of lead pencil that he carried:


   
---
At sight of this Sue's nerves utterly gave way, an awful conviction
 that her discourse with the boy had been the main cause of the
 tragedy, throwing her into a convulsive agony which knew no
 abatement. 
---
" No," said Jude. 
---
" It was in his nature. 
---
there are such boys springing up amongst us-- boys of a sort unknown
 in the last generation-- the outcome of new views of life
---
He says. 
---
He's an advanced man, the Doctor: but

---
he can give no consolation to--"

 Jude had kept back his own grief on account of her; but
---
he now
 broke down; and
---
The boy's face expressed the whole tale of their situation. 
---
On
 that little shape had converged all the inauspiciousness and shadow
 which had darkened the first union of Jude, and all the accidents,
 mistakes, fears, errors of the last. 
---
He was their nodal point, their
 focus, their expression in a single term. 
---
he had groaned
---
For the rashness of those
 parents, for their ill assortment he had quaked, and
 for the misfortunes of these he had died.


---
"' We are made a
 spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men!'"


---
," he said. 
---
He tried."


---
which had been lying on a chair at the time
 of his death
---
though Jude would fain

---
whenever he touched them
---
Jude dreaded her dull apathetic silences almost more than her
 paroxysms. 
---
I ca n't BEAR the loneliness
 of being out of your looks!"

" There, dear; here I am," he said,.


---
" Ah; but it was I who incited him really, though I did n't know I was
 doing it! 
---
I talked to the child. 
---
he took it literally.

---
It upset him. 
---
I said; and And I told him I was going.  Oh
 how bitterly he upbraided me!"


---
" I ca n't tell.  that I wanted And yet I was n't
 truthful, for with a false delicacy I told him too obscurely.-- Why
 was I half- wiser than my fellow- women?  Why
 did n't I tell him pleasant untruths, instead of half- realities?  It
 was my want of self- control,!"


---
He must have
."


---
" And I was just making; and now I shall
 never see him in it, and!...  ago I called myself happy!  I said
 What dreadful things I
 said!  And now Fate has given us this stab in the back for being such
 fools as to take Nature at her word!"


---
" Yes," replied Jude. 
---
the boy wished, or
---
he
 would n't have done it. 
---
for him to die
---
: it
 was part of his incurably sad nature, poor little fellow! 
---
I am a pitiable
 creature
---
"," he replied. 
---
Jude got into the vehicle, and
---
it drove away, much to the
 relief of the landlord, who now had only Sue and her luggage
 remaining on his hands, which he hoped to be also clear of later on
 in the day, and so to have freed his house from the exasperating
 notoriety it had acquired during the week through his wife's unlucky
 admission of these strangers. 
---
In the afternoon he privately
 consulted with the owner of the house, and
---
When Jude had seen the two little boxes-- one containing little Jude,
 and the other the two smallest-- deposited in the earth he hastened
 back to Sue, who was still in her room, and
---
he therefore did not
 disturb her just then. 
---
Feeling anxious, however, he went again
 about four o'clock. 
---
where he was sleeping
---
he went along
 the road to the cemetery, which he entered, and crossed to where the
 interments had recently taken place
---
A man with a
 shovel in his hands was attempting to earth in the common grave of
 the three children, but
---
his arm was held back by an expostulating
 woman who stood in the half- filled hole. 
---
" He's filling them in, and
---
he sha n't!"
---
let," said the man with the spade. 
---
Do ye go home with
 your husband, and."


---
Ca n't I see them once more-- just
 once
---
Ca n't I? 
---
And I should be so glad, Jude! 
---
I will be so good, and

---
I would go
 home quietly afterwards, and! 
---
Ca n't I?

---
Why ca n't I?"


---
Jude was thrown into such acute sorrow that he
 almost felt he would try to get the man to accede. 
---
he saw. 
---
So he coaxed her, and

---
He wished, but
---
Jude saw
---
Jude waited all the evening downstairs. 
---
At a very late hour the
 intelligence was brought to him.




---
Jude had
 again obtained work at his old trade. 
---
those ideas were now exchanged for a sense of
 Jude and herself fleeing from a persecutor.


---
" All the ancient wrath of
 the Power above us has been vented upon us, His poor creatures, and

---
It is only against man and senseless circumstance
---
"," said Jude.


---
" What have I been thinking of! 
---
I am getting
 as superstitious as a savage!... 
---
I have no more fighting strength
 left; no more enterprise. 
---
I am beaten,... 
---
' We are made a
 spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men!' 
---
I am always

---
" I feel the same!"


---
" I hardly know. 
---
However, I think
."


---
And Jude fell into thought. 
---
" I have seemed to myself lately,"
. 
---
he said,"
---
to belong to that vast band of men-- the men called seducers
---
when I think of it
---
I have not been conscious of it, or of any wrongdoing towards you,
 whom I love more than myself. 
---
Yet I am one of those men! 
---
I wonder
?... 
---
what I am
---
I seduced you... 
---
But I could n't leave you alone!"


---
without me
 perhaps you would n't have urged him."


---
Jude looked at her with some surprise, and.


---
Jude had
---
quite
 unexpectedly found good employment at his old trade almost directly
 he arrived,
---
the summer weather suiting his fragile constitution; and

---
outwardly his days went on with that monotonous uniformity which
 is in itself so grateful after vicissitude. 
---
that he had ever shown any awkward aberrancies
---
he
 daily mounted to the parapets and copings of colleges he could never
 enter, and.


---
he
 would never look from,
---
as if he had known no wish to do otherwise
---
There was this change in him
---
; that he did not often go to any service
 at the churches now. 
---
One thing troubled him more than any other;

---
though he did not now
---
On a particular Sunday evening he came in rather late. 
---
when he found her silent and
 meditative
---
"" he asked curiously.


---
" Oh I ca n't tell clearly! 
---
I have thought
---
" Sue!" he murmured. 
---
But I have always striven. 
---
I have got
---
I wish, and all my monstrous errors, and all my sinful
 ways!"


---
as I could wish
---
he said,. 
---
" I ought
---
" I wo n't have it, Sue! 
---
he thought; but
---
he spoke softly, and. 
---
, Sue," he said. 
---
" I mean not only mentally, but about your
 clothes, also. 
---
I seem
---
" I have been to the service at St. Silas', and
---
I was in the fumes of
 it."


---
I go there sometimes.
---
I think and of my--" 
---
" And I have taken in there,."


---
" Oh well-- of course, I say nothing against it. 
---
Yet I know you
. 
---
" I wo n't.
---
But I am much surprised!"


---
" Well-- I want. 
---
I have thought of it a good deal.

---
I do n't think."


---
I ought as your wife-- any longer
---
to respect rites and
 ceremonies to be, I wonder? 
---
" I do n't think!"


---
I am
---
I should not feel even then. 
---
that I was
---
I should feel worse
.
---
than I do now
---
" Because I am Richard's.
---
; I feel--
---
I belong to him, or to nobody.
---
" Is Mr. Fawley here?"


---
Jude and Sue started.


---
as he mechanically replied in the affirmative,

---
He formally requested her, and
---
Jude had felt
---
it to be his duty
---
," said Jude drearily.


---
" He was my child, and
---
naturally I feel for him."


---
" I hope so. 
---
I did n't feel so much for,."


---
" I had often wished
---
I had mine with me
---
But of course I did n't wish
."


---
" I am not his wife,"
---
" Oh, I beg your pardon,
---
I'm sure
---
Jude had known from the quality of Sue's tone that her new and
 transcendental views lurked in her words; but
---
"," said Jude shortly.


---
" I do n't criticize.
---
"

" Ah-- I see! 
---
I am staying here to- night, and

---
I could do no less than call, after our mutual affliction
---
I am sleeping at the place where I used to be barmaid, and to- morrow

---
I go back to Alfredston. 
---
Father is come home again, and
---
I am living
 with him."


---
" He has returned from Australia?"
---
said Jude with languid curiosity.


---
Father and two
 of the young ones have just got back. 
---
He has got a cottage near the
 old place, and
---
for the present I am keeping house for him."


---
Jude was, and. 
---
The carpenter called his
 wife, who conjectured that Sue might have gone to St. Silas' church,
.


---
" Surely not at this time o' night?" said Jude. 
---
" Oh, some few weeks, I think."


---
Jude went vaguely in the direction of the church, which he had never
 once approached since he lived out that way years before, when his
 young opinions were more mystical than they were now. 
---
; he lifted the latch
 without noise, and. 
---
pushing to the door behind him, stood absolutely
 still inside
---
The floor- cloth deadened his footsteps.


---
as he
 moved in that direction through the obscurity, which was broken only
 by the faintest reflected night- light from without
---
High overhead, above the chancel steps, Jude could discern a huge,
 solidly constructed Latin cross-- as large, probably,. 
---
that he had heard before
---
It was
 his Sue's form, prostrate on the paving.


---
" Sue!" he whispered.


---
he retorted in quick reproach, for his full heart
.

---
Richard to be my husband!"


---
said Jude,
---
He returned vehemently:
---
" I do! 
---
I am
 glad I had nothing to do with Divinity-- damn glad-- if it's going to
 ruin you in this way!"


---
perhaps I shall. 
---
I am
 overburdened-- and
---
He put his arm
 and; but
---
" I do n't dislike you, Jude
---
" But surely we are man and wife,? 
---
because you are like a totally deaf man

---
I ca n't help
 being as I am, I am convinced I am right-- that I see the light at
 last. ," said
 Jude when she came back, feeling a slight renewal of elasticity now
 that he was in the open street;
---
" I ca n't bear it! 
---
I was in error--
---
I can not reason with you.

---
I was wrong-- proud in my own conceit! 
---
He flung his arms round her and. 
---
He went and. 
---
that
 Jude had followed her, and
---
But I wanted, and!"

": men ca n't, because they-- won't.
---
Your wickedness was only the natural man's desire
 to possess the woman. 
---
I had thought I ought in charity to
 I did my other friend.  But I should n't have given way... -- my wife,!" he burst out;
---
" At first I did not love you, Jude; that I own.  When I first knew
 I did not exactly flirt with
 you; but that inborn craving which undermines some women's morals
 almost more than unbridled passion-- the craving to attract and
 captivate, regardless of the injury it may do the man and
 when I found I had caught you, I was.  And then-- I do n't
 know-- I could n't bear-- and so I got. " And now you add to your cruelty by leaving me!"


---
The further I flounder, the more harm I do!"

" O Sue!" said he with a sudden sense of his own danger. 
---
what a weak
 fellow I am
---
since you became my guardian- angel
---
Since I have had you
---
I have been
 able to go into any temptations of the sort, without risk. 
---
I am in
 terror
---
lest,, it will be with me another case of the
 pig that was washed turning back to his wallowing in the mire!"


---
I'll pray for you night and day!"


---
" Well-- never mind; do n't grieve," said Jude generously. 
---
" I did
 suffer,; and
---
now I suffer again.

---
"-- I fear!... 
---
" I must n't stay?--
---
I am in your hands, Jude
---
now I have advanced so far
---
I do your bidding. 
---
I owe that to you, darling, in
 penance for how I overruled it at the first time. 
---
I was
---
Perhaps-- perhaps I spoilt one of the highest and
 purest loves that ever existed between man and woman!... 
---
He went to the bed,.


---
But I
 ca n't say any more
---
" Good- night," he said, and.


---
" I
 can't--
---
He clasped her, and and
---
as he had scarcely ever
 done before
---
We'll be dear friends just the same,
 Jude,
---
Jude did not permit himself, but.




---
On the day before the tragedy of the children, Phillotson had seen
 both her and Jude. 
---
But he had said nothing of it at the
 moment to his companion Gillingham, who, being an old friend, was
 staying with him at the village aforesaid, and had, indeed, suggested
 the day's trip to Christminster.


---
he added," Susanna
---
when Gillingham had gone back to his school
 near Shaston, Phillotson
---
as he walked down
 the long hill which he had known before Jude knew it,
---
though his
 history had not beaten so intensely upon its incline
---
he bought his usual weekly local paper
---
when he had sat
 down in an inn
---
to refresh himself for the five miles' walk back, he
 pulled the paper from his pocket and. 
---
I ought. The account of the
" strange suicide of a stone- mason's children" met his eye.


---
as he was
---
Unimpassioned, it impressed him painfully, and. 
---
for he could not understand the age of the elder child

---
he said: and.


---
though Jude
 had seen no more of her
---
Phillotson was on his way homeward, and
---
when he
 encountered Arabella
---
"" he said.


---
I've just begun to again
---
" He's not her husband, after all. 
---
although they have passed as man and wife so long
---
", the eldest boy was mine--"

" Oh-- yours!"


---
Father to look after now
---
When Phillotson had ascended the hill a few steps he
 stopped,
---
Meanwhile Phillotson ascended to Marygreen, and
---
for the first time
 during a lengthened period he lived with a forward eye. 
---
to which
 he had been reduced
---
On crossing
 under the large trees of the green to the humble schoolhouse he stood a moment, and. 
---
No man had ever suffered more inconvenience
 from his own charity, Christian or heathen,. 
---
than Phillotson had done
 in letting Sue go
---
He had been knocked about from pillar and.
---
; he had been
---
where the parson had got of for befriending him
---
He had often thought of Arabella's remarks
. 
---
that he should have been more severe with Sue,
---
Yet such was his obstinate and
 illogical disregard of opinion, and
---
in which he had
 been trained
---
of the principles, that his convictions on the rightness of his course
 with his wife had not been disturbed.


---
him to give Sue
---
The instincts her liberty now enabled him. 
---
He wished for her still,
.


---
in his curious way, if he did not love her, and
---
that he would be gratified
---
, he had found, for stemming the cold and
 inhumane blast of the world's contempt. 
---
By getting Sue back and remarrying her on the
 respectable plea of having entertained erroneous views of her, and
 gained his divorce wrongfully, he might acquire some comfort, resume
 his old courses, if not even to
 the Church as a licentiate.


---
He thought and

---
he would write to Gillingham,
---
what he thought of his
---
, Phillotson's, sending a letter to her.

---
as his attachment to her seemed
 unusually strong
---
He wrote a brief reply to Gillingham. 
---
As to had
 three children by him, my feeling is. 
---
As he had made up his mind
---
before he had written to his
 friend
---
However, it was Phillotson's way to act thus.


---
He accordingly addressed a carefully considered epistle to Sue, and,
. 
---
He stated
---
that, it having come to his
 knowledge
---
, he felt compelled
. 
---
that his own, too, were largely modified by events subsequent
 to their parting
---
He would not conceal from her. 
---
that passionate
 love had little to do with his communication
---
It arose from a wish
 to make their lives, if not a success, at least no such disastrous
 failure as they threatened to become, through his acting on what
 he had considered at the time a principle of justice, charity, and
 reason.


---
To indulge one's instinctive and uncontrolled sense of justice and
 right, was not, he had found,. 
---
He suggested.


---
On second thoughts he took out the last paragraph but one; and
---
he dispatched it immediately
---
A few days after a figure moved through the white fog which enveloped
 the Beersheba suburb of Christminster, towards the quarter in which
 Jude Fawley had taken up his lodging since his division from Sue. 
---
A
 timid knock sounded upon the door of his abode.


---
so he was at home; and
---
by a species of divination he
 jumped up and.


---
Jude put on his hat. 
---
I can see her views on the indissolubility
 of marriage well enough, and I know.  I shall make use of them to further mine."

" I know I am entirely wrong,
 but I do n't agree with you. ( though I can advance no logical
 or moral defence of it, on the old lines) I shall write to her, and."

," he said.

---
" But not to come in, I do n't mind."


---
" Yes-- I do. 
---
I shall not keep you long."


---
Jude was too much affected to go on talking at first
---
" I want her voice now quick, now
 slow," so that you may not hear of it by chance. 
---
He has
---
How can you go--"

" He is going. 
---
He turned upon her with an anguish that was well- nigh fierce.


---
if
 he asked me
---
, therefore I concede a repetition of the ceremony... 
---
Do n't
 crush all the life out of me by satire and argument, I implore you!

---
I was strongest once, and
---
I know,
---
perhaps I treated you cruelly.

---
But Jude, return good for evil! 
---
I am the weaker now. 
---
He shook his head hopelessly, his eyes wet. 
---
he said huskily.

---
Do you care for
 him? 
---
Do you love him? 
---
I do n't love him
---
"-- I must, must, own it, in deepest remorse! 
---
But I
 shall try."


---
Jude argued,; but
---
" I have been considerate enough
---
he coming? 
---
He wo n't condescend?
---
Every successful man is more or less a
 selfish man. 
---
Jude had no heart. 
---
could he go
 anywhere in the direction by which she would be likely to pass.

---
He went in an opposite one, to a dreary, strange, flat scene, where
 boughs dripped, and coughs and consumption lurked, and where he had
.


---
he murmured miserably.


---
It had been her request to Phillotson that he should not meet
 her. 
---
if he had found the master's
 house open
---
The man informed her.


---
that he had, and
---
Phillotson stood in the middle of the room,.


---
He was so stirred by her pitiful words and tone that he did more than
. 
---
he had meant
---
He bent and.


---
her flesh quivering under the touch of
 his lips.


---
Phillotson's heart sank, for desire. 
---
him know
---
he highly approves. 
---
-- he says
---
-- I have been driving through the damp, and I was
 chilly!" He's been good enough
."


---
Her look
 was that of the condemned criminal who catches sight of his coffin.


---
" What?" said Phillotson.


---
Yes," said Phillotson. 
---
Gillingham now joined them from his room above, and
---
Phillotson crossed the green with her,
.


---
" Oh-- I did n't know!"
---
what I do n't feel I bought it long
 ago-- to please Jude.  It must be destroyed!"


---
You be t' other man's. 
---
" Yes I must-- I am his already!"

" Richard says, and
---
he'll have me back
---
If he had
 refused
---
Phillotson in the interval had gone back to his friend Gillingham,
. 
---
after a silence he said,". 
---
I suppose. 
---
I am right in taking her at her word
---
I confess

---
So I may get back in some degree into my old
 track."


---
I was always against your opening the cage- door
 and. 
---
I did myself irreparable damage
---
"-- I know it."


---
Phillotson was more evasive to- night. 
---
He did not care. 
---
his taking Sue to him again
---
He said,
". 
---
Yes-- I shall do that
---
I know woman better now. 
---
"

 Gillingham looked at him, and.


---
induced by the world's sneers and his own
 physical wishes
---
than he had erstwhile
---
I perceive
---
" to give way to impulse," Phillotson resumed,
. 
---
" I flew in the face of the Church's teaching; but
---
I did it
 without malice prepense. 
---
However, I know myself
 better now. 
---
though Phillotson did not say so
---
" I
 remember
---
Phillotson said" Good- night.
---
But I was
 so headstrong at that time that I paid no heed.  And that after the
 divorce she should have thought of doing so I did not dream."

 that Mr. Phillotson," said Mrs. Edlin
---
" I was going over
. 
---
I've been upstairs with her,"


---
upon my word, sir, I do n't think!
---
I was never much for religion
 nor against it, but
---
But for my
 part I do n't.
---
I am willing
---
," said Phillotson with grave
 reserve, opposition making him illogically tenacious now. 
---
" I do n't believe it. 
---
he loves her dearly; and
---
The one man wo n't allow. 
---
'
 mind, I wonder!"


---
" I ca n't tell. 
---
Phillotson spoke stiffly. 
---
" Well, I knowed; but I do n't
 mind that. 
---
" I'm not affronted, Mrs. Edlin. 
---
But I must be allowed. 
---
I suppose?
---
if I can
---
I do n't know! 
---
I do n't know!

---
When I and my poor man were jined in it
---
When Mrs. Edlin had gone back to her cottage Phillotson
---
" I do n't know."


---
whether I ought
---
I ought
."


---
" I ca n't very well put it off now
---
But I had a qualm
."


---
I mean, and
---
that I did n't urge more objections to your letting her
 go
---
I sha n't be content."


---
if I do n't
 help you
---
Phillotson nodded, and. 
---
how staunch his friend was
---
what I've done
---
" No doubt I shall
 be thought a soft fool by many. 
---
as I do
---
that I
 do n't think
---
The next morning came, and the self- sacrifice of the woman on the
 altar of what she was pleased to call her principles was acquiesced
 in by these two friends, each from his own point of view. 
---
Phillotson
 went across to the Widow Edlin's. 
---
But he checked his impulse.


---
which unpleasantly lingered in his mind
---
" Up here," said Phillotson; and
---
he said pleasantly:"."


---
for the second or third time he felt.


---
he was not

---
which had induced him
---
the vicar congratulated the husband
 and wife on having performed a noble, and righteous, and mutually
 forgiving act. 
---
"," he said.

---
He, too, congratulated the couple. 
---
" Now," he said in parting
 from Phillotson, who walked out a little way,
---
" I shall be able to
 tell the people in your native place a good round tale; and
---
compunction wrought on him at sight of it.


---
" Of course, my dear, I sha n't expect
---
than I did before
---
to intrude upon your personal
 privacy any more," he said gravely. 
---
The place was the door of Jude's lodging in the out- skirts of
 Christminster-- far from the precincts of St. Silas' where he had
 formerly lived, which saddened him to sickness. 
---
I am lonely, destitute, and houseless
---
what I am
---
Father has

---
I'd got
---
when I was only

---
I am at the mercy of the world! 
---
help me, Jude, I must go to the workhouse, or to
 something worse. 
---
as I
 came along
---
where there's so
 many young men
---
" I am sorry for you, but
---
I am only in lodgings
---
," said Jude coldly.


---
" I'll give you enough."


---
I can not endure
; and
---
I am so lonely. 
---
" No, no," said Jude hastily. 
---
" I do n't want; and
---
I shall not help you."


---
" Then I suppose!
---
I must go
---
"," said Jude. 
---
" And I have only a little extra room
 to my own-- not much more than a closet-- where I keep my tools, and
 templates, and the few books I have left!"


---
Unable to be harsh with her, and not knowing what to do, Jude called
 the man who let the lodgings, and.


---
this was an acquaintance of
 his in great distress for want of temporary shelter
---
" My father has insulted me this afternoon, and
---
I've
 left him, though without a penny!"


---
he could not recall her features
---
if you are a friend of Mr. Fawley's
---
if he'll make himself answerable
---
" Yes, yes," said Jude. 
---
I should wish." 
---
", he'll have a chance of getting back to his old
 position, by everybody's account
---
All his well- wishers
 will be pleased, including the bishop himself."


---
When Jude suggested London as
 affording the most likely opening in the liquor trade
---
when he breakfasted later than on
 other days
---
" Yes,," he said indifferently.


---
You seem all
 in a brood, old man
---
Jude could not bear to acquiesce in this proposal; but
---
his suspense
 pitted itself against his discretion, and. 
---
," he said. 
---
" I've not heard a sound from
 there. 
---
" I am afraid I have n't enough cash to take me there and back, or
---
I
 should have gone before. 
---
I must wait.
---
till I have earned some
---
" Oh-- I can pay the journey for you
---
," he said impatiently. 
---
, moved
 him thought of choosing deliberately.


---
he would have

---
Jude requesting her. 
---
he said:"! 
---
Why should I
 have charged her
---
But having finished work he could not help
---
He merely said" Well?" with the very
 reverse of a smile.


---
he returned. 
---
he was her
 only husband
---
while he lived
---
He closed that issue by remarking abruptly:". 
---
And he left her straightway.


---
In his misery and depression Jude walked to well- nigh every spot
 in the city that he had visited with Sue; thence he did not know
 whither, and then thought of going home to his usual evening meal.

---
But having all the vices of his virtues, and, he turned
 into a public house, for the first time during many months. 
---
Jude
 did not return. 
---
where her father
 lived, and
---
He's on the
 loose
---
first hastening back to Jude's to
 make sure that he had not returned,. 
---
which Jude had formerly frequented
---
than her eyes fell upon him--
---
with his eyes fixed on the floor in a
 blank stare
---
He was drinking nothing stronger than ale just then.

---
He did not observe her, and
---
Jude looked up, and?... 
---
that he was a little way on
 in liquor, but only a little as yet
---
-- that's better fit
 for a man of education than beer. 
---
Jude had the pleasure of being,. 
---
where he drank
---
Her tone towards him to- night was uniformly soothing and cajoling;
 and
---
whenever he said"
---
I do n't care," a thing
---
he
 did continually, she replied,"!" 
---
But I do very much
---
so that he'll have
---
" Anything-- anywhere," replied Jude. 
---
They went along together, like any other fuddling couple, her arm
 still round his waist, and his, at last, round hers; though with no
 amatory intent; but merely because he was weary, unstable, and in
 need of support.


---
," he stammered. 
---
" I remember-- in old Fuller's_ State_--and I am reminded of it-- by our passing by here-- old Fuller
 in his_ Holy State_ says, that at the burning of Ridley, Doctor
 Smith-- preached sermon, and took as his text_'
---
They had reached her father's house, and
---
But Jude did not think of that,.


---
," said Jude.


---
I'll lead you. 
---
I'll pull off your boots. 
---
I do n't want.
---
He'd make a row, perhaps."


---
" I have n't been inside it for years till now! 
---
I want
---
," he said casually. 
---
" I've. 
---
at least till I get
---
" Well, for to- day I ca n't say." 
---
" I've got a prize upstairs."


---
It's Jude. 
---
He's come back to me."


---
I'm
---
" Well, I always did,
---
like him that I will say.
---
" But how does he come?"
---
till he and I are--
---
He's no
 catch, to my thinking. 
---
though for a man to want his old wife back--
---
" He told me this morning, and
---
that his head ached
 fit to burst
---
he hardly seemed. 
---
where he was
---
how he mixed his drink last night
---
We must keep
 him jolly and cheerful here for a day or two, and. 
---
him go back
 to his lodging
---
how he is now, poor deary
---
the fragility of his ordinary appearance, and his long lashes,
 dark brows, and curly back hair and beard against the white pillow
 completed the physiognomy of one whom Arabella, as a woman of rank
 passions, still felt it worth while to recapture, highly important
 to recapture as a woman straitened both in means and in reputation.

---
Her ardent gaze seemed; his quick breathing became
 suspended, and he opened his eyes.


---
because he could not bear
 the daylight in his throbbing eye- balls
---
Quite indifferent, and shutting his eyes, Jude seemed to doze again.

---
Jude was in such physical pain from his unfortunate break- down of
 the previous night, and
---
when he saw his few chattels unpacked and standing before his eyes in
 this strange bedroom
---
in such mental pain from the loss of Sue and
 from having yielded in his half- somnolent state to Arabella, that
, intermixed with woman's apparel, he scarcely
 considered, or.


---
if he once gets into that fearfully low state that he
 does get into sometimes
---
, he'll never do the honourable thing by me
 in this world, and
---
He must be kept
 cheerful. 
---
He has a little money in the savings bank, and
---
he has

---
he's in the humour
---
when Jude had recovered somewhat from the fearful
 throbbing of his eyes and brain, but
---
what had been supplied to him by Arabella during
 the interval-- to keep him, jolly, as she expressed it-- the quiet
 convivial gathering, suggested by her, to wind Jude up to the
 striking point,
---
Jude was asked. 
---
if he could suggest any guest
 in addition to those named by Arabella and her father, and
---
whom he remembered as
 having been frequenters of the well- known tavern during his bout
 therein years before
---
He also suggested Freckles and Bower o' Bliss.

---
though he lived in the same
 street
---
Another man, Tinker Taylor,, was not invited; but
---
as he went homeward from a late job on
 the evening of the party
---
, he had occasion to call at the shop for
 trotters. 
---
he was promised some the next
 morning. 
---
his inquiry Taylor glanced into the back room
---
He went home to
 bed, and
---
He thought it hardly worth while to call at the shop for his
 provisions at that hour, Donn and his daughter. 
---
However, he found in passing
, and
---
he could hear voices within,. 
---
He went and.


---
he said,
---
precisely as he had left them eleven hours earlier
---
I shall lose a quarter, but
---
" never mind,"
 he said. 
---
" Well, really, I could hardly believe my eyes! 
---
when I looked
 in
---
as if I was flung back again into last night, all of a
 sudden
---
He now perceived round his waist. 
---
Jude, like the rest of the company, bore on.


---
how deeply he had been indulging
---
" Jude and I
 have decided,
. 
---
Jude seemed. 
---
" Yes, I told him last night;
---
He highly
 approved."


---
" Oh very well, I'm ready
---
," said her father,.


---
who did not know him
---
"," said Jude doggedly. 
---
I wo n't mention her in this Capharnaum!"


---
" Now, Mr. Fawley be honourable
---
Jude went upstairs with her, and
---
to speak against friends," he said. 
---
he'll do it
---
" He's been put upon his honour by the woman,
---
so he med."


---
" He'd hardly do it straight off like this. 
---
He's got no licence nor
 anything.
---
after a time he came in with a leer on his
 face.


---
" Take my word, he turned
 rusty at the last minute. 
---
" Certainly.  Mrs. Fawley again," replied Arabella blandly,. 
---
Well, he was a very nice, gentlemanly man indeed. 
---
I mean

---
He said to me as gentle as a babe when all was done:
'
---
Mrs. Fawley, I congratulate you heartily
---
,' he says. 
---
that of your husband, I think. 
---
And for your past errors as a wife,
 and his as a husband, I think
---
,' says he. 
---
Yes; he was a very
 nice, gentlemanly man. 
---
strictly speaking,' he says:' and.' 
---
no man put asunder
---
Yes; he was a very nice,
 gentlemanly man... 
---
though I
 knew
---
" I want-- some-- more whisky," said Jude stolidly.


---
who had lived but
 a short time in her father's house after their remarriage
---
Jude and his wife,, were in
 lodgings on the top floor of a dwelling nearer to the centre of the
 city.


---
He had done a few days' work during the two or three months since
 the event, but
---
his health had been indifferent, and
---
He was sitting in an arm- chair before the fire, and

---
" Ah, yes!" said he,. 
---
" I have been thinking of
 my foolish feeling about the pig
---
I feel now."


---
as I served

---
as he had seen
---
he was about to give them notice to quit, till by
 chance overhearing her one night haranguing Jude in rattling terms,
 and ultimately flinging a shoe at his head
---
, he recognized the note of
 genuine wedlock; and
---
Jude did not get any better, and
---
one day he requested Arabella, with
 considerable hesitation, to execute a commission for him. 
---
he pleaded. 
---
He felt.


---
that his physical weakness had
 taken away all his dignity
---
Almost as soon Jude sprang from the chair,
 and
---
he had her on her back upon a
 little couch which stood there
---
, he kneeling above her.


---
," he whispered,"
---
"," he said scornfully. 
---
as he loosened her
---
I ca n't say.
---
I could n't kill you-- even in a passion.

---
He then began, and
---
as he sank back ghastly pale
---
" I'll send for her
---
The softer side of his nature, the desire to see Sue, made him unable
 to resist the offer even now,; and
---
as he had been
---
he replied
 breathlessly:. 
---
" Yes, I agree
---
In the evening he inquired.


---
The next day Jude wondered, but. 
---
He knew the times of the possible trains,
 and.


---
Jude would not address Arabella again thereon.

---
He hoped and; but
---
Then Jude decided in the privacy of his
 mind. 
---
His physical
 weakness was such that he shed tears at the disappointment when she
 was not there to see. 
---
His suspicions were, in fact,.

---
He never said another word to her about his wish or his conjecture.

---
A silent, undiscerned resolve grew up in him,. 
---
which gave him, if not
 strength, stability and calm
---
my man gone to
---
looking from the window at the
 dripping spouts it seemed impossible to believe that any sick man
 would have ventured out to almost certain death. 
---
that he had gone out

If he's such a fool

---
Jude was at that moment in a railway train that was drawing near to
 Alfredston,
---
An hour later his thin form,
 in the long great- coat and blanket he had come with, but
---
By the up- hill walk he was quite blown, but
---
he pressed on; and
---
; Jude crossed the green to the
 church without observation, and. 
---
Here he
 stood,
---
looking forth at the school, whence he could hear the usual
 sing- song tones of the little voices that had not learnt Creation's
 groan.


---
He waited. 
---
till a small boy came from the school--
---
Jude held up his
 hand, and
---
Jude heard. 
---
him knock at the door of the
 dwelling
---
He himself went further into the church. 
---
He stood by these:

---
they seemed akin to the perished people of that place who were his
 ancestors and Sue's.

 A light footstep, which might have been accounted no more than an
,
---
he looked
 round.


---
He advanced, but

---
he implored. 
---
him to come closer
---
And you too-- you call yourself Phillotson's wife!

---
He is a kind husband to me--
---
, you are
 not worth a man's love!"


---
her eye resting on him a moment
---
He
 suggested it at the very first!"


---
" Sue!" he said. 
---
Pressing her to him in his arms, he bruised her
 lips with kisses.
---
", I have a moment's
 happiness now! 
---
" I do! 
---
But I MUSTN'T do this! 
---
I must n't
 kiss you back!"


---
as I would
---
-- I CAN'T go on with this!"
---
" But there,
 there, darling; I give you back your kisses
---
I do
---
;, I do!... 
---
And now
 I'll HATE myself for ever for my sin!"


---
I was made drunk. 
---
I was gin- drunk
---
But I've got over myself now. 
---
Jude did.

---
He did not turn his head, but. 
---
As he passed the end of the church
---
his coughs mingling with the rain on the windows
---
He was by this time at the corner of the green, from which the path
 ran across the fields in which he had scared rooks as a boy. 
---
He
 turned and; and
---
that his eyes would light on that
 scene no more
---
his
 former strength being insufficent to maintain his heat
---
He came to
 the milestone, and,. 
---
Before moving on he went and. 
---
He passed the spot where the gibbet of his
 ancestor and Sue's had stood, and.


---
It was dark,
 the deadly chill that began to creep into his bones being too much
 for him to endure fasting. 
---
when he reached Alfredston, where he had a cup of tea
---
To get home he had a steam
 tram- car, and two branches of railway, with much waiting at a
 junction. 
---
He did not reach Christminster till ten o'clock.




---
"," said Jude, literally tottering with cold and lassitude.


---
The water ran out of him, and
---
as he went
---
he was compelled.


---
You've done for yourself by this, young man
---
Jude kept.


---
The expression of Jude's corpselike face in the watery lamplight was
 indeed. 
---
as if he saw people where there was nobody
---
At moments he
 stood still by an archway,
---
; then
 he would look at a window like one discerning a familiar face behind
 it. 
---
He seemed.


---
whose words he repeated
---
," he said;
---
as he paused
---
, holding to the
 railings, he measured with his eye the height of a college front.

---
I'll treat you
---
for I feel the chilly fog from
 the meadows of Cardinal
---
As Antigone said, I am neither a dweller among men nor
 ghosts.  when I am dead You are tough enough yet, old
 man."




---
at which Jude and Arabella were

---
He'll get a better school,
---
Husband cross?"


---
He never is. 
---
He's gone to bed early.
---
Jude has been here this
 afternoon, and
---
" I can not tell you.  I have done wrong to- day. And I want...  Well-- I will tell you this-- I find I still love him-- I can not tell
 you more."

" Ah!" said the widow. 
---
since he agrees to it being otherwise, and
---
I have not told my husband of his visit as I never mean But I am going. I must!"

" Yes-- he agrees to my living; but
---
it is an
 indulgence I ought not to exact from him
---
you do n't like in him
---
as I choose I feel.  but I must be more
 just to him.  O why was I so unheroic!"

" I can not tell you.  I can not say. " Did you ever tell Jude?"

" Never."


---
But I do n't know...  I've screwed my weak soul up to treating him more
 courteously-- and" I do n't think. " It is my duty. 
---
A man could be heard. 
---
he did not reply.

---
" I be old and slow,
 and" I-- don't hear him! " Perhaps he's dead!"
---
No-- he's snoring again. 
---
" And then-- I should be FREE, and I
 could go to Jude!...  Ah-- no-- I forgot HER-- and God!"

 But the rain and the
 wind is so loud that you can hardly hear anything but between
 whiles."


---
He pulled
 on some articles of clothing, and. 
---
he was coming
---
him kiss me
---
as I have said" But I beg."  I beg I have been in error-- even to- day. I have
 exceeded my rights.  I did not mean, but perhaps I ought.
 I sinned against you this afternoon." How?"

" I met Jude!  I did n't know. " I kissed him, and."

" Richard, I did n't know!"

 I do n't know.  I am and
 the least I can do."

" Come-- this is pretty bad, after what I've done! 
---
He spoke of some things of the past, and
---
He spoke of-- the children. 
---
There was something in Phillotson's tone now show that his three months of remarriage with Sue had somehow not
 been so satisfactory as his magnanimity or amative patience had
 anticipated.


---
I called him my darling Love I am never going But, as I have said, I am glad-- almost
 glad I mean-- that they are dead, Richard. " Perhaps you'll swear it on the New Testament?"


---
He went back to the room and.

---
But..."  He gloomily considered her thin and fragile
 form a moment longer as she crouched before him in her night- clothes.

---
" Well, I thought," he said presently. 
---
" I owe
 you nothing, after these signs; but
---
I'll take you in at your word,
 and."


---
He put his arm round her to lift her up. 
---
he asked,.

---
I-- I-- was not thinking--"


---
Placing the candlestick on the chest of drawers he led her through
 the doorway, and. 
---
since my man and I married

 Despite himself Jude recovered somewhat, and. 
---
After Christmas, however, he broke down again.


---
he had earned
---
With the money he shifted his lodgings to a yet more
 central part of the town. 
---
that he was not likely
, and
---
Jude was absolutely indifferent to what she said, and
---
Sometimes his mood was more
 earnest, and
---
as he lay
---
he often rambled on upon the defeat of his
 early aims.


---
Every man has some little power in some one direction
---
"," he would
 say. 
---
On one occasion while soliloquizing thus he called her" Sue"
 unconsciously.


---
he did not catch the word.


---
One day he received a surprise. 
---
where his
 affections were centred
---
He
 impulsively asked, and?"


---
I suppose
---
they are still only husband and
 wife in name
---
he asked quickly.


---
He did n't wish it, but
---
which enlarge the views of most men
---
how
 I go on to myself continually,
---
as I lie here
---
I must be
---
I could hearken to' ee all day.
---
As Jude reflected more and more on her news, and
---
grew more restless,
 he began in his mental agony. 
---
Poor chap, he got excited, and do blaspeam
 terribly,-- the more to my
 blame. 
---
But there-- you must excuse a man in suffering for what he
 says, and
---
God will forgive him
---
though Jude had hitherto taken the medicines of
 that skilful practitioner with the greatest indifference
---
whenever
 poured down his throat by Arabella
---
, he was now so brought to bay by
 events that he vented his opinion of Vilbert in the physician's face,
 and so forcibly, and. 
---
At the door he met Arabella, Mrs. Edlin
. 
---
how he thought, and
---
her husband was
 now
---
He assented.


---
he drank.


---
" he asked,.


---
he kissed her
 there and then.


---
My man will
 hear."


---
he will soon
---
The last pages are concerned with the scene in and out of Jude's
 bedroom
---
His face was now so thin that his old friends would hardly have known
 him. 
---
He seemed to
 be sleeping,.


---
though his position was an elevated one, his malady

---
Why ever
 does n't Father come
---
Still he slept, and. 
---
They reached so far as to the room in which
 Jude lay; and
---
that his cough began again and

---
as he could speak
---
As soon he murmured
---
, his eyes still closed:" A
 little water, please."


---
Nothing but the deserted room received his appeal, and
---
he coughed
 to exhaustion again--" Water-- some
 water-- Sue-- Arabella!"


---
Presently he gasped again:
" Throat-- water--
---
While he remained
---
his face changing
---
The Remembrance games," he murmured. 
---
Jude's
 face changed more
---
: he whispered slowly, his parched lips scarcely
 moving:

_
---
the servant is
 free from his master. 
---
Wherefore is light given to him that is in
 misery, and life unto the bitter in soul?"
---
It was full of bustle, and brilliant
 in the sunlight with flowers and other preparations for a ball
 here also. 
---
A carpenter nodded to her, one who had formerly been a
 fellow- workman of Jude's. 
---
how your husband is
---
He's sleeping nicely
---
how he is now
---
Father is
 with him,."


---
that her father had not even now come
---
" Why could n't he have been here!"
---
He wants
---
that Jude was apparently sleeping,
---
though he was not in the usual
 half- elevated posture necessitated by his cough
---
He had slipped
 down, and. 
---
His face was quite white, and. 
---
though his body was
 still warm
---
he should die just
 now
---
Why did he die just now!" 
---
Well, how is he? 
---
He wo n't wake yet
---
" And-- it
 ca n't hurt my husband--."


---
" he said with a leer. 
---
" I sha n't talk of love to- day."


---
" But I think. 
---
I must
 get back to my poor man
---
Father is there, so far as I know; but
---
I
 had better get back."


---
" Well, I must go... 
---
if Jude were
 discovered
---
My husband has just gone, poor soul
---
By ten o'clock that night Jude was lying on the bedstead at his
. 
---
Two days later,, two persons stood beside Jude's open coffin in the
 same little bedroom. 
---
They were both looking at Jude's face,.


---
" How beautiful he is!
---
He's a' andsome corpse
---
The cheers come from the
 young men."


---
while the old, superseded, Delphin editions of Virgil and
 Horace, and the dog- eared Greek Testament on the neighbouring shelf,
 and the few other volumes of the sort that he had not parted with
---
where he had been in the habit of catching
 them up for a few minutes between his labours
---
An occasional word, as from some one making a speech, floated from
 the open windows of the theatre across to this quiet corner, to be a smile of some sort upon the marble features
 of Jude;,
 roughened with stone- dust, seemed. 
---
Arabella's eyes removed from Jude to Mrs. Edlin. 
---
If Jude had been alive
---
" to see her, he would hardly have cared for
 her any more, perhaps.
---
Did n't he ever ask you,?"


---
since he came
---
he said."


---
I was not

---
how ill he was
---
" Did he forgive her?"


---
as I know
---
as he is now
