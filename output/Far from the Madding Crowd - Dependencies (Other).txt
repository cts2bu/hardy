 it stood in the scale of public opinion,

spread out
 at the base by tight jamming upon the head for security
 in high winds, and a coat like Dr. Johnson's

 stand in a river all day long and

what may be called a small silver clock
---
watch,-
; in other
 words, it was a watch as to shape and intention, and
 a small clock as to size.
---
The smaller
 of its hands, too, occasionally slipped round on the
 pivot, and
---
thus, though the minutes were told with
 precision
---
, nobody could be quite certain of the hour
 they belonged to.
---
remedied by thumps and shakes
---
It may be mentioned.

who had seen

that many of the hues and
 curves of youth had tarried on to manhood
---
had they been exhibited
 with due consideration

rural and urban alike, for which the mind is more
 responsible than flesh and sinew
---
:  it is a way of curtail-
 ing their dimensions by their manner of showing them.

---
This may be said.

---
at which" young"
 is ceasing
---
wherein they become united again, in the character of
 prejudice,
---
The field sloped to a
 ridge called Norcombe Hill.
---
Casually glancing over the hedge
---
,
 drawn by two horses, a waggoner walking alongside
 bearing a whip perpendicularly
---
The waggon was
 laden with household goods and window plants, and
.
---
The tailboard of the waggon is gone,
---
" Miss." said the
 waggoner.

---
" Then I heard."
---
it fall
---
" I heard a noise."

---
I could
 not account for when we were coming up the hill
---
" I'll run back."

---
The sensible horses stood-- perfectly still, and
---
the
 waggoner's steps sank fainter and fainter in the distance.

---
surrounded by tables and chairs with their legs upwards
---
backed by an oak settle, and,
---
ornamented in front by
 pots of geraniums, myrtles, and cactuses
---
There was also a cat in a willow
 basket, from the partly- opened lid of which
---
the only sound heard in the stillness
---
It
 was not at the bird, nor at the cat
---
; it was at an oblong
 package tied in paper, and.
---
if the waggoner were coming
---
untied the paper covering; a small swing
 looking- glass was disclosed,
---
It was a fine morning, and
---
The
 myrtles, geraniums, and cactuses packed around
---
at such a leafless season they
 invested the whole concern of horses, waggon, furniture,
 and girl with a peculiar vernal charm.
---
who were
 alone its spectators,--
---
whether the smile began as a
 factitious one,
---
; it ended certainly in a real smile
---
The picture was a delicate one.
---
which had

---
though likely dramas vistas of probable
 triumphs-- the smiles being of a phase suggesting
---
that
 hearts were imagined
---
Still, this was
 but conjecture, and.

---
the whole series of actions was
---
it rash
---
that intention
 had any part in them at all
---
The waggoner's steps were heard.
---
When the waggon had passed on
---
lt was a difference con-
 cerning twopence between the persons with the waggon
 and the man at the toll- bar.
"
---
Mis'ess's niece is upon the top of the things, and

---
that's enough
---
that I've offered ye, you great
 miser, and
---
These were the
 waggoner's words.
"
---
Very well; then mis'ess's niece ca n't pass."
---
said the
 turnpike- keeper,.

---
There was something in the
 tone of twopence remarkably insignificant.
---
Threepence
 had a definite value as money twopence--" Here."
---
-- it was an appreciable
 infringement on a day's wages, and, as such, a higgling
 matter; but
---
that not a single
 lineament could be selected and
---
we know.

---
The gatekeeper surveyed the retreating vehicle.

---
" And the greatest of them is--."

---
well, what it is
 always
---
piqued by the comely
 traveller's indifference
---
IT was nearly midnight on the eve of St. Thomas's, the
 shortest day in the year.
---
A desolating wind wandered
 from the north over the hill whereon Oak had watched
 the yellow waggon and its occupant in the sunshine of
 a few days earlier.
  
---
Norcombe Hill-- not far from lonely Toller- Down
 -- was one of the spots which suggest to
---
a passer- by
 to be found on earth.

---
It was a featureless convexity of chalk and soil-- an
 ordinary specimen of those smoothly- outlined protuber-
 ances of the globe which may remain undisturbed on
 some great day of confusion, when far grander heights
 and dizzy granite precipices topple down.

---
The hill was covered on its northern side by an
 ancient and decaying plantation of beeches
---
, whose
 upper verge formed a line over the crest,.
---
To- night
 these trees sheltered the southern slope from the keenest
 blasts, which smote the wood and floundered through
 it with a sound as of grumbling, or gushed over its
 crowning boughs in a weakened moan.
---
The dry leaves
 in the ditch
---
simmered and.
---
A group or
 two of the latest in date amongst the dead multitude
 had remained till this very mid- winter time on the twigs
 which bore them and in falling rattled against the trunks
 with smart taps
---
that its summit indistinctly com-
 manded, was a mysterious sheet of fathomless shade
 --
---
:
 Between this half- wooded, half naked hill, and the
 vague still horizon the sounds from which suggested.

---
what it con-

---
cealed
---
The thin grasses, more or less coating the hill
---
, were
 touched by the wind in breezes of differing powers, and
 almost of differing natures-- one rubbing the blades
 heavily, another raking them piercingly, another brushing
 them like a soft broom.
---
The instinctive act of human-
 kind was
---
how the trees
 to each other in the regular antiphonies of a cathedral
 choir; how hedges and other shapes to leeward them
; and
.

---
how the hurrying gust then plunged into the south,
---
The sky was clear-- remarkably clear-- and
---
the
 twinkling of all the stars seemed but throbs of
 one body, timed by a common pulse.
---
The North Star
 was directly in the wind's eye, and
---
since evening the
 Bear had swung round it outwardly to the east,.
---
A
 difference of colour in the stars-- oftener read of than
 seen in England- was really perceptible here.
---
The
 sovereign brilliancy of Sirius pierced the eye with a steely
 glitter,
---
the star called Capella was yellow, Aldebaran and
 Betelgueux.

---
To persons standing alone on a hill during a clear
 midnight such as this, the roll of the world eastward is
 almost a palpable movement.
---
The sensation may be

---
caused by the panoramic glide of the stars past earthly
 objects, which is perceptible in a few minutes of still-
 ness, or by the better outlook upon space that a hill
 affords, or by the wind, or by the solitude; but
---
, the impression of riding along is vivid and
 abiding.
---
The poetry of motion is a phrase much in
 use, and.
---
it
 is necessary to stand on a hill at a small hour of the
 night,
---
who are
 dreamwrapt and disregardful of all such proceedings at
 this time
---
After such a nocturnal reconnoitre
 it is hard.

---
that the
 consciousness of such majestic speeding is derived from
 a tiny human frame
---
Suddenly an unexpected series of sounds began.
---
They had a
 clearness which was to be found nowhere in the wind,
 and a sequence which was to be found nowhere in
 nature.
---
The tune was not floating unhindered into the open
 air
---
:  it seemed muffled in some way, and.
---
It came
 from the direction of a small dark object under the
 plantation hedge-- a shepherd's hut--.

---
to which an uninitiated person might have

---
The image as a whole was that of a small Noah's
 Ark on a small Ararat,.
---
which are followed by toy-
 makers-- and by these means
---
The
 hut stood on little wheels, which raised its floor about a
 foot from the ground.
---
Such shepherds' huts are dragged
 into the fields when the lambing season comes on,.

---
It was only latterly.
---
that people had begun
---
Norcombe Hill was a portion,
 and stock it with two hundred sheep.
---
The wind continued, but
---
the flute- playing ceased.
---
Fitness being the basis of beauty
---
, nobody
 could- have denied, Yet,

---
if occasion demanded
---
A close examination of the ground hereabout, even
 by the wan starlight only, revealed.
---
how a portion of
 what would have been casually called a wild slope
---
that had more mellowness than clearness
---
This
 continued.
---
united by a seemingly inconsiderable mem-
 brane about half the substance of the legs collectively,
 which constituted the animal's entire body just at present
---
, the cot being lighted
 by a candle suspended by a twisted wire.
---
A rather
 hard couch, formed of a few corn sacks thrown carelessly
 down, covered half the floor of this little habitation, and

---
In about the
 time a person unaccustomed to bodily labour would have
 decided
---
as it now presented itself
---
The inside of the hut,, was
 cosy and alluring, and the scarlet handful of fire in
 addition to the candle, flung associations of
 enjoyment even over utensils and tools.
---
whatever it could reach
---
In the corner
 stood the sheep- crook, and along a shelf at one side
 were ranged bottles and canisters of the simple prepara-
 tions pertaining to bovine surgery and physic; spirits of
 wine, turpentine, tar, magnesia, ginger, and castor- oil
 being the chief.
---
On a triangular shelf across the corner
 stood bread, bacon, cheese, and a cup for ale or cider,
 which was supplied from a flagon beneath.
---
Beside the
 provisions lay
---
whose notes had lately been

---
the flute called forth by the lonely watcher.
---
The house was ventilated by two round holes,
.
---
revived by the warmth
---
like the lights of a ship's cabin, with wood slides-
 The lamb, began,
---
as expected sounds will
---
that had accompanied the reverse

---
that the hour-
 hand had shifted again,,
---
The Dog- star and Aldebaran, pointing to the restless
 Pleiades, were half- way up the Southern sky, and
---
which gorgeous constellation never
 burnt more vividly than now,
---
as it soared forth above
 the rim of the landscape
---
will
 the north- west
---
Castor and Pollux; far away through the plantation Vega
 and Cassiopeia's chair stood.
---
Human shapes, interferences,
 troubles, and joys were all
---
as if they were not, and
---
Occupied this, with eyes stretched afar
---
that to be a star was in reality
---
It was an artificial light, almost close at hand.
 
---
where company
 is desirable
---
To find themselves utterly alone at night and expected makes some people fearful; but a
 case more trying by far to the nerves is.
 
---
when intuition, sensation, memory,
 analogy, testimony, probability, induction-- every kind of
 evidence in the logician's list-- have united
---
that it is quite in isolation
---
the site being
---
so that at
 its back part the roof was almost level with the ground
---
In
 front it was formed of board.

if you stay

It
 went over the hedge
---
, I think.
---
The cow standing erect was of the Devon breed, and.

---
as if the animal had been dipped in
 a dye of that colour
---
The other was spotted, grey and white.
---
which showed
---
that it had not long been
, and
---
which it apparently mistook for the moon
---
Between the sheep and the cows Lucina had
 been busy on Norcombe hill lately.
 
---
I think
---
we had better send for some oatmeal
---
I'll ride over for it as soon as it is light
---
But there's no side- saddle."

---
" I can ride on the other: ."

---
we colour and
---
whatever our eyes bring in
---
took
 up the lantern, and went out, the light sinking down
 the hill till it was no more than a nebula.
---
Even its position
 terrestrially is one of the elements of a new interest,
 and
---
for no particular reason save that the incident of
 the night had occurred there
---
It was not a bridle- path-- merely a
 pedestrian's track, and the boughs spread horizontally
 at a height not greater than seven feet above the ground,
 which made it impossible to ride erect beneath them.

---
who wore no riding- habit
---
that all humanity was
 out of view,
---
The tall lank
 pony seemed used to such doings, and.
---
The performer seemed quite at home anywhere
 between a horse's head and its tail, and the necessity
 for this abnormal attitude
---
that nobody was in sight
---
An hour passed
---
The left arm was extended as a balance, enough
 of
---
it being shown bare.
---
that the event
 ha happened in the summer,
---
when the whole would
 have been revealed
---
this rather saucy assumption failed in being offensive,

---
because a beholder felt
---
it to be, upon the whole, true
---
that
 which would have made mediocrity ridiculous
---
It was with some
 surprise.

---
selected by the judgment
---
The
 starting- point was.
---
the pail was a small one, and the
 hedge diminutive; hence,
---
All
 features of consequence were severe and regular.
---
It
 may have been observed by persons who go about the
 shires with eyes for beauty.

---
, that in Englishwoman a
 classically- formed face is seldom found,
---
the highly- finished
 features being generally too large for the remainder of
 the frame; that a graceful and proportionate figure of
 eight heads usually goes off into random facial curves
---
it be said
---
that here criticism checked itself as out
 of place, and
---
was natural, and almost certain.
---
The self-
 consciousness shown would have been vanity if a little
 more pronounced, dignity if a little less.
---
Rays of male
 vision seem
---
I found a hat.
---
" It is mine."
---
" it flew away last night
---
" Well-- it was.
---
How did you know?
---
" I was here."

---
", are you not?"
" That or thereabouts.
---
I'm lately come to this place."

---
which was black in the
 shaded hollows of its mass
---
it being now an hour
 past sunrise
---
, the rays touched its prominent curves with
 a colour of their own.
"
---
( In speaking
 of farms the word" acres" is omitted by the natives, by
 analogy to such old expressions as" a stag of ten.")

---
" I wanted my hat this morning."
---
" I had."

---
" Yes you had.
---
"
" How do you know?"

---
" I saw you!"

---
A perception caused.
---
Recollection of the strange antics indulged in when passing through the trees
---
what seemed
 and

---
Five mornings and evenings passed.
---
as without law there is no sin, without
 eyes
---
For, there is no indecorum; and
---
The acquaintanceship might, however, have ended in
 a slow forgetting, but for an incident which occurred at
 the end of the same week.
---
One afternoon it began, and
---
the frost increased with evening,.
---
which drew
 on like a stealthy tightening of bonds
---
It was a time
 when in cottages the breath of the sleepers freezes to
 the sheets
---
; when round the drawing- room fire of a
 thick- walled mansion the sitters' backs are cold,.
---
even
 whilst their faces are all aglow
---
Many a small bird went
 to bed supperless that night among the bare boughs.

---
The wind came in at the bottom of the door,
 and
---
Then the wind
 spouted in at a ventilating hole--.

---
of which there was one
 on each side of the hut
---
; on second-- thoughts the farmer con-
 sidered.
---
both
 closed for a minute or two
---
till the temperature of the
 hut was a little raised
---
that evening had sunk
 to dusk in a strange manner of unexpectedness
---
Whatever is the matter?"
---
since you are not
 dead
---
It is a wonder."

---
you were not
---
" I gave ten
 pounds for that hut.
---
But I'll sell it, and!
---
as they did in old times
---
It played me nearly the
 same trick the other day!"
---
" It was not exactly the fault of the hut."
---
which showed
---
" You
 should I think,."

---
Yes I suppose.
---
I should
---
How
 can I thank' ee?"
---
whatever that might prove
---
" How did you find me?"

---
I heard
---
your dog howling and
---
when I came to the milking
---
" scratching at the
 door of the hut( it was so
 lucky,
---
Daisy's milking is almost over for the season, and
 
---
I shall not come here after this week or the next).
---
The
 dog saw me, and.
---
I came across and.
---
if the slides were closed
---
I have heard.
---
I opened the door, and
---
there you were like
 dead.
---
I threw the milk over you,,."

---
as there was no
 water
---
it was warm,
---
" I wonder?"
---
if I should have died
---
" I believe
---
you saved my life, Miss-- --
---
I do n't know
 your name.
---
" I would just as soon not tell it-- rather not.
---
There
 is no reason either why I should, as you probably will
 never have much to do with me."
---
Still, I should like."

---
" And mine is n't.
---
You see
---
", it is the only one I shall ever have, and
---
I
 must make the most of it."

---
" I always think."

---
mine sounds odd and disagreeable
---
" I should think."

---
you might soon get a new one
---
you keep about you

---
" Well Miss- excuse the words- I thought But.
---
you
 would like them
---
I ca n't match you in
 napping out my mind upon my tongue
---
I know
---
I never was
 very clever in my inside.
---
But I thank you.
---
I am sorry."
---
You may have it again
---
if you like
---
"; there it is."

---
How soft it is--
---
There-- that's long enough."
---
you are thinking

---
you would like
---
if you want
---
" I was n't thinking of any such thing."
---
that is tolerable to the
 rival sex
---
that the farmer was quite struck with the
 resemblance
---
it lowering
---
nothing
 finished and ready to say as yet, and
---
which end
---
where they begin
---
that the cow would go
 dry in about seven days
---
At last the eighth day came.
---
The cow had ceased

 summer face and a winter constitution- a fine January
 morning

when there was just enough blue sky visible to
 make cheerfully- disposed people wish for more, and an
 occasional gleam of silvery sunshine

the dog walking behind, with a countenance of great
 concern at the serious turn pastoral affairs seemed.

sprigs
 of an elegant flower uniting the beauties of

mace
 round a nutmeg, or

wet seaweed round a boulder after
 the ebb
---
Nothing disturbed the stillness of the cottage
---
one
 might fancy scandal and rumour.
---
that the omen was an
 unpropitious one
---
The dog took no notice,
---
A voice came from behind some laurel- bushes into
 which
---
the cat had run:
" Poor dear!
---
I beg your pardon.
---
George was walking on behind me with a temper as
 mild as milk
---
Nobody appeared, and
---
the
 person retreat among the bushes

Where the issue of an interview is as likely
 to be a vast change for the worse as for the better,
 any initial difference from expectation causes nipping
 sensations of failure.
---
( Calling one's self merely Some-
 body, without giving a name, is
---
, of which townspeople,
 with their cards and announcements, have no notion
 whatever.
---
The voice had evidently been
 hers.

---
" Will you come in, Mr. Oak?"

---
I thought
---
" said Mrs. Hurst, musingly;".
---
If you will wait a minute
---
" Yes, I will wait."
---
" The
 lamb is n't really the business I came about, Mrs. Hurst.

---
In short, I was going."

---
" And were you indeed?"

---
D'ye know?"

---
me think
---
" Let," said Mrs. Hurst,....
---
You see, Farmer Oak
---
, you know
---
" That's unfortunate."
---
my only chance was in being
 the first comer...,
---
Well, there's no use in my waiting,
 for that
---
I came about:
---
so I'll take myself off
 home- along, Mrs. Hurst."

---
the runner drew nearer.
---
: hers
 was already deep, not, but from running.
"
---
as it appeared, from emotion,

---
" I have just called
---
" Yes- I know that

before the sun dries off the dew
---
" I did n't know

I should have come
 in from the garden instantly.

I ran--

 spot rising in each cheek

After that, do you think?

You speak like a lady-- all the parish
 notice it, and

 be.

May I call in the evening, or?

will you walk along

I do n't want

you to make- up
 your mind at once,"

if you'd rather not.

" No-- no-- I can not.

I do n't love you--

Then
 I'll ask you no more."

It may have been observed.

---
that there is no regula
 path for getting out of love as there is for getting in

Some people look upon marriage as a short cut that way,
 but.

Separation, is apt to idealise the removed object
 with others-- notably those whose affection, placid and
 regular as it may be flows deep and long.

George, the elder, exhibited
 an ebony- tipped nose, surrounded by a narrow margin
 of pink flesh, and a coat marked in random splotches
 approximating in colour to white and slaty grey; but
---
the
 grey, after years of sun and rain, had been scorched and
.
---
as if the blue component of the grey
 had faded,
---
In substance it had originally been
 hair, but
---
long contact with sheep seemed.

---
This dog had originally belonged to a shepherd of
 inferior morals and dreadful temper, and
---
the result was
.

---
Long experience had so precisely taught the animal the
 difference between such exclamations as" Come in!"
 and if a staggerer with the sheep
 crook was to be escaped.

On the further side of
 Norcombe Hill was a chalk- pit, from which chalk had
 been drawn for generations, and spread over adjacent
 farms.
---
Two hedges converged upon it in the form of
 a V, but without quite meeting.
---
The narrow opening
 left,,

---
which was immediately over the brow of the pit

was protected by a rough railing

Only one responded-- old George

It was a still, moist night.

assisted in waking by the abnormal reverberation of
 familiar music.

that only makes

 This exceptional ringing may be caused in two ways--
 by the rapid feeding of the sheep bearing the bell, as
 when the flock breaks into new pasture, which gives it
 an intermittent rapidity, or by the sheep starting off in
 a run, when the sound has a regular palpitation.
---
to be caused by the running of the flock with great
 velocity

These two hundred
 seemed.

-- a gap
 had been broken through it, and.

 of which a great deal grew in the plantation

They were not in the plantation.

the valleys and farthest hills resounded

 shore

 we have spoken

the younger dog standing against
 the sky-- dark and motionless as Napoleon at St.
 Helena

the rails were broken through, and

The dog came up,.

The ewes lay dead and dying

 representing in their condition just now at least two
 hundred more.

It was a second to remember another phase of the

The sheep were not insured.

THE FAIR-- THE JOURNEY-- THE FIRE


 TWO months passed away.
---
We are brought on to a
 day in February
---
labour suggests nothing
 worse than a wrestle with gravitation, and
---
pleasure
 nothing better than a renunciation of the same among
 these, carters and waggoners were distinguished by
 having a piece of whip- cord twisted round their hats
---
At one end of the street stood from two to three
 hundred blithe and hearty labourers waiting upon Chance
 -- all men of the stamp to whom;
 thatchers wore a fragment of woven straw
---
; shepherds
 held their sheep- crooks in their hands; and
---
thus the
 situation required was known to the hirers at a
 glance.

---
In the crowd was an athletic young fellow of some-
 what superior appearance to the rest--.
---
" I am looking for a place myself-- a bailiff's
---
Do
 Ye know of anybody who wants one?"

---
which had

---
more than it had taken away
---
there was
---
that indiffer-
 ence to fate
---
when it does not
---
And thus the abasement had been exaltation, and the
 loss gain.

---
In the morning a regiment of cavalry had left the
 town, and.
---
As the end of the
 day drew on, and
---
All the farmers seemed.

---
How long would it take you?"

---
the crook was made.

---
, the
 owner of which had a large rural connection.
---
This transaction having been completed
---
, it
 seemed.
---
that bailifs were most in demand
---
Dialogues
 followed, more or"

---
" Where do you come from
---
" That's a long way.

---
Who's farm
---
" were you upon last?"

---
This reply invariably operated like a rumour of
 cholera.
---
The inquiring farmer would edge away and
.
---
It is safer, and
 but.
---
that offers itself
---
that was required in the fair
---
It
 grew dusk.
---
who had never known
 moment's sorrow
---
that there was another
 fair at Shottsford the next day
---
" How far is Shottsford?"

---
It was.
---
This information was like coming
 from night into noon.

---
" How far is it to Weatherbury?"
" Five or six miles."

---
the place had,.
---
enough interest attaching
 to it
---
because it lay in the Weatherbury
 quarter
---
Moreover, the Weatherbury folk were by no
 means.
---
If report spoke
---
truly
 they were as hardy, merry, thriving, wicked a set as
 any in the whole county.
---
which had

---
The road stretched through water- meadows
---
traversed
 by little brooks
---
, whose quivering surfaces were braided
 along their centres, and
---
where the flow was more rapid
---
folded into creases at the sides;
 or,, the stream was.
---
which rode on in undisturbed
 serenity
---
On the higher levels the dead and dry carcasses
 of leaves tapped the ground.
---
as they bowled along helter-
 skelter upon the shoulders of the wind, and
---
little birds
 in the hedges were rustling their feathers and
---
drawn up under a great
 over- hanging tree by the roadside
---
The waggon, from its position, seemed.

---
which was heaped in the bottom
---
about half a truss  of hay
, it was quite empty
---
Inward melancholy it was impossible.
---
that the waggon
 was in motion
---
which would have been alarm
---
-- misfortune is a fine opiate to personal terror)

---
Charles's
 Wain was getting towards a right angle with the Pole
 star, and
---
that it must be about nine
 o'clock--
---
This small astronomical calculation was made without
 any positive effort, and.

---
Two figures were dimly visible in front,.

---
one of whom was driving
---
that this was the waggoner, and
---
it
 appeared.

---
A conversation was in progress,
---
which continued
 thus: --
"
---
these dandy cattle be as- proud as a lucifer
 in their insides."

---
This utterance was very shaky by nature, and more so
 by circumstance, the jolting of the waggon not being-
 without its effect upon the speaker's larynx.
---
"-- so' tis said here and
 there."

---
as I be
---
Tis said."

---
" And' a can play the peanner, so' tis said.
---
" D'ye tell o't!
---
There were, however, no
 ground for retaining such a supposition, for the waggon,

---
They were now apparently
 close upon Weatherbury and
---
the glow increased.
---
Something was on fire.

---
A rick- yard was the source of the fire.

---
It seemed.

---
as if the spot was
 unoccupied by a living soul
---
The fire was issuing from a long straw- stack, which
 was so far gone as to preclude a possibility of saving it.

---
A rick burns differently from a house.
---
As the wind
 blows the fire inwards
---
, the portion in flames completely
 disappears like melting sugar, and
---
the outline is lost
 to the eye.
---
However, a hay or a wheat- rick, well put
 together.

---
if
 it begins on the outside
---
This loosely
 put together, and
---
the flames darted into it with lightning
 swiftness.
---
It glowed on the windward side,.
---
Then a
 superincumbent bundle rolled down, with a whisking
 noise
---
; flames elongated, and bent themselves about
 with a quiet roar, but no crackle.
---
Banks of smoke
 went off horizontally at the back like passing clouds,
 and.
---
Individual straws in the foreground were
 consumed in a creeping movement of ruddy heat,
---
as
 if they were knots of red worms, and
---
above shone
 imaginary fiery faces, tongues hanging from lips, glaring
 eyes, and other impish forms
---
, from which at intervals
 sparks flew in clusters like birds from a nest
---
A scroll of smoke blew aside and

---
comparatively isolated, there was a regular
 connection between it and the remaining stacks of the
 group
---
A good master and a. bad
 servant is fire, fire!
---
-- I mane a bad servant and a good
 master O, Mark Clark--!
---
whose shadows danced
 merrily up and down, and not at all by their owners' movements.

---
timed by the jigging of the
 flames,
---
which casts its thoughts into the form of feeling
---
The corn stood on
 stone staddles, and
---
between these, tongues of yellow
 hue from the burning straw licked and.

---
If the fire once got under this stack
---
, all would be
.

---
A rick- cloth was brought, and
---
they hung it like a
 curtain across the channel.
---
The flames immediately
 ceased, and
.

---
The flames, now driven upwards, began.

---
" The ladder was against the straw- rick and.
---
" said a spectre- like form in the smoke.

---
which had

---
who had been on
 the waggon
---
The smoke at this corner was stifling, and

---
Clark, a nimble fellow, having been handed a bucket
 of water,
---
On the ground the groups of villagers were still
.
---
they could
---
which was not much
---
They were all
 tinged orange, and.
---
backed up by shadows of varying
 pattern
---
These two seemed.

---
that the horse might not become
 restive
---
, I
 declare!
---
" said the equestrian in a
 clear voice.

---
" Do n't any of the others know?"

---
" Nobody at all-- I've asked'em.
---
Quite a stranger,
 they say."

---
Do you think
---
the barn is safe
---
the barn is safe,
---
" Safe-now-- leastwise I think so.
---
If this rick had

---
gone the barn would have followed.' Tis-."

---
that have done the most good
---
" I wish.
---
The fire began, and
---
that the farmer wishes
---
Maryann stalked off towards the rick and.
---
Where is your master the farmer
---
that
 seemed
---
" A woman farmer?"
" Ay,' a b'lieve, and a rich one too!" said a by-
 stander.
---
who died suddenly
---
They say now
."

---
that she've business in every bank in Casterbridge, and
 thinks no more of playing pitch- and- toss sovereign than
 you and
---
I, do pitch- halfpenny-- not a bit in the world,
 shepherd
---
" said Mary-
 ann.
---
Do you happen, ma'am
---
Do you want a shepherd, ma'am
---
whether most to be amused at the singularity of
 the meeting, or
---
said one of the villagers,
 quietly.

---
Conviction breeds conviction.
---
" Ay, that' a is."
---
" said number four, fervidly.
---
All" was practical again now.
---
A summer eve and
 loneliness would have been necessary.

---
that this
 Ashtoreth of strange report was only a modification of
 Venus
---
The fire before them wasted away."
---
" you shall take a little refreshment after this
 extra work.
---
Will you come to the house?"

---
" We could knock in a bit and a drop a good deal
 freer, Miss
---
, if so be ye'd send it to Warren's Malthouse,"
 replied the spokesman.

---
the bailiff, finally," all is settled
---
, I
 think, about your coming, and
---
I am going home- along.

---
Can you get me a lodging
---
as
 a Christian edges past an offertory- plate not mean
---
If you follow on the road
---
till
 you come to Warren's Malthouse,
---
where they are all

---
" gone to have their snap of victuals, I daresay.
---
some of
'em will tell you of a place
---
The bailiff went up the hill, and
---
them fit for one
---
where several ancient trees grew
---
There was a wide margin of grass along here, and

---
which appeared
---
The noise
 was enough to disturb the motionless stranger, who
 started and.

---
The voice was unexpectedly attractive
---
; it was" the
 low and dulcet note suggestive of romance," common in
 descriptions, rare in experience.

---
" I'll thank you?"
---
if I'm in the way for
 Warren's Malthouse
---
It's at the bottom of the hill.
---
And
 do you know-- --"
---
" Do you know?"
---
how late they keep open
 the Buck's Head Inn
---
" I do n't know.
---
where the Buck's Head is, or anything
 about it
---
Do you think of going there to- night?"

---
There was
 no necessity for any continuance of speech, and
---
the fact
 more seemed.
---
which is noticeable in the ingenuous
---
when they
 are acting by stealth
---
" I am not.
---
I am the new shepherd--."

---
you seem almost a farmer by
 your ways."

---
You wo n't say
---
anything in the parish about having
 seen me here
---
, will you-- at least, not for a day or two
---
I wo n't if you wish me not to."
---
the other replied."I am
 rather poor, and
---
I do n't want." 
---
people to know anything
 about me
---
You ought
---
" I would advise' ee."

---
Would you mind?

---
I thank you much for what you have told me."

---
" I will go on."
---
Since
 you are not very well off
---
; adding hesitatingly,--", perhaps you would accept this
 trifle from me
---
It is only a shilling, but
---
it is all I have
 to spare."

---
" Yes, I will take it."
---
said the stranger, gratefully.

---
before the money could
 be passed
---
In feeling for
 each other's palm in the gloom, a minute incident occurred.

---
which told much
---
It was beating with a throb of tragic intensity.
---
" What is the matter?"

---
" But there is?"

---
me be a secret
---
Very well; I will.

CHAPTER VIII



 THE MALTHOUSE-- THE CHAT-- NEWS


 WARREN'S Malthouse was enclosed by an old wall
 inwrapped with ivy, and
---
though not much of the exterior
 was visible at this hour
---
, the character and purposes of
 the building were clearly.
---
enough shown by its outline
 upon the sky
---
an overhanging thatched
 roof sloped up to a point in the centre,
---
a mist was
---
There was
 no window in front; but
---
a square hole in the door was
.

---
through which red, comfortable
 rays now stretched out upon the ivied wall in front
---
Voices were.

---
This lifted
 a wooden latch, and
---
the door swung open.

---
The room inside was lighted only by the, ruddy glow
 from the kiln mouth, which shone over, the floor with
 the streaming, horizontality of the setting sun, and.
---
The stone- flag floor was worn into
 a path from the doorway to the kiln, and into undula-
 tions everywhere.
---
which seemed)
---
Several exclaimed meditatively, after this operation had
 been completed: --
"
---
" We thought, but."
---
we heard
---
a hand pawing about the
 door for the bobbin
---
" Come in, shepherd;
 sure ye be welcome,."

---
though we do n't know yer name
---
" Gabriel Oak, that's my name,."

---
The ancient maltster sitting in the midst turned up
 this--.

---
said the shepherd, placidly.

---
I did
---
And where be ye trading
 o't to now, shepherd?"

---
" I'm thinking of biding here."
---
" Knowed yer grandfather for years and years!"
 continued the maltster
---
as if the momentum previously imparted
 had been sufficient
---
, the words coming forth of their
 own accord.
" Ah-- and did you!"

---
that they were sure
---
However, my son
 William must have knowed
---
--
 did n't ye,
---
who manifested the peculiarity
 of possessing a cheerful soul in a gloomy body
---
I can mind Andrew.
---
" Ay-- the other day I and my youngest daughter,
 Liddy, were over at my grandson's christening."
---
" We were talking about this very family, and
."

---
when
 the use- money is gied away to the second- best poor
 folk
---
, you know,
---
I can mind the day

---
because they all had
---
Tis gape and
 swaller with us-- a drap of sommit, but not of much
 account." said the maltster,.
---
which were vermilion- red and by gazing
 into it for so many years
---
which was a
 two- handled tall mug standing in the ashes
---
it was rather furred with ex-
 traneous matter about the outside, especially in the
 crevices of the handles,
---
the innermost curves of which
 may not have seen daylight for several years by reason
 of this encrustation thereon--;
---
the cup was no worse for that,
.
---
It may be observed;.

---
that such a class of mug is

---
probably because its size makes

---
if the liquor was
 warm enough
---
" A clane cup for the shepherd." said the maltster
 commandingly.

---
" I never fuss about dirt in its pure
 state, and.
---
when I know
---
what sort it is
---
when there's so much work to be done in
 the world already
---
which is

---
occasioned by pulls at large mugs
---
" True, true; it ca n't be gainsaid!"
---
that
 mis'ess have sent
---
The cider will go down
 better with a bit of victuals.
---
Do n't ye chaw quite close,
 shepherd,
---
for I let, and.

---
the bacon fall in the road outside as
 I was bringing it along
---
There,' tis clane dirt; and we all know,
, and
---
what that is
---
as you say
---
your teeth quite meet
---
you wo n't feel
 the sandiness at all.
---
what can be
 done by contrivance
---
said the maltster.

---
Having at this moment reached the end of a wistful
 gaze into mid- air
---
, Henry did not refuse.
---
who laid it down
---
if any
 passing schoolmaster ventured to remark that the second
" e" was superfluous and old- fashioned
---
which
 had a great deal to do with personal character
---
who had passed the cup to Henery
---
Ther's plenty more
 in the barrel." said.
---
-- that I will,' tis my only doctor.
---
" Such a modest man!" said Jacob Smallbury.

---
" Why, ye've hardly had strength of eye enough to look
 in our young mis'ess's face, so I hear, Joseph?"

---
" Poor feller." said Mr. Clark.

---
that it was regarded as an
 interesting study
---
" I believe"

---
ye, Joseph Poorgrass, for we all know.
---
" And ye have suffered from it a long time,
."

---
we know
---
" Did ye ever go into the world,
 Joseph Poorgrass?"

---
it did n't cure me a morsel
---
I had; but
---
' twas no use-- I
 was just as- bad as ever after all.
---
that I be no worse
---
" True." said Jacob Smallbury,.
---
that ye might have been worse
---
even
 as you be,
---
ye see, shepherd,
---
"' Tis--' tis." said.
---
, did n't ye,
 Master Poorgrass?
---
that a true
 narrative, like time and tide, must run its course and

---
A owl in a tree happened
"
---
, you
 know
---
as owls do, shepherd
---
" No, no, now-- that's too much!"
---
" I did n't say sir.
---
I'll tike my oath
---
I did n't say" Joseph
 Poorgrass o' Weatherbury, sir.
---
what's right

---
" No, no; is right, and
---
I never said sir to the bird,."
---
-- that's every word and

---
I said,
---
I should
---
Joseph Poor-
 grass of Weatherbury,"  n't ha' said that if' t had n't been for Keeper
 Day's metheglin....
---
it
 ended
---
where it did
---
The question of which was
---
right being tacitly waived
 by the company
---
Ay, another time ye were lost by Lambing- Down Gate,

---
were n't ye, Joseph?"

---
" I was.".
"
---
as if there were some
 conditions too serious even for modesty to remember
 itself under,
---
this being one
---
Yes; that were the middle of the night, too.
---
The
 gate would not open,."

---
there was the Devil's hand in it
---
the cider, and a perception of the
 narrative capabilities of the experience alluded to.

---
" My heart died within me, that time; but
---
I kneeled
 down and and then the Ten Commandments, in
 earnest prayer.
---
said the Lord's Prayer, and then the Belie
 right through,
---
But no, the gate would n't open; and

---
then I went on with Dearly Beloved Brethren, and,
 and
---
thinks I
---
, this makes four, and' tis all I know out of
 book,
---
if this do n't do it, and
---
nothing will
---
when I got to Saying After Me
---
Well,, I
 rose from my knees and
---
the gate would open
 -- yes,
---
neighbours, the gate opened the same as ever."
  
---
A meditation on the obvious inference was indulged
 in by all, and.
  
---
which glowed like a desert in
 the tropics under a vertical sun,
---
" What sort of a place
 is this to live at, and
---
As I take it
---
" That's about the shape o't,' a b'lieve."
---
Did ye know en,
.
---
Did ye know' en,
 shepherd-- a bachelor- man?"
  
---
" I used.

I being

a
 respectable young fellow was allowed

as I liked
---
" Ay, ay, Jan Coggan; we know yer meaning."
  
---
" And so you see' twas beautiful ale, and."
---
I wished

---
as I could
---
And so I used, and then by the time I got there
---
salt fish afore
 going
---
I were as dry
 as a lime- basket-- so thorough dry!

that that ale would
 slip down -- ah,

as I
 used

You can mind, Jacob?

You used."

But for a wet of the better class, you begun

Not a single damn allowed; no,
 not a bare poor one, even at the most cheerful moment
 when all were blindest,."
  
---
though the good old word of
 sin thrown in here and there at such times is a great
 relief to a merry soul
---
" True." said the maltster.

unholy exclamations is a necessity of life."

 the sort would Charlotte allow

who found some
 difficulty in keeping the conversation in the desired
 channel

" I knew them a little."

said Jacob Smallbury;" but

they were townsfolk, and.
---
They've
 been dead for years.
---
" Well." said the maltster,

when they were

as I've been told

" Boundless love; I should n't have supposed it in the
 universe!"

 tailor really, worth scores of pounds.
---
" Oh, I thought!"

The maltster being rather short of breath

which had fallen among
 the ashes

that a happy Providence kept it from being any
 worse

when they called

till they could
 hardly stand upright

added Billy Smallbury.

Their daughter was not at all a pretty chile at that
 time

said Henery Fray.

" Well, yes; but the baily will have most to do with
 the business and ourselves.
---
Ah!" Henery gazed into
 the ashpit, and.

said Henery,.

that irony must cease
 at a certain point

" Between we two, man and man, I
 believe."

that I do so

Good faith, you do talk!

 people of one sort, and people of another, but that man

 grimly, and not in the best humour.
  
---
Shepherd would like--
---
" What may your age be, malter?"
  
---
when the importance of a subject is
---
that any mannerism must be tolerated
 in getting at it,"
---
Well, I do n't mind
---
the year I were

---
but perhaps I can reckon up the places I've
 lived at, and.
---
I bode at Upper Long-
 puddle across there"
---
till I were
 eleven.
---
I bode seven at Kingsbere"( nodding to the
 east)".
---
where I took to malting
---
I went therefrom to
 Norcombe, and
---
two- and- twenty years I was there turnip- hoeing and
 harvesting.
---
Ah, I knowed that old place, Norcombe,

---
" Old Twills
 would n't hire me for more than eleven months at a
 time,.
---
I was
---
Then I was three year at
 Mellstock, and
---
I've been here one- and- thirty year come
 Candlemas.
---
How much is that?"
  
---
" Hundred and seventeen." chuckled another old
 gentleman, given to mental arithmetic and little con-
 versation, who had hitherto sat unobserved in a corner.
  
---
" Well, then, that's my age."
---
said the maltster, em-
 phatically.
  
---
" Your turnip- hoeing
 were in the summer and your malting in the winter of
 the same years, and
---
ye do n't ought."
  " Chok' it all!
---
I lived through the summers,
---
did n't
 I?
---
That's my question.
---
I suppose?"
  
---
ye'll say
---
next I be
 no age at all
---
Sure we sha n't.
---
" Ye be a very old aged person, malter."
---
ye must
---
" True, true;, malter, wonderful," said the
 meeting unanimously.
  
---
While the cup was being examined
---
I seed
---
you blowing into a great flute by now at Caster-
 bridge?"
  
---
" You did.
---
" I've been
 in great trouble, neighbours, and.

---
shepherd and your time will come
 tired?"
  
---
have I heard since
 Christmas
---
" That I will.
---
such as I can do
---
ye shall have and."
  
---
who having no individuality worth
 mentioning
---
" I'd as lief- as that."
  
---
for us to
 have such a shepherd
---
We ought
---
" to feel full o' thanksgiving
; for' twould have been just as easy.
---
Yes, for our wives"
 and daughters' sakes we should feel real thanks."
  
---
that ye
 may be
---
if I may term it so
---
Ay, I can mind yer face now, shepherd."
---
said
 Henery Fray,.
---
Yes-- now I see' ee
---
I know'
---
I see play at Casterbridge, for yer mouth
---
that playing the flute should make
---
, the latter
 person jerking out, with the ghastly grimace required by
 the instrument, the chorus of" Dame Durden!
  "
---
I hope?"
---
" Ay, that ye be, shepard."
---
said the company.
  
---
good manners demanded,
---
, when I and my wife were married at Norcombe
 Church
---
" we were called the
 handsomest couple in the neighbourhood--
---
the old maltster, not pleased at finding
 himself left out of the subject everybody
 said so
---
if ye bain't altered now
---
said a voice
 with the vigour natural to the enunciation of a remark-
 ably evident truism.
---
, whose offensiveness and spiteful ways were

---
" Do n't ye play no more shepherd
---
" I must be moving and
---
when there's tunes
 going on I seem as if hung in wires.
---
If I thought
---
after
 I'd left
---
that music was still playing, and I not there
---
, I
 should be quite melancholy- like."
  
---
" What's yer hurry then, Laban?"
---
" You used."
  
---
Henery Fray was the first to follow.
---
who had offered
 him a lodging
---
A few minutes later, when the remaining
 ones were on their legs and about to depart
---
, Fray came
 back again in a hurry.
---
What's a- brewing, Henrey
---
I said so;
---
yes,
 I said so!"
  
---
" What, found out?"
  
---
" Stealing it is.
---
The news is,
---
all was
 safe,, and
---
the granary steps with half a
 a bushel of barley
---
You do
---
"-- you do, Henery."
  
---
my question is?"
  
---
, who's going
---
The question was such a profound one that Henery
 was obliged to drink there and then from the large
 cup till the bottom.
---
Have ye heard the news that's all over parish?"
  
---
they replied,.
  
---
" What a night of horrors!" murmured Joseph Poor-
 grass,.
---
" I've had the
 news- bell ringing in my left ear quite bad enough for a
 murder, and
---
I've seen a magpie all alone!"
  
---
They've been wanting, but
---
And they
 do n't know.
---
They would n't be so concerned."
  
---
Maryann d'think the beginning of a crowner's
 inquest
---
" O--' tis burned--'!"
---
tis burned
---
" No--' tis drowned!
---
" said Tall.
  
---
before we go to bed
---
They all hastened up the lane to the farmhouse,
.
---
There, as
 the others' footsteps died away
---
From the bedroom window above their heads Bath-
 sheba's head and shoulders, robed in mystic white, were

---
" Tomorrow morning I wish.
---
Do it quietly; there is
 no reason for alarm as yet.
---
whilst
 we were all at the fire
---
I beg yer pardon, but
---
" I do n't know."
---
" I've never heard of any such thing, ma'am.
---
" said
 two or three.
  
---
" It is hardly likely, either."
---
which gives me serious alarm
---
you mean
---
, I think,
---
though I could n't see
 very well
---
" said a female voice from another window,
.
---
which seemed that of Maryann
---
Hers lives in Casterbridge, and

---
I believe."
  
---
" Perhaps I might be able to find out if I went to
 Casterbridge barracks.
---
" said William Smallbury.
  
---
" Very well;, mind
 you go there and.
---
I feel more responsible than I should.
---
And then there's this disgraceful affair of the bailiff--
 but
---
that
 it seemed
---
as I told you
---
" Ay, ay, mistress; we will.
---
" they replied, and.
  
---
It is
 rarely but
---
that the pleasures of the imagination will compen-
,
---
which told at a
 glance
---
of' a proportion that, as is so frequently the case, it had once
 been the memorial hall upon a small estate around it,

---
which com-

---
Fluted pilasters, worked from the solid stone,

---
the chimneys
 were panelled or columnar
---
decorated its front, and above the roof, some coped gables with
 finials and like features still retaining traces of their
 Gothic extraction.
---
Soft Brown mosses, like faded
 velveteen,.
---
tufts of the houseleek or sengreen sprouted from the
 eaves of the low surrounding buildings
---
A gravel walk
 leading from the door to the road in front was encrusted
 at the sides with more moss
---
-- here it was a silver- green
 variety,.
---
the nut- brown of the gravel being visible to the
 width of only a foot or two in the centre
---
This circum-
 stance, and the generally sleepy air of the whole prospect
 here, together with the animated and contrasting state
 of the reverse facade, suggested to the imagination that
 on the adaptation of the building for farming purposes
 the vital principle' of the house had turned round inside
 its body to face the other way.
---
Reversals of this kind,
 strange deformities, tremendous paralyses, are often seen
.
  
---
to be inflicted by trade upon edifices--
---
which were

---
either individual
 or in the aggregate as streets and towns-- originally planned for pleasure alone
---
Lively voices were heard this morning in the upper
 rooms
---
, the handrail as
 stout as a parapet- top, and the stairs themselves con-
.
---
Going up, the floors above were found
,
---
to have a very irregular surface rising to ridges, sinking
 into valley; and being just then uncarpeted, the face
 of the boards was seen.
  
---
innumerable
 the opening and shutting of every door a tremble
 followed every bustling movement, and
---
a creak accom-
 panied a walker about the house like a spirit,
---
from which the conversation proceeded,

---
remnants from the house-
 hold stores of the late occupier
---
was amply made up
 for by perfection  of hue,
---
which at this winter- time was
 the softened ruddiness on a surface of high rotundity
 and,
---
like the presentations of those great colourists, it
 was a face which kept well back from the boundary
 between comeliness and the ideal
---
occa-
 sionally showed some earnestness, which consisted half
 of genuine feeling, and half of mannerliness superadded
 by way of duty.
  
---
Through a partly- opened door the noise of a scrubbing-
 brush led up to the charwoman, Maryann Money, a person
 who for a face had a circular disc, furrowed less by age
 than by long gazes of perplexity at distant objects.
---
your scrubbing a moment
---
" I hear something."
  
---
Maryann suspended the brush.
  
---
The tramp of a horse was apparent,.
---
The paces slackened,.
---
what was most unusual
---
The door was
 tapped with the end of a crop or stick.
  
---
con-
 tinued by aspect instead of narrative
---
Bath-
 sheba continued.
  
---
" Maryann, you go!"
---
The argument was unanswerable after a glance at
 Maryann.
  "."
---
Liddy-- you must
---
they were sorting
---
The door opened, and
---
a deep voice said--
  "?"
  
---
I'll see, sir.
---
" Dear, what a thirtover place this world is!"
---
who
 had a voice for each class of remark
---
; who could toss a pancake or twirl
 a mop with the accuracy of pure mathematics, and

---
who at this moment showed hands shaggy with frag-
 ments of dough and arms encrusted with flour)
---
" I
 am never up to my elbows, Miss, in making a pudding
 but
---
one of two things do happen-- either my nose must
 needs begin, and
---
Whatever shall I do?"
  
---
Not- at- homes were
---
you're a fright
 with dust
---
" Yes-- that sounds very well."
---
-- that will do
---
is quite
 a object-- that's why' tis
---
" Oh, very well." said the deep voice."
---
I wanted
---
but we may know to- night.
---
The horse's tramp then recommenced and
---
the door closed.
  
---
" A gentleman- farmer at Little Weatherbury."
  " Married?"
  " No, miss."
  
---
" Forty, I should say-- very handsome--."
  
---
" What a bother this dusting is! 
---
I am always in
 some unfortunate plight or other complainingly.
---
the money might as well have been thrown out of the
 window
---
This child was one of the Coggans who,
 with the Smallburys, were as common among the
 families of this district as the Avons and Derwents
 among our rivers.
---
I've got a pen- nee!
---
Well-- who gave it you, Teddy
---
Where are you going, my little man
---
I said," Yes."
  
---
What did you say that for?"
  
---
" What a pucker everything is in!"
---
when the child had gone
---
You ought!
---
to be married by this time, and
---
"
  " Ay, mistress-- so I did.
---
who wo n't have me
---
the rich men,
 I stand as a pelicon in the wilderness!"
  
---
" Did anybody ever want?"
---
you miss
---
when they were again alone
---
Lots of
" em, i daresay.?"
 
---
How nice it must seem!
---
, when most of us
 are glad to say,
---
I seem
---
I hear it.
"
---
No, sir-- I'm your better." or
---
" Kiss my foot, sir; my
 face is for mouths of consequence."
---
Do you now?"
  
---
" Of course not-- what footsteps are those I hear?"
  
---
which was now getting low- toned and dim with
 the earliest films of night
---
The whole string of trailing
 individuals advanced in the completest balance of inten-
 tion, like the remarkable creatures known as Chain
 Salpae, which, distinctly organized in other respects, have
 one will common to a whole family.
---
Some were, as
 usual, in snow- white smock- frocks of Russia duck, and

---
some in whitey- brown ones of drabbet-- marked on the
 wrists, breasts, backs, and sleeves with honeycomb- work.

---
The Philistines be upon us."
---
till I am dressed
---
I have
 two matters to speak of
---
The first is."
  
---
that the bailiff is
, and
---
that I have formed a resolu-
 tion to have no bailiff at all, but to manage everything
 with my own head and hands
---
" The next matter is
---
" Have you done anything?"
  
---
" said Jacob Smallbury,' and

---
we found nothing."
  
---
And the new shepherd have been to Buck's Head,
 by Yalbury,, but."
---
said Laban Tall.
  "
---
Hasn't William Smallbury been to Casterbridge?"
  
---
It wants a quarter to six at present."
---
" I daresay.

---
are you there?
---
" Yes, sir-- ma'am I mane."
---
the person addressed
---
" And what are you?"
  
---
In the eye of other people
 -- well, I do n't say it; though public thought will out."
  
---
" What do you do on the farm?"
  
---
I do do
---
in seed time I
 shoots the rooks and sparrows, and."
  
---
a good halfpenny
 where' twas a bad one, sir-- ma'am I mane."
  
---
as I am a new comer
---
" How much do I owe you-- that man in the corner--
"
---
what's your name?
---
" Matthew Moon, ma'am." said a singular framework of
 clothes with nothing of any consequence inside them,
 which advanced with the toes in no definite direction
 forwards, but turned in or out as they chanced to swing.
  
---
Matthew Mark, did you say?
---
-- speak out-- I shall
 not hurt you.
---
"" inquired the young farmer, kindly.
  "
---
Matthew Moon mem" said.
  
---
" Ten and twopence halfpenny
 is the sum put down to you
---
, I see?"
  
---
said Matthew, as the rustle of wind
 among dead leaves.
  
---
" Here it is and ten shillings.
---
, I hear.
---
How come you to
 leave your last farm?"
  
---
" A can cuss,
 mem, as well as you or I, but."
  "
---
Here we be,' a b'lieve."
---
" What have you been doing?"
  
---
when they
 go upon your seeds and
---
" Yes-- I see.
---
Henery slinking off to a corner
---
Laban Tall, you'll stay on working
 for me?"
  
---
that pays me well
---
" Oh, you are."
---
" Well, Laban, will
 you stay on?"
  
---
", I suppose."
  
---
The names remaining were called in the same
 manner.
  
---
Now I think.
---
I have done with you
---
" Has William Smallbury returned?"
  
---
suggested Henery Fray,.
  
---
Henery said,
" and?"
---
who
 had just appeared on the scene
---
No, I do n't mind that.
---
you see
---
" It is rather unfortunate."
  
---
However, we soften it down as much as we
 can, and.
---
it shows."
  
---
how
 the sins of the parents are visited upon the children,
 mem
---
when the persons involved in
 the given misfortune do not belong to your own family
---
And you quite understand your duties?
---
I mean
---
" Quite well, I thank you Miss Everdene."
---
If I do n't, I'll
 inquire.
---
Certainly nobody without
 previous information would have dreamt.
---
The
 case is not unexampled in high places.
---
Footsteps were heard in the passage,.

---
" Here's Billy Smallbury."

---
I should have been sooner.
---
if it
 had n't been for the weather
---
" Come at last, is it?"
---
said Henery.

---
" I'll tell ye all particulars.
---
When I got
---
to Caster,
 bridge Barracks, they said,"."

---
The Eleventh Dragoon-
 Guards be gone away, and
---
new troops have come
---
The Eleventh left last week for Melchester and onwards.

---
The Route came from Government like a thief in the
 night,
---
afore the Eleventh knew
 it almost
---
, they were on the march.
---
They passed near
 here."

---
I saw,
---
them go
---
," they pranced down the
 street playing" The Girl I Left
---
" so' tis
 said, in glorious notes of triumph.
---
there was not a dry eye throughout
 the town among the public- house people and the name-
 less women!"

---
" But they're not gone to any war?"

---
; but they be gone.
---
who may
---
which is
---
And
 so I said to myself,.
---
There, ma'am,
 that's it in black and white."

---
Well, we are not likely to know more to- night, at
 any rate."
---
But one of you had
---
" Now mind, you have a mistress instead of a master
 I do n't yet know my powers or my talents in farming
---
;
 but I shall do my best, and
---
if you serve me well
---
, so
 shall I serve you.
---
( if there are any such
---
I hope not)
---
" Excellent well said.
---
" I shall be up
---
before you are awake
---
"
; I shall be
 afield; and
---
before you are up
---
I shall have breakfasted
.
---
before you are afield
---
In short, I shall astonish you all.

---
"
 Then this small- thesmothete stepped from the table,
 and.
---
the door was closed.

CHAPTER XI



 OUTSIDE THE BARRACKS-- SNOW-- A MEETING


 FOR dreariness nothing could surpass a prospect in the
 outskirts of a certain town and military station, many
 miles north of Weatherbury, at a later hour on this
 same snowy evening--
---
if that may be called a prospect
 of which
---
the chief constituent was darkness.

---
It was a night:
 when, with impressible persons, love becomes solicitous-
 ness, hope sinks to misgiving, and faith to hope:  when
 the exercise of memory does not stir feelings of regret
 at opportunities for ambition that have been passed by,
 and anticipation does not prompt to enterprise.

---
when sorrow may come to the
 brightest without causing any great sense of incongruity
---
The scene was a public path, bordered on the left
 hand by a river,
---
behind which rose a high wall.
---
The changes of the seasons are less obtrusive on
 spots of this kind than amid woodland scenery.
---
Still,
 to a close observer, they are just as perceptible
---
; the
 difference is.
---
that their media of manifestation are less
 trite and familiar than such well- known ones as the
 bursting of the buds or the fall of the leaf
---
Many are
 not so stealthy and gradual.
---
as we may be apt to
 imagine in considering the general torpidity of a moor
 or waste
---
This climax of the series had been reached to- night on
 the aforesaid moor, and
---
for the first time in the season
 its irregularities were forms without features; suggestive
 of anything, proclaiming nothing, and without more
 character than that of being the limit of something
 else-- the lowest layer of a firmament of snow.
---
The vast
 arch of cloud above was strangely low, and
---
as
 it were the roof of a large dark cavern,
---
that
 the snow lining the heavens and that encrusting the
 earth would soon unite into one mass without any
 intervening stratum of air at all
---
We turn our attention to the left- hand characteristics;
.
---
which were flatness in respect of the river, verticality
 in respect of the wall behind it, and darkness as to
 both
---
These features made up the mass.
---
If anything
 could be darker than the sky
---
, it was the wall, and.
---
if any
 thing could be gloomier than the wall it was the river
 beneath
---
The indistinct summit of the facade was

---
pronged by chimneys here and there, and
 upon its face
---
Below,
 down to the water's edge, the flat was unbroken by
 hole or projection.

---
An indescribable succession of dull blows, perplexing
 in their regularity, sent their sound- with difficulty
 through the fluffy atmosphere.
---
It was a neighbouring
 clock striking ten
---
The bell was in the open air, and
.

---
About this hour the snow abated
---
:  ten flakes fell

---
where twenty had fallen
---
, then one had the room of
 ten.
---
moved by the brink of
 the river
---
By its outline upon the colourless background, a close
 observer might have seen.
---
that it was small
---
This was
 all that was positively discoverable,.

---
though it seemed
 human
---
The shape went slowly along, but
---
At this time some words
 were spoken aloud: --
" One.
---
It was evident now that
 the windows high in the wall were being counted.

---
The word" Five" represented the fifth window from
 the end of the wall.

---
Here the spot stopped, and.
---
The
 figure was stooping.
---
Then a morsel of snow flew
 across the river towards the fifth window.
---
It smacked
 against the wall at a point several yards from its mark.

---
who had ever seen bird
---
Another attempt, and another; till by degrees the
 wall must have become
---
At last one fragment struck the fifth
 window.

---
The river would have been
---
; seen by day
---
which races middle and sides
 with the same gliding precision
---
to be of
 that deep smooth sort, any irregularities of
 speed being immediately corrected by a small whirl-
 pool.
---
The window was struck again in the same manner.

---
Then a noise was heard,.
---
apparently produced by
 the opening of the window
---
This was followed by a
 voice from the same quarter.

---
The tones were masculine, and not those of surprise.

---
The high wall being that of a barrack, and
---
assigna-
 tions and communications had probably been made
 across the river before tonight.

---
"" said the blurred spot in the
 snow, tremulously.

---
This person was so much like a mere shade upon
 the earth, and
---
the other speaker so much a part of
 the building, that one would have said.

---
the wall was

---
" O, Frank-- do n't you know me?"
---
said the spot.

---
The dialogue went on:

---
" How did you come here?"

---
" I asked.
---
which was your window
---
" I did not expect you to- night.
---
Indeed, I did not
 think.
---
you would come at all
---
It was a wonder.
---
you
 found me here
---
I am orderly to- morrow."

---
" You said."

---
I was
---
" Well-- I said."

---
that you might
---
" Yes, I mean.
---
that I might
---
You are glad to see me,
 Frank?"

---
"
" Can you-- come to me!"

---
The bugle has sounded,
---
the
 barrack gates are, and
---
I have no leave.
---
We are
 all of us as good as in the county gaol till to- morrow
 morning."

---
" Then I sha n't see you till then!"
---
The words- were
 in a faltering tone of disappointment.

---
" How did you get here from Weatherbury?"

---
" I walked-- some part of the way-- the rest by the
 carriers."

---
" I am surprised."

---
Frank, when will it be?"

---
" That you promised."

---
O You do!
---
It weighs me
 to the earth.
---
It makes."

---
me say
---
what ought
---
" Never mind-- say it."

---
, must I?
---
" O-- it is,?"

---
we be
---
" Oh, I" see.
---
Well--  you have."

---
" I have money.
---
Will it be by banns or license?"

---
" Banns, I should think."
"
---
And we live in two parishes."

---
" Do we?
---
" My lodgings are in St. Mary's, and
---
this is not.
---
So
 they will have."

---
" Is that the law?"

---
O Frank-- you think!
---
me forward, I am
 afraid
---
will you--
---
for I love you so.

---
And you said!
---
lots of times you would marry me, and
 and
---
-- I-- I-- I-- --"
  " Do n't cry, now
---
It is foolish.
---
If i said so,
---
of
 course I will."

---
" And shall I put up the banns in my parish, and
---
will
 you in yours?
---
We'll settle in a few days."

---
" You have the permission of the officers?"
" No, not yet."

---
" O-- how is it?
---
You said."

---
you almost had
---
before
 you left Casterbridge
---
" The fact is.
---
, I forgot
---
I'll go away now.
---
Will you**
---
" Yes-- yes-- it is.
---
It was wrong of me.

---
I'll go away now.
---
Will you come and?
---
I do n't like.
---
they
 think me one."

---
I'll come to you, my dean Good- night."

---
" Good- night, Frank-- good- night!"
 And the noise was again heard of a window closing

---
The little spot moved away.
---
An expostulation
 followed, but and
---
it was indistinct;
---
it became lost amid
 a low peal of laughter, which was hardly distinguishable

 was flung upon the floor, an issue of events perfectly
 well known to half- a- dozen acute town- bred fowls which
 had as usual crept into the building unobserved, and
 waited the fulfilment of their anticipations with a high-
 stretched neck and oblique eye

IT was Sunday afternoon in the farmhouse, on the
 thirteenth of February.
---
The mouldy pile was dreary
 in winter- time
---
before the candles were lighted and

the
 shutters closed

; the atmosphere of the place seemed
 as old as the walls

; every nook behind the furniture
 had a temperature of its own, for the fire and

which was an old one
 in other annals

it was n't Sunday

What's

" right week days is right Sundays."

which was a proof in itself
---
The book was opened-- the leaves, drab with age,
"
 fingers" of unpractised readers in former days, where they
 were moved along under the line as an aid to the vision.

; the book turned round;

" Who did you try?

" I shall not tell you."

, miss?"Liddy continued,.

---
" I know it."

---
Certainly I did not, I tell you."

This move was unexpected, and.

But everybody else was noticing you; and

it was odd

" Dear me-- I had nearly forgotten the valentine
 I bought yesterday.

Valentine! who for, miss?
---
Liddy, you may as well bring me
 my desk and

I'll direct it at once."

A large red seal was duly affixed.

CHAPTER XIV



 EFFECT OF THE LETTER-- SUNRISE


 AT dusk, on the evening of St. Valentine's Day, Bold-
 wood sat down to supper as usual, by a beaming fire
 of aged logs.
---
surmounted by a spread eagle
---
Here the bachelor's gaze was continually fastening
 itself,; and."

---
The pert injunction was like those crystal substances
 which, colourless themselves, assume the tone of objects
 about them.
---
that, was not grave
---
where everything was extraneous,
 and
---
Sunday
 lasting
---
the letter and its dictum changed"
 their tenor from the thoughtlessness of their origin to
 a deep solemnity,
---
The disturbance was as the first floating
 weed to Columbus--.

---
The letter must have had an origin and a motive.

---
That the latter was of the smallest magnitude com-
 patible with its existence at all,
---
It is foreign to a
 mystified condition of mind to realize of the mystifier
 that the processes of approving a course suggested by
 circumstance, and of striking out a course from inner
 impulse.
---
The vast
 difference between starting a train of events, and direct-
 ing into a particular groove a series already started,.

---
confounded by the
 issue
---
that caused
---
which had
 a deliberate motive
---
The mysterious influences of night invested the writing
 with the presence of the unknown writer.
---
as the pen went on
---
had curved itself to a
 certain expression-- the corners had
 moved with all their natural tremulousness: ?

---
The vision of as a supplement to
 the words written, had no individuality.
---
The moon shone to- night, and
---
its light was not of
 a customary kind.
---
the pale sheen had.

---
which snow gives
---
where
 shadows had used
---
Nothing more was there.
---
The solemn and reserved yeoman again closed the
 letter, and.
---
Then the dawn drew on.
---
The full power of the
 clear heaven was not equal to that of a cloudy sky at
 noon,.
---
It was one of the usual slow sunrises of this time of
 the year, and
---
the sky, pure violet in the zenith, was
 leaden to the northward, and murky to the east, where,
 over the snowy down or ewe- lease on Weatherbury
 Upper Farm, and apparently resting upon the ridge, the
 only half of the sun yet visible burnt rayless, like a red
 and flameless fire shining over a white hearthstone.

---
The whole effect resembled a sunset.

---
as childhood
 resembles age
---
In other directions, the fields and sky were so much
 of one colour by the snow,.
---
that it was difficult in a
 hasty glance
---
the horizon occurred;
 and
---
in general there was here, too,
---
which attends
 the prospect
---
when the garish brightness commonly in
 the sky is found on the earth
---
that before- mentioned
 preternatural inversion of light and shade, and the shades of earth
 are in the sky
---
Over the west hung the wasting moon,
 now dull and greenish- yellow, like tarnished brass.

---
how the frost had

---
- h the polish of marble;
 how, in some portions of the slope, withered.
---
grass- bents,
 encased in icicles, bristled through the smooth wan
 coverlet in the twisted and curved shapes of old
 Venetian glass; and
---
which had hopped over the snow
---
whilst it lay in the
 state of a soft fleece
---
how the footprints of a few birds,
, were now frozen to a short perma-
 nency
---
It was
 the mail- cart-- a crazy, two- wheeled vehicle, hardly
 heavy enough to resist a puff of wind.
---
The driver held
 out a letter.
---
that precedent will
 repeat itself
---
I do n't think."
---
it is for you, sir
---
Though there is no name

---
I think."

---
it is for your shepherd
---
" Oh-- what a mistake!-- it is not mine.
---
Nor is it
 for my shepherd.
---
" You had
."

---
I opened
 it in mistake
---
At this moment, on the ridge, up against the blazing
 sky, a figure was visible, like the black snuff in the
 midst of a candle- flame.
---
Then it moved and.
---
which were riddled by the same
 rays
---
A small figure on all fours followed behind.
---
To Boldwood it was now no longer merely a letter to
 I another man.
---
It was an opportunity.
---
The glow stretched down in this direction
 now, and
---
whither the shepherd was apparently bent
---
CHAPTER XV



 THE scarlet and orange light outside the malthouse did
 not penetrate to its interior, which was, as usual, lighted
 by a rival glow of similar hue, radiating from the hearth.

---
This was

---
which is performed by
 placing a slice of bread upon the table
---
when the severed lamp is impaled on the
 knife
---
The maltster's lack of teeth appeared.
---
that toothlessness was felt
---
as a hyperbolic curve
 approaches a straight line
---
till it was doubtful
---
for the
 benefit of whomsoever should call,
---
for Warren's was a
 sort of clubhouse
---
" I say."
---
, says I
---
, we get a fine day, and
---
then down
 comes a snapper at night
---
which
 had been opened the previous moment
---
The form of
 Henery Fray advanced to the fire,.
---
The speech
 and entry had not seemed,.
---
Henery appeared in a drab kerseymere great- coat,
.

---
the
 latter being visible to the distance of about a foot below
 the coat- tails,
---
you got
---
which, when used to the style of
 dress, looked natural enough, and even ornamental-- it
 certainly was comfortable
---
which showed
---
that they had
 just come from the cart- horse stables, where they had
 been busily engaged since four o'clock that morning
---
" the
 maltster inquired.

---
This was recognized by all as the conclusion of some
 gloomy speech which had been expressed in thought
 alone during the shake of the head
---
that they would be required for use again
---
" All will be ruined, and ourselves too, or
---
there's no
 meat in gentlemen's houses!
---
" said Mark Clark.

---
" A headstrong maid, that's-- and.
---
Pride and vanity have ruined
 many a cobbler's dog.
---
True, Henery, you do
---
, I've heard ye.
---
Do ye foller me?"

---
" I do: but
---
no baily-- I deserved that place."
---
wailed
 Henery,."
---
There,' twas
---
, I
 suppose.
---
Your lot is your lot, and but."

---
Scripture is nothing;

---
if you do good
---
for you do n't get
---
" No, no; I do n't agree with'ee there."
---
said Mark
 Clark.
---
God's a perfect gentleman in that respect."

---
as a sort of entr'acte
 Henery turned and
---
which the
 increase of daylight rendered no longer necessary even
 in the malthouse
---
" I wonder
---
they d'call
 it?"
---
said the maltster."
---
Liddy saith she've a new one."

---
She've bought all but everything new.

---
There's heavy chairs for the stout, weak and wiry ones
 for the slender
---
said Mr. Clark.
---
firm loud tread was now heard stamping outside
---
;
 the door was opened about six inches, and somebody on
 the other side exclaimed--
" Neighbours
---
said the conclave.

---
The door was flung back.
---
till it kicked the wall and

---
the dog George, to fetch from Norcombe, stalked
 solemnly behind.

---
,
 if I mid say it
---
Terrible trying
---
" I've been wet through
 twice a- day, either in snow or rain, this last fortnight.

---
Cainy and I haven't tined our eyes to- night."

---
" A good few twins, too, I hear?"

---
We sha n't have done by Lady Day."

---
I'll follow you soon."

---
them round the fire
---
We've no lambing- hut here,.
---
as I used
---
If' twasn't for your place
 here, malter, I do n't know!
---
what I should do
---
And how is it with you to- day, malter?"

---
" Ay-- I understand."

---
And how was the old place at Norcombe,
?
---
when ye went for your dog
---
I should like; but faith
---
, I should n't" know a soul
 there now."

---
" I suppose.'
---
you would n't
---
Tis altered very much."

---
Is it true
---
that Dicky Hill's wooden cider- house is

---
" pulled down?"

---
and Tompkins's old apple- tree is rooted and no help from
 other trees."

---
that
 used;
---
" Rooted?-- you do n't say it!
---
we
 live in-- stirring times.
---
And you can mind the old well that used to be in
 the middle of the place?
---
That's turned into a solid
 iron pump with a large stone trough, and all complete."

---
how the face of nations alter, and

---
what we live
---
They've been talking but now of the mis'ess's
 strange doings."

---
said Mark Clark;" but

---
I say,.
---
should n't I like
---
" Mark." said!

---
Gabriel, sternly," now you mind this
---
I do n't allow it.
---
Do
 you hear?"

---
" With all my heart, as I've got no chance."
---
replied
 Mr. Clark, cordially.

---
" I suppose?"
---
" No, no-- not a word I--' tis a real joyful thing, that's."
---
what I say
---
Matthew just said-- --"
"
---
you been saying
---
Why ye know
---
I would n't harm a worm-- no,
 not one underground worm?
---
" said Matthew Moon,
.

---
" Well, somebody has-- and."

---
" That's my fist."
---
that their eyes all thoroughly took in the
 idea of fistiness
---
that I hear
---
I'm a Dutchman."

---
All earnestly expressed by their features, but
---
that their
 minds did not wander to Holland for a moment on
 account of this statement
---
which gave rise to the figure;
---
Mark
 Clark cried" Hear,
---
were deploring the
 difference and hear; just what I should ha' said."

---
The dog George looked up at the same time after the
 shepherd's menace, and
---
" Now, do n't ye take on so, shepherd, and!"

---
said Henery, with a deprecating peacefulness equal to
 anything of the kind in Christianity.

---
We hear.
---
"' Tis a great
 thing to be clever, I'm sure."
---
;
" we wish?"
" Ay, that we do, sure
---
we were, do n't we, neighbours
---
" Who's been telling you?"
---
I'm clever
---
' Tis blowed about from pillar quite common
---
" to post,"
 said Matthew.
---
" We hear."

---
that ye can tell the time as
 well by the stars as we can by the sun and moon,
 shepherd
---
Yes, I can do a little that way.
---
before you came, and
---
' a
 could never mind
---
And so
 you used, like this
---
to do'em the wrong way, did n't ye,
 Joseph?"
---
" And how Farmer James would cuss, and
---
" Ay--' a would.
---
, you see,

---
" But I was n't so much to blame, for them J's and E's be
 such trying sons o' witches for the memory to mind
 whether they face backward or forward; and
---
I always
 had such a forgetful memory, too."

---
that it
 should be no worse, and
---
I feel my thanks.
---
I do n't mind.
---
that I expected it
---
Indeed, I hoped for the place.
---
The genial warmth of the fire now began.
---
that they were born
---
which were not
---
they
 acquired with astonishing aptitude
---
ye have the skins of the
 dead lambs
---
, I hear?"
---
" I do n't have them.
---
Ye be
---
" I think."

---
which the deprivation of lamb skins
 could hardly have caused
---
Before any further remark had been added
---
a shade
 darkened the door, and
---
Oak, I thought."
---
you were here
---
" I
 met the mail- cart ten minutes ago, and
---
a letter was put
 into my hand,.
---
which I opened without reading the
 address
---
I believe.
---
it is yours
---
You must excuse the
 accident please."

---
whose contents the whole parish would not have

---
,-- I do not know your name, but
---
l think
.
---
these few lines will reach you,
---
which I wrote
---
the night I left Weatherbury in a
 reckless way
---
I also return the money I owe you, which
 you will excuse my not keeping as a gift.
---
All has ended
 well, and
---
I know,
---
" I should be.

---
if you would keep the
 contents of this letter a secret for the present, dear friend
---
We mean.
---
The sergeant grew up in Weatherbury.
---
" I am, your sincere well- wisher,
" FANNY ROBIN
---
Have you read it, Mr. Boldwood?
---
if not, you had.
---
I know."

---
I see."

---
" H'm-- I'm afraid not one to build much hope upon
 in such a case as this."
---
the farmer murmured,".
---
it seems.
---
soon after an infant was
 horn; and
---
while money was forthcoming
---
all went on
 well.
---
I have much doubt
---
The door was.

---
Oak, sternly," why will you
 run so fast and
---
I'm always telling
 you of it."

---
" Oh-- I-- a puff of mee breath-- went-- the-- wrong
 way, please, Mister Oak, and!"

---
" Well--  what have you come for?"

---
I've run."
---
" to tell ye said the junior shepherd,
".
---
that you must come directly'
---
Two more ewes
 have twinned
---
what's the matter,
---
" Oh, that's it."
---
you shall
 smell a large plum pudding some day as a treat.
---
before we go
---
we'll mark
 this lot and."

---
vanished with them in the direction of
 the lambing field hard by--
---
their frames being now in a
 sleek and hopeful state,
---
in which the fold was constructed
---
A letter was revealed-- Bath-
 sheba's.

---
I was going.
---
if you know
---
whose writing this is
---
The letter could of course
 be no other than anonymous, or
---
the inquiry would not
 have been necessary.

---
are always ready with
---
their" Is it I?" in preference to
 objective reasoning.
"
---
The question was perfectly fair.
---
" You know
---
it is always expected
---
that
 privy inquiries will be made: 
---
that's.
---
where the-- fun
 lies
---
" it could
 not have been uttered with a more constrained and
 restless countenance."

---
They were about to
 disperse,.

---
when a smart footstep, entering the porch and
 coming up the central passage, arrested their attention
---
The step echoed with a ring unusual in a church
---
; it
 was the clink of spurs.
---
Everybody looked.
---
The officiating curate, perceived the new- comer, and.
---
they also went up the chancel steps.

---
The majority again sat down.

---
There was a creaking of machinery behind, and

---
some of the young ones turned their heads.
---
From the
 interior face of the west wall of the tower projected a
 little canopy with a quarter- jack and small bell beneath
 it, the automaton being driven by the same clock
 machinery that struck the large bell in the tower.
---
Be-
 tween the tower and the church was a close screen, the
 door of which.
---
At present, how-
 ever, the door was open, and the egress of the jack, the
 blows on the bell, and the mannikin's retreat into.the
 nook again, were visible to many, and audible through-
 out the church.

---
The jack had struck half- past eleven.

---
The young sergeant stood still with the abnormal
 rigidity of the old pillars around.
---
The silence grew and
---
nobody else appeared, and.
---
not a
 soul moved
---
The rattle of the quarter- jack again from
 its niche, its blows for three- quarters, its fussy retreat,
 were almost painfully abrupt, and.

---
many of the
 congregation to start palpably
---
" I wonder!"
---
which betrays a
 nervous suspense
---
At length there was a titter.
---
But
 the soldier never moved.
---
The clock ticked on.
---
titters and giggling became more
 frequent.
---
Then came a dead silence.
---
Every one was

---
Some persons may have noticed
 how extraordinarily the striking of quarters.
---
It was hardly credible that
 the jack had not got wrong with the minutes when the
 rattle began again
---
, the puppet emerged, and.
---
the four
 quarters were struck fitfully as before:
---
One could al-

---
that there was a malicious leer upon
 the hideous creature's face, and a mischievous delight
 in its twitchings
---
there was no
 giggle this time.

---
The clergyman glided into the vestry, and
---
the clerk
 vanished.
---
The sergeant had not yet turned
---
Two bowed and
---
toothless old
 almsmen then looked at each other and; but
---
the sound had a strange weird
 effect in that place.

---
Opposite to the church was a paved square, around
 which several overhanging wood buildings of old time
 cast a picturesque shade.
---
which had been one of intense anxiety
---
" O, Frank-- I made a mistake!
---
-- I thought eleven to a minute as you said.
.
---
that
 church with the spire was All Saints', and
---
I was at the
 door at half- past
---
that I
 was in All Souls'
---
But I was n't much frightened, for
 I thought it could be to- morrow as well."

---
" You fool, for so fooling me!
---
it be to- morrow, Frank
---
" I do n't go through that experience again for some
 time
---
, I warrant you!"

---
the mistake was not such a terrible thing!
---
Now, dear
 Frank, when shall it be?"

---
God knows!
---
there was Eve.
---
The
 farmer took courage, and
---
Material causes and emotional effects are.
---
The result from capital
 employed in the production of any movement of a
 mental nature is sometimes as tremendous as the cause
 itself.
---
hence it was.

---
as they superficially appeared
---
Boldwood, it must be remembered,
---
if you remember
---
; a mere child's word on the
 point has the weight of an R.A.'s.
---
what circumstances suggest
---
what they do not suggest
---
It
 was evident.
---
; it was debasing loveliness, and.

---
This
 was a triumph; and
---
it come naturally,
---
But it had been brought about by
 misdirected ingenuity, and
---
that a freak, should
 ever have been undertaken,
---
The worst features of this arrangement were; and
---
, an apology would in-

---
Genteel strangers, whose god
 was their town,.

---
who might happen
---
it was
---
They heard the sound of wheels yet once more, and

---
it was.

---
only Mr. Bold-
 wood coming home again
---
which are to a farm what a fireplace is to a
 room
---
the
 stables,, were behind
---
, their lower portions being lost
 amid bushes of laurel.
---
as thus viewed, they pre-
 sented alternations of roan and bay, in shapes like a
 Moorish arch,.
---
the tail being a streak down the midst
 of each
---
Over these, and lost to the eye gazing in
 from the outer light, the mouths of the same animals
 could be heard.

---
The restless and shadowy figure of a colt wandered
 about a loose- box at the end,.

---
whilst the steady grind
 of all the eaters was occasionally diversified by the
 rattle of a rope or the stamp of a foot
---
till the moon's rays streamed
 in through the cobwebbed windows, or
---
total darkness
 enveloped the scene
---
That stillness,
, and seemed.
---
Stagnant or rapid, it was never
 slow.
---
when they were comedies
---
Being to please
, there was no frivolous treat-
 ment.

---
when they chanced
---
that the dark and
 silent shape so carelessly thrown a
 seed
---
Nobody knew entirely
---
though it
 was possible
---
It was now early spring-- the time of going to grass
 with the sheep, when they have the first feed of the
 meadows,.
---
before these are laid up for mowing
---
which had been blowing east for several weeks
---
The
 wind,,
 had veered to the southward, and
---
the middle of spring
 had come abruptly-- almost without a beginning.
---
It
 was that period in the vernal quarter.
---
when we map

---
the Dryads to be waking for the season
---
The
 vegetable world begins.

---
where- everything seems-help-
 less and
---
still after the bond and slavery of frost, there
 are bustlings, strainings, united thrusts, and
---
with which the powerful tugs of
 cranes and pulleys in a noisy city are but pigmy efforts
---
as the moon lights up a great
 tower
---
It is the usual experience of strong natures when they
 love.

---
It was.

---
It has been observed
 more than once
---
that the causes of love are chiefly
 subjective, and
---
which was genuine lover's love
---
Beyond
 it the ground was melodious with ripples, and the sky
 with larks; the low bleating of the flock mingling with
 both.
---
Mistress and man were engaged in the operation
 of making a lamb" take."
---
which is performed.
---
where they would remain
---
till the old sheep
 conceived an affection for the young one
---
that neither would recognize
---
The cabala of this erotic philosophy
 seemed.
---
It troubled.
---
what a great flame a little Wildfire was likely to
 kindle
---
yet so like what a flirt is supposed
---
But a
 resolution to avoid an evil is seldom framed till the evil
 is so far advanced as to make avoidance impossible.





---
The smaller human elements were kept
 out of sight
---
that enter so largely into
 all earthly living and
---
; the pettinesses doing were disguised by the
 accident of lover and and.
---
there was
---
It was the end of May.
---
when the farmer determined

---
to be no longer repulsed by trivialities or
---
distracted by
 suspense
---
The sheep- washing pool was a perfectly circular basin
 of brickwork in the meadows, full of the clearest water.

---
The grass
 about the margin at this season was a sight to remember
 long-- in a minor sort of way.
---
The outskirts of this level
 water- meadow were diversified by rounded and hollow
 pastures,.
---
that was not a
 buttercup
---
where just now every flower was a daisy
---
The river slid along noiselessly
 as a shade, the swelling reeds and sedge.
---
trees, the leaves of which were new,
 soft, and
---
their colour being
 yellow beside a green-- green beside a yellow
---
which the yellow pollen from the
 buttercups had bronzed in artistic gradations
---
A tribu-
 tary of the main stream flowed through the basin of the
 pool by an inlet and outlet at opposite points of its
 diameter.
---
all dripping wet to the very roots of their hair,
 and
---
Flagons of cider
 were rolling about upon the green.
---
They were let out
 against the stream, and through the upper opening, all
 impurities flowing away below.
---
who performed this latter operation
---
; they resembled dolphins under a
 fountain,.

---
every protuberance and angle of their clothes
 dribbling forth a small rill
---
footsteps brushing the
 grass
---
till they
 were completely past the bend of the river
---
said the farmer.

---
all expected as a beginning
---
It was lowness and quiet
.
---
it is then more impressive than speech.

---
In the same way, to say a little is often.
---
As the consciousness expands on learning that what
 was fancied to be the rumble of wheels
---
is the reverbera-
 tion of thunder,
---
I feel-- almost too much--.
---
" I have come.
---
My life is not my own
---
since I have beheld
 you clearly
---
, Miss Everdene-- I come."

---
all the motion was that of
 closing lips which had previously been a little parted.

---
" I am now forty- one years old."
---
" I may
 have been called a confirmed bachelor, and
---
I was a
 confirmed bachelor.
---
have I made any
 calculation on the subject.

---
since I have been older
---
But we all change, and
---
my change, in this matter, came
 with seeing you.
---
I have felt lately, more and more,
.

---
that my present way of living is bad in every respect
---
I feel.
---
that though I respect you
 much
---
, Mr. Boldwood,, I do not feel--
---
what would justify me to-- in
 accepting your offer
---
This giving back of dignity for dignity seemed.

---
" My life is a burden without you.
---
" I want you
---
-- I want!"

---
you to let
---
me say

---
I love you again and again
---
" I think and!"
   
---
you care enough
---
for me to listen
 to what I have to tell
---
" I wish."
---
I could say courteous flatteries to you
---
the
 farmer continued in an easier tone," and: but
---
I have neither power
 nor patience to learn such things.
---
that no other feeling can abide in me
---
;
 but I should not have spoken out
---
so wildly had I not been led
."

---
If you can love
---
me say so
---
" Mr. Boldwood, it is painful-- but
---
I am
 surprised,
---
so that I do n't know
---
I mean
---
; that I am afraid
 I ca n't marry you, much as I respect you.
---
You are too
 dignified for me to suit you, sir."
  
---
" I-- I did n't--
---
I know
---
I ought never to have dreamt
 of sending that valentine-- forgive me, sir
---
If you will only pardon my thought-
 lessness
---
, I promise never to-- --"
"
---
me
 think
---
it was something more-- that it was a sort of
 prophetic instinct-- the beginning of a feeling that you
 would like me
---
You torture me
---
it was done in
 thoughtlessness
---
to say-- I never thought of it in that light, and
.
---
I ca n't endure it
---
I wish!
 but
---
I knew
---
that I ca n't do
---
-- I can only ask.
---
if I have already got
 you
---
it is not true
---
that you have

---
as I have
---
If I have not, and come unwittingly to me to you, I can say no
 more."
  
---
I have not fallen in love with you
---
the white row of upper teeth, and keenly-
 cut lips already noticed, suggested an idea of heartless-
 ness, which was immediately contradicted by the pleasant
 eyes.

---
" But you will just think-- in kindness and conde-
--!

---
scension think
---
I fear.
---
I am too old for you, but
---
I will take
 more care of you
---
I will protect and!
---
I will indeed
---
You shall have no cares.
---
-- I can afford it--.
---
you shall never have so
 much as to look out of doors at haymaking time, or
---
I rather cling.
---
if you do n't like it
---
I will sell it, and
---
you shall
 have a pony- carriage of your own
---
I can not say how
 far above every other idea and object on earth!"

---
you seem
 to me
---
-- nobody knows--
---
God only knows
---
-- how much
 you are to me
---
I can not bear you, and
---
me to feel nothing.
---
And I am afraid they
 will notice us, Mr. Boldwood.
---
Will you let the matter
 rest now?
---
I can not think collectedly.
---
I did not know
.
---
you were going
---
O, I am wicked to
 have made you suffer so!"
---
that you do n't absolutely refuse
---
" I can do nothing.
---
I can not answer."I?"

---
" I may think of you?"

---
" Yes, I suppose."

---
you may think of me
---
us go on
---
" I will call upon you again to- morrow."

---
" Yes-- I will give you any time."
---
" I am happier now."

---
" No-- I beg you!
---
if happiness
 only comes from my agreeing
---
I must think."

---
" I will wait.
---
who did not
 know
---
The rarest offerings of the purest loves are but a self-
 indulgence, and no generosity at all.

---
In every point of
 view, ranging from politic to passionate, it was desirable
.
---
It appears

---
because possession is not
 possible without marriage, and
---
because marriage is not possible with,
 out possession
---
the method is
 the same on both sides
---
Besides, Bath-
 sheba's position as absolute mistress of a farm and house
 was a novel one, and
---
the novelty had not yet begun.

---
for it would have affected few
---
men-
 tioned
---
Still the reluctance remained.
---
that it would be ungenerous
---
; unluckily they
 always remained
---
Only a few were irrational
 assumptions; but,
---
unfortunately, they were the ones
 which most frequently grew into deeds.
  
---
All the surrounding
 cottages were more or less scenes of the same operation;
 the scurr of whetting spread into the sky from all parts
 of the village as from an armury previous to a campaign.

---
Peace and war kiss each other at their hours of prepara-
 tion-- sickles, scythes, shears, and pruning- hooks, ranking
 with swords, bayonets, and lances, in their common
 necessity for point and edge.

---
I'll turn the winch of the grindstone.
---
I want.

---
The peculiar motion involved in turning a wheel
 has a wonderful tendency to benumb the mind.
---
It
 is a sort of attenuated variety of Ixion's punishment,
 and
---
the body's centre of gravity seems.
---
Will you turn, Gabriel, and?"

---
me hold the shears
---
" My head is in a'whirl, and
---
I ca n't talk.

---
which
 required a little nicety in sharpening
---
" I wanted?"
  
---
" Yes, they did.
---
" You do n't hold
."

---
the shears right, miss--
---
I knew
---
you would n't know the
 way--
---
as we some-

---
Hands and shears were inclined and.
  
---
held thus for a peculiarly long time by the in-
 structor
---
" That will do."
---
I wo n't have!
---
them held
---
the grinding went on.
  "
---
Odd was not the idea
---
" What did they say?"

---
before the
 year was out
---
" I thought so by the look of them!
---
Why, there's
 nothing in it.
---
A more foolish remark was never made,
 and
---
I want!
---
you to contradict it
---
that's."
  
---
what I came for
---
" They must have heard our conversation.
---
you mean
---
I mean this

", that, I bain't going.
---
I have already tried!"

---
" I said."
---
I wanted
---
you just to mention
---
that it was
 not true
---
I was going
---
" I can say that to them.

---
And I could likewise give an opinion to' ee on what
 you have done."

---
" I daresay.
---
But I do n't want."

your opinion."I suppose not

It must be added, however,.

that

This is a lover's
 most stoical virtue,.

as the lack of it is a lover's most
 venial sin

 ject would be

The next thing was.

---
" Perhaps you do n't like the rudeness of my repri-
, for I know it is rudeness; but

I thought

---
it would do good
---
On the contrary, my opinion of you is so low,
---
that
 I see in your abuse the praise of discerning people
---
" I am glad you do n't mind it,."
  
---
for I said it honestly
 and with every serious meaning
---
" I see.
---
when you try
---
But, unfortunately, not to
 speak in jest you are amusing-- but and.
---
when you wish

---
just as to avoid seriousness you sometimes say a sensible word
 It was a hard hit,
---
" I may ask,?
---
I suppose,
---
where in particular my
 unworthiness lies

my not marrying you, perhaps
---
I have

" long given up thinking of that matter."Or wishing it, I suppose.

and it was
 apparent.

had Gabriel pro-
 tested
---
; the
 impetuosity of passion unrequited is bearable,
---
even if
 it stings and
---
there is a triumph in the
 humiliation, and a tenderness in the strife.
---
This was
, and.

" My opinion is(), merely as a pastime

since you ask it

that you are

you do n't care for

" Nor will I for a minute.

So you'll please!"

---
It may have been a peculiarity-- at any rate.
---
Very well, so I will.

" I should be even better pleased to
 go at once.

me see your face any more

" Very well, Miss Everdene-- so it shall be."

when the effect
 was heightened by a rather dashing velvet dress

 fully put on before a glass

Having once received the stimulus they went round among the sheep
 with a will.

The majority of the afflicted animals were

These were

the others driven into the adjoining
 field.

as they rolled
 there--
 Swoln with wind and the rank mist

Many of them foamed at the mouth,.

their breathing
 being quick and short,

 fearfully distended

" They must be pierced in the side with a thing made

" Can you do it?

Can I?"

It must
 be done in a particular spot.

If ye go to the right or
 left but.

Not

" Then they must die. in a resigned tone.

All then stalked or in consternation,.

they had vanished through the gate, and

One of the ewes here contracted its muscles horribly,

The
 leap was an astonishing one.

The ewe fell heavily, and

The sheep was dead.

 The most vigorous expression of a resolution does
 not always coincide with the greatest vigour of the
 resolution itself.

It is often flung out as a sort of prop
 to support a decaying conviction which, whilst strong,
 required no enunciation to prove it so.

 halter by way of rein.

Tall
 cantered along the bridle- path through Sixteen Acres,
 Sheeplands, Middle Field

The Flats, Cappel's Piece,

 opposite hill, backed by blue firs.

Nothing availed.

The note was despatched as the message

It was an anxious quarter of an hour that intervened
 between the messenger's departure and the sound of the
 horse's tramp again outside.

She- could not watch this

The case, however, was a promising one.

Such imperiousness

It was a moment.

It was a small tube or trochar, with a lance passing

A current of air rushed up the tube, forcible

THE SHEEP- SHEARERS


 MEN thin away to insignificance and oblivion quite as
 often by not making the most of good spirits when they
 have them as by lacking good spirits when they are
 indispensable.
---
conditions which, powerless without an opportunity as
 an opportunity without them is barren,
---
when the favourable- con-
 junction should have occurred
---
the neap might soon come which
 could not.

---
It was the first day of June, and
---
the sheep- shearing
 season culminated, the landscape, even to the leanest
 pasture,.
---
Every green was
 young,
---
every pore was open, and
---
every stalk was swollen
 with racing currents of juice.
---
God was palpably present
 in the country, and
---
the devil had gone with the world
 to town.
---
None of these were
,.
---
each appearing
 the decent mean
 between a high and low caste Hindoo
---
An angularity
 of lineament, and a fixity of facial machinery in general,
 proclaimed.

---
that serious work was the order of the day
---
They sheared in the great barn,
---
which on ground- plan resembled a
 church with transepts
---
It not only emulated the form
 of the neighbouring church of the parish, but.
---
Whether the barn had ever formed
---
one
 of a group of conventual buildings nobody seemed
---
to be
 aware; no trace of such surroundings remained.
---
The
 vast porches at the sides, lofty enough to admit a waggon
 laden to its highest with corn in the sheaf, were spanned
 by heavy- pointed arches of stone, broadly and boldly
---
cut,
 whose very simplicity was the origin of a grandeur not
 apparent in erections where more ornament has been
 attempted.
---
tied in by huge collars, curves, and diagonals
---
The dusky, filmed, chestnut roof, braced
 and, was
 far nobler in design, because more wealthy in material,
 than nine- tenths of those in our modern churches.

---
Along each side wall was a range of striding buttresses,
 throwing deep shadows on the spaces between them,
 which were perforated by lancet openings,.

---
One could say about this barn.
---
, what could hardly
 be said of either the church or the castle, akin to it in
 age and style,
---
which had dictated its
 original erection
---
that the purpose was the same with that
---
to which it
 was still applied
---
which had suffered no mutila-
 tion at the hands of time
---
Here at least the spirit of
 the ancient builders was at one with the spirit of the
 modern beholder.
---
Standing before this abraded pile,
 the eye regarded its present usage,.
---
which had heaped it up
---
that four centuries
 had neither proved
---
it to be founded on a mistake,

---
The fact inspired any hatred of its purpose, nor
---
that had battered it down
---
For
 once medievalism and modernism had a common stand-
 point.
---
The lanccolate windows, the time- eaten arch-
 stones and chamfers, the orientation of the axis, the
 misty chestnut work of the rafters, referred to no exploded
 fortifying art or worn- out religious creed.
---
The defence
 and salvation of the body by daily bread is still a study,
 a religion, and a desire.

---
To- day the large side doors were thrown.
---
which was
 the wood threshing- floor in the centre
---
polished by the beating of flails
 for many generations
---
till it had grown as slippery and
 as rich in hue as the state- room floors of an Elizabethan
 mansion
---
the sun slanting in
 upon their bleached shirts, tanned arms
---
Beneath them a captive sheep lay.

---
as misgiving merged in terror,
---
till it quivered
 like the hot landscape outside
---
This picture of to- day in its frame of four hundred
 years ago did not produce.
---
that marked contrast between
 ancient and modern which is implied by the contrast
 of date
---
In comparison with cities, Weatherbury was
 immutable.
---
In London, twenty or thirty- years ago are old times;
 in Paris ten years, or five; in Weatherbury three or
 four score years were included in the mere present,
 and.
---
nothing less than a century set a mark on its
 face or tone
---
Five decades hardly modified the cut of
 a gaiter, the embroidery of a smock- frock, by the breadth
 of a hair.
---
Ten generations failed.
---
In these Wessex nooks the busy out-
 sider's ancient times are only old
---
So the barn was natural to the shearers, and
---
the
 shearers were in harmony with the barn.

---
The spacious ends of the building, answering ecclesi-
 astically to nave and chancel extremities, were fenced
 off with hurdles.
---
, the sheep being all collected in a crowd
 within these two enclosures; and
---
in one angle a catching-
 pen was formed,
---
in which three or four sheep were

---
continuously kept ready
---
for the shearers to seize without
 loss of time
---
In the background, mellowed by tawny
 shade
---
They were
---
indifferently well assisted
 by the old maltster,
---
when the malting season from
 October to April had passed
---
that there was no cutting or wounding
 through carelessness
---
that the animals were shorn
 close
---
who flitted and
---
there is a silence which says much
---
since you took
 the first lock from its forehead
---
It is the first time that
 I have ever seen one done in less than half an hour."

---
The clean, sleek creature arose from its fleece--.

---
how
 perfectly like Aphrodite rising from the foam
---
which lay on the floor
 in one soft cloud,
---
the portion visible
 being the inner surface only, which, never before exposed,
 was white as snow, and without flaw or blemish of the
 minutest kind
---
" Yes, Mister Oak; here I be!"

---
B. E." is
 away the simple
 dam leaps, panting, over the board into the shirtless
 flock outside.
---
who will,
 however, never experience the superlative comfort
 derivable from the wool
---
as it here exists, new and pure
 
---
woollen
 as cream is superior to milk- and- water
---
The rams, old
 ewes, and two- shear ewes had duly undergone, and
---
Nobody seemed, but
---
the talk,, was now.
  
---
when the influence is great
---
What they conversed about
---
Standing beside the sheep already
 shorn, they went on talking again.
---
that in quiet discussion of any matter within reach
 of the speakers' eyes, these are usually fixed upon it
---
The animal plunged
---
what you are doing yourself
---
To an outsider there was not much to complain of
 in this remark; but
---
, it had a sting
---
, the wound was anointed, and
---
the
 shearing continued.

---
before they turned away
---
" I am going now.

---
The horses' heads were put about, and
---
they trotted
 away.

---
That means matrimony."
---
said Temperance Miller,
.

---
I reckon."
---
that's the size o't
---
Well, better we d over the mixen than over the moor,"
 said Laban Tall,.

---
Henery Fray spoke,
---
exhibiting miserable eyes at the
 same time:" I do n't see.
---
it be,
---
We learn but.

---
that it is not the rays which bodies
 absorb,
---
which they reject
---
those, that give them the
 colours they are known by; and
---
people
 are specialized by their dislikes and antagonisms
---
whilst
 their goodwill is looked upon as no attribute at all
---
Henery continued in a more complaisant mood: 
---
a battered frame dared
---
You all know,
---
how I come down with my powerful words
---
when
 my pride is boiling wi
---
We do
---
", we do, Henery."

---
So I said,".
---
Mistress Everdene, there's places empty,
 and
---
I did n't say spite--"
---
" I said(),
---
I would have said it,.
---
salvation overtook me for it
---
Such is my spirit."

---
when I
 have a mind
---
" You see the artfulness?
---
I did n't put it so plain.
---
so I could lay it on all the
 stronger
---
That was my depth!...
---
I believe
."

---
that I do
---
" Ah, neighbour Oak-- how'st know?"
---
said, Henery,
 mildly.

---
Ye have a right to believe it.
---
"" said Henery, with
 dudgeon;" a very true right.
---
But I mid see a little
 distance into things!
---
To be long- headed enough for a
 baily's place is a poor mere trifle-- yet a trifle more than
 nothing.
---
However, I look round upon life quite cool.

---
Do you heed me, neighbours?
---
My words, though made
 as simple as I can."

---
" O yes, Henery, we quite heed ye."
" A strange old piece, goodmen-- whirled about from
 here to yonder, as if I were nothing!
---
But I have my depths
---
I might gird at a certain shepherd, brain to
 brain.
---
But no-- O no!"
" A strange old piece, ye say!".
---
bain't  half  gone  yet; and?
---
Were n't I stale in
 wedlock afore?'
---
ye were out of arms
---
when there's people far past four- score-- a
 boast'weak as water
---
It was the unvaying custom in Weatherbury to
 sink minor differences when the maltster had to be
 pacified.

---
Jan Coggan.-" Malter,
 we feel, and
---
nobody
 can gainsay it
---
" Ye be a very
 rare old  spectacle, malter, and
---
we all admire ye for that
 gift."

---
when my senses were in
 prosperity
---
said the maltster.

---
you was--'
---
That matters should
 continue
---
pleasant Maryann spoke,
---
?" said Maryann.
---
I do n't expect to
  at my time of life
---
If I could hear of such a thing

---
Pestilent
 moods had come, and.
---
This was mere exclamation-- the froth of the
 storm.
---
We workfolk
---
shall have some lordly- junketing
 to- night.
---
This morning I see'em making the
 great puddens in the milking- pails-- lumps of fat as big
 as yer thumb
---
I've never seed such
 splendid large knobs of fat before in the days of my
 life.

---
-- they never used
---
I do n't know."

---
what was
 in within
---
And there's two bushels of biffins for apple- pies,
---
"
 said Maryann.

---
Well, I hope."
---
" Yes; victuals and drink is a cheerful thing,
 and.'
---
if the form of words
 may be used
---
we perish,."

A SECOND DECLARATION


 FOR the shearing- supper a long table was placed on the
 grass- plot beside the house,.
---
the end of the table being
 thrust over the sill of the wide parlour window and a
 foot or two into the room
---
The gentleman- farmer was dressed in cheerful style,
 in a new coat and white waistcoat,.
---
who had been dismissed for theft
---
Supper being ended
---
l've lost my love and l care
---
not,
 I've lost my love, and l care not
---
;
 I shall soon have another

---
That's better than t'other!

---
I've lost my love, and
---
I care not.

---
This lyric, when concluded, was received with a
 silently appreciative gaze at the table,.

---
who are independent of notices in the papers
---
that the
 performance, like a work by those established authors
, was a
 well- known delight which required no applause
---
I be all but in liquor, and.
---
the gift is wanting in
 me
---
Nonsense; wou'st never be so ungrateful, Joseph
---
And mistress is looking hard at
 ye, as much as to say,", Joseph Poor-
 grass."

---
; well, I must suffer it!...
---
" No, yer blushes."
---
" I always tries.
---
when
 a beauty's eyes get fixed on me
---
' tis willed
---
if so be they do
---
, they must
---
I do n't know
---
It would be a poor plain
 ballet of my own composure."

---
said the supper- party.

---
the tune of which
 consisted of the key- note and another,.
---
the latter being

---
the sound chiefly dwelt upon
---
th'-e
 I sow'-ed

---
I sow'-ed the'-e seeds' of love'
---
,
 I- it was'.

---
all' i'-in the'-e spring',
 I- in A'-pril', Ma'-ay, a'-nd sun'-ny' June',
 When sma'-all bi'-irds they' do' sing
---
` They do sing'."

---
Ay; and there was a pretty place at" seeds of
 love."
---
which will afflict little
 people when other persons are particularly serious
---
Now then again-- the next bar; I'll help.

---
ye to flourish
 up the shrill notes where yer wind is rather wheezy: --

---
O the wi'-il- lo'-ow tree' will' twist',
 And
---
the wil'-low' tre'-ee wi'ill twine'
---
But the singer could not be set.
---
It was still the beaming time of evening, though

---
, the western lines of light taking the earth
 without alighting upon it to any extent, or illuminating
 the dead levels at all.
---
The sun had crept round the
 tree as a last effort before death, and
---
, the shearers' lower parts becoming steeped in
 embrowning twilight,.

---
whilst their heads and shoulders
 were still enjoying day,
---
sustained brilliancy that seemed inherent rather than
 acquired
---
The sun went down in an ochreous mist; but
---
they
 sat, and, and.
---
The slow twilight expanded and.

---
completely before the signs of moving were shown
---
which
 revealed
---
Next came the question of the evening.
---
before they
 went home
---
who hastened up into the coveted
 atmosphere
---
Have you brought your flute
---
it soon swelled
 to a steady clearness.
---
Subsequent events caused even years, by more than one of those who were gathered
 there: --

---
one
 of the verses to be remembered for many months, and

---
a winning tongue had
---
The shearers reclined
 against each other as at suppers in the early ages of the
 world, and
---
so silent and absorbed were they.

---
when the last tone loitered on
 to an inexpressible close
---
which is the attar of applause
---
It is scarcely necessary to state.
---
It was
---
when the rest were all looking
 away
---
when they thanked or
---
when they were inattentive
---
The meaning lay in the difference between
 actions
---
, none of which had any meaning of itself;
 and
---
which lovers are

---
Recovering
 from the softer impressions, the shearers rose
---
I like
---
where praise is due,
---
I'm sure I should never have believed it if we had n't
 proved it,,
---
that
 every cup, every one of the best knives and forks, and
 every empty bottle be in their place as perfect now as
 at the beginning, and not one stole at all
---
I'm sure I do n't deserve half the praise you give
 me."
---
said the virtuous thief, grimly.

---
Yes, I'm proud to say.

---
we thank ye for it,
 Pennyways."
---
when nothing more was
 visible of the inside of the parlour than a thin and still
 chink of light between the shutters
---
At this time of departure,, a passionate scene
 was in course of enactment there."

---
though it was
 a triumph which had rather been contemplated than
 desired
---
it was
 with what Keats daintily calls a too happy happiness.

---
which
 quenched much of the pleasure
---
" I will try.
---
if I
 can believe in any way that I shall make you a good
 wife I shall indeed be willing to marry you.
---
I do n't want.
---
I would rather ask you
---
till I can see
---
my situation better."But you have every reason to
 believe that then-- --"
" I have every reason to hope that at the end of the five or
 six weeks, between this time and harvest, that
 you say you are going to be away from home
---
distinctly, I do n't promise yet
---
" It is enough
---
I do n't ask more.
---
I can wait on
 those dear words.
---
that make it grand
---
whether the sin quite deserved
 the penalty
---
after a
 while the situation was not without a fearful joy
---
when that is

---
The
 facility amalgamated with a little triumph, is marvellous.





---
that
 all was right and safe for the night
---
they only seem.

---
that a horse might not be well bedded
---
;, the fowls
 not all in, or a door not closed.

---
This night the buildings were inspected as usual,
 and
---
the stillness were steady munch-
 ings of many mouths, and stentorian breathings from all
 but invisible noses, ending in snores and puffs like the
 blowing of bellows slowly
---
when the lively imagination might assist
 the eye
---
until one got

---
that these phenomena were the features and persons of
 Daisy, Whitefoot, Bonny- lass, Jolly- O, Spot, Twinkle- eye,
 etc
---
which had been planted
 some years earlier
---
By reason of the density of the interwoven foliage
 overhead, it was gloomy there at cloudless noontide,
 twilight in the evening, dark as midnight at dusk, and
 black as the ninth plague of Egypt at midnight.
---
To
 describe the spot is a vast, low, naturally formed
 hall, the plumy ceiling of which was supported by slender
 pillars of living wood
---
to call it, the floor being covered with a soft
 dun carpet of dead spikelets and mildewed cones, with
 a tuft of grass- blades here and there.

---
This bit of the path was always the crux of the
 night's ramble, though,
---
footsteps enter-
 ing the track at the opposite end
---
It was certainly a
 rustle of footsteps.
---
that the path was public, and
---
that the traveller was
 probably some villager returning home
---
The noise approached and
---
" Have I hurt you, mate?"

---
" We have got hitched together somehow
---
, I think."

---
" A lady, I should have said."
"."

---
It does n't matter
---
" Is that a dark lantern you have?
---
I fancy so."
---
If you'll allow me."

---
I'll open it, and
---
A hand seized the lantern,
---
the door was opened
---
what the sound of a trumpet
 is
---
Gloom, the genius loci at all times hitherto,
 was
---
now totally overthrown, less by the lantern- light
 than by what the lantern lighted.
---
I'll unfasten you in one moment,."
---
O no-- I can do it
---
The unfastening was not such a trifling affair.
---
The
 rowel of the spur had so wound itself among the gimp
 cords in those few moments
---
, that separation was likely
 to be a matter of time.

---
the lantern standing on the
 ground betwixt them.
---
It radiated
 upwards into their faces, and.

---
till it wasted to nothing
---
You are a prisoner
---
", miss; it is no use blinking the
 matter."
---
said the soldier, drily.
---
" I must cut your dress
."

---
if you are in such a hurry
---
" It would n't be necessary," and
---
if you could wait a
 moment
---
it nevertheless seemed
.
---
" Thank you for the sight of such a beautiful face!"
 said the young sergeant, without ceremony.

---
"' Twas un-
 willingly shown."
---
with as much
 dignity-- which was very little--
---
I like you the better for that incivility,
---
I should have liked--
---
" I wish
---
-- you had never shown
 yourself to me by intruding here!"
---
" I deserve the chastisement your words give me.

---
" What, Beauty, and drag you after me?
---
Do but
 look; I never saw such a tangle!"

---
" O,' tis shameful of you; you have been making
 it worse on purpose!"

---
-- you have
---
" Indeed, I do n't think so."
---
said the sergeant, with a
 merry twinkle.

---
" I tell you!"
---
you have
---
I insist upon undoing it.
---
Certainly, miss; I am not of steel."
---
" I am
 thankful for beauty,.
---
even when' tis thrown to me like
 a bone to a dog
---
These moments will be over too
 soon!"

---
All in good time; it will soon be done
---
", I perceive,"

---
" This trifling provokes, and-- and-- --"
"
---
I do n't care
---
" Who are you, then?"

---
, who can so well afford
---
I am staying in
 this place.--
---
it is undone at last
---
, you see.

---
Your light fingers were more eager than mine.
---
I wish!"

---
it
 had been the knot of knots,
---
which there's no untying
---
This was worse and worse.
---
No, I say; but
---
when the
 regiment was at Casterbridge
---
" Yes; that's the name.
---
" O! miss-- I blush!
---
But
 I know.
---
who might have

---
which is a great deal; and
---
" Which is a great deal more.
---
Is it true?"

---
it was
; but
---
that I do n't answer for,
---
as it was

---
Ah! such a blessing it
 is
---
to be high- born; nobility of blood will shine out even
 in the ranks and files.
---
" I believe so.
---
When they
 want.
---
which is often,
---
when they want and
---
which is sometimes;
---
when they want
 no nonsense, which is seldom
---
Moreover, by chance or by devilry, the
 ministrant was antecedently made interesting by being
 a handsome stranger who had evidently seen better
 days.

---
It was a fatal omission of.

CHAPTER XXV



 THE NEW ACQUAINTANCE DESCRIBED


 IDIOSYNCRASY and vicissitude.

---
For it may be argued with great plausibility

---
that reminiscence is less an endowment than a disease,
 and
---
that expectation in its only comfortable form-- that
 of absolute faith-- is practically an impossibility
---
; whilst
 in the form of hope and the secondary compounds,
 patience, impatience, resolve, curiosity, it is a constant
 fluctuation between pleasure and pain.

---
To
 set against this negative gain there may have been
 some positive losses from a certain narrowing of the
 higher tastes and sensations which it entailed.
---
But
 limitation of the capacity is never recognized as a loss
 by the loser.
---
therefrom:  in this attribute
---
moral or
 aesthetic poverty contrasts plausibly with material,,
---
who suffer
---
since
 those do not mind it
---
who mind
 it
---
whilst those soon cease
---
what sober people missed
---
a system of ethics above all
 others calculated; and
---
the possibility of the
 favour gained
---
had fre-
 quently been tempered with a smile
---
:  thence it sometimes happened.
---
that,
 wished, any particular deed formed a dark background
 which threw them into fine relief
---
The sergeant's
 vicious phases being the offspring of impulse, and

---
, they were exercised on.
---
whatever object chance
 might place in their way
---
being without the power to combine them,
 the comprehension became engaged with trivialities
 whilst waiting
---
for the will to direct it, and
---
the force
 wasted itself in useless grooves through unheeding the
 comprehension.

---
it acted
 upon for the good of the complemental being alluded
 to
---
With the majority such an opinion is shelved with
 all those trite aphorisms which require some catastrophe
 to bring their tremendous meanings thoroughly home.

---
it
 seems co
---
that this flattery must
 be reasonable
---
it is for their happiness, perhaps
---
, that accident
 has never settled it for them
---
, that a
 male dissembler, may acquire powers
 reaching to the extremity of perdition
---
taught
 to many by unsought and wringing occurrences
---
And
 some profess, and.

---
casually that in
 dealing with womankind the only alternative to flattery
 was cursing and
---
There was no third method.

---
They consisted in about equal proportions
 of gnarled and flexuous forms,.
---
In the first mead they were
.

---
From behind the waggon a bright scarlet spot
 emerged, and.
---
It was the gallant sergeant, who had come hay-
 making for pleasure; and
---
nobody could deny.

---
" Little did I think.
---
it was you
---
I was

---
if I had reflected,
 the" Queen of the Corn- market"( truth is truth at any
 hour of the day or night, and
---
I heard you."

---
I say,.
---
I step across now.
---
having been
 led by my feelings
---
I am no stranger to the place
---
as I told you, and
---
when I was a
 lad
---
I have been doing the same for you today."

---
" I suppose."
---
I must thank you for that, Sergeant
 Troy
---
said the Queen of the Corn- market, in an in-
 differently grateful tone.

---
The sergeant looked hurt and sad."
---
Indeed you
 must not, Miss Everdene.
---
" Why could you
 think such a thing necessary?"

---
" I am glad it is not."

---
if I may ask without offence."

---
" Because I do n't much want."

---
" I am afraid I have made a hole with my tongue
 that my heart will never mend.
---
I
 said--
---
you must own that; and--

---
the least I could say
---
that I own myself
---
" There is some talk I could do without more easily
 than money."

---
That remark is a sort of digression."

---
It means."

---
that I would rather have your room
 than your company
---
I'll stay here
---
that the assistance render-
 ing forbade a harsh repulse
---
I suppose
---
there is a praise
 which is rudeness, and
---
that may be mine
---
At the
 same time there is a treatment which is injustice, and
 that may be yours.
---
who
 has never been taught concealment
---
Indeed there's no such case between us."
---
" I do n't allow."

---
strangers to be bold and
 impudent-- even in praise of me
---
" Ah-- it is not the fact but the method which offends
 you."
---
" But I have the sad satis-
 faction of knowing that my words, whether pleasing or
 offensive, are unmistakably true.
---
Would you have had
?

---
me look at you, and
---
if they come near you
---
I could n't tell any such ridiculous lie about
 a beauty
---
" It is all pretence--!".
---
what you are saying
---
" You have a rare invention, Sergeant
 Troy.
---
Why could n't you have passed by me that
 night, and?
---
-- that was all I meant to
 reproach you for."

---
Because I was n't going to.
---
Half the pleasure of
 a feeling lies in being able to express it on the spur of
 the moment, and
---
I let out mine.
---
It would have been
 just the same
---
if you had been the reverse person-- ugly
 and old--
---
I should have exclaimed about it in the same
 way."

---
" How long is it, then?"

---
since you have been so afflicted with
 strong feeling
---
" Oh, ever since I was big enough to know loveliness
 from deformity."

---
"' Tis to be hoped your sense of the difference you
 speak of does n't stop at faces, but."

---
" I wo n't speak of morals or religion-- my own or
 anybody else's.
---
Though perhaps I should have been a
 very good Christian."

---
But-- Miss Everdene-- you do forgive me?"

---
" You say such things."

---
" I said!
---
you were beautiful, and
---
I'll say so still; for,
 by--  so you are
---
ever I saw, or
!
---
may I fall dead this instant
---
I wo n't listen to you
---
-- you are so
 profane!
---
" I again say.

---
There's nothing remarkable in my saying so
---
, is there?

---
I'm sure the fact is evident enough.
---
Miss Everdene,
 my opinion may be and, for the matter of that, too insignificant to convince
 you, but?"

---
surely it is honest, and
---
n't it be
---
why ca ex-
 cused
---
Because it-- it is n't a correct one.
---
Am I any worse for breaking the
 third of that Terrible Ten than you for breaking the
 ninth?"

---
Well, it does n't seem quite true to me.
---
that I am
 fascinating
---
But
 surely you must have been told by everybody of what
 everybody notices?
---
and you should take their words
 for it."

---
" They do n't say so exactly."

---
O yes, they must!
---
""
" Well, I mean to my face,.
---
as you do
---
you know
---
" But they think so?"

---
" No-- that is---- --.

---
I certainly have heard but
---
they do
---
that was the purport of the simple
 reply, guarded as it was-- capitulation, unknown to her-
 self
---
Never did a fragile tailless sentence convey a
 more perfect meaning.
---
probably too the devil smiled from
 a loop- hole in Tophet, for the moment
---
which was
---
that the seed to lift the foundation
 had taken root in the chink
---
:  the remainder was a mere
 question of time and natural changes.

---
There the truth comes out!"
---
said the soldier, in
 reply.
---
that a young lady can live in a
 buzz of admiration without knowing something about it
---
well, Miss Everdene, you are--
---
pardon my blunt
 way-- you are rather an injury to our race than other-
 wise.

---
" O, it is true enough.
---
I may as well be hung for
 a sheep as a lamb( an old country, but
---
it will do for a rough soldier), and.
---
so I
 will speak my mind, regardless of your pleasure, and
 without hoping or intending to get your pardon
---
Why,
 Miss Everdene, it is in this manner.
---
that your good
 looks may do more
---
"
 The sergeant looked down the mead in critical abstrac-
 ion.
---
your eyes will be-
 witch scores on scores into an unavailing fancy for you
 you can only marry one of that many
---
twenty will endeavour to
---
drown the bitterness of
 espised love in drink; twenty more will mope away
 their lives without a wish or attempt to make a mark in
 he world,
---
because they have no ambition apart from
 their attachment to you
---
; twenty more-- the susceptible
 person myself possibly among them-- will be always
.
---
where they may just see
 you
---
The rest may try.
---
they might have married
---
There's my tale.
---
That's."

---
why I
 say
---
Do you read
 French
---
No; I began, but."
---
when I got to the verbs,
---
" I do
---
if you can
 only fight half as winningly as you can talk
---
, you are
 able to make a pleasure of a bayonet wound
---
that I derive any pleasure from what you tell me
---
" I know
---
you do not-- I know it perfectly."
---
, it stands
---
that my poor
 rough- and- ready mixture of praise and blame can not
 convey much pleasure
---
as I may be
---
Fool, I am not so
 conceited as to suppose that!"

---
" I think, nevertheless."
---
you-- are conceited
---
because its vigour was overwhelming
---
" I would not own it to anybody else-- nor
---
do I
 exactly to you.
---
Still, there might have been some self-
 conceit in my foolish supposition the other night.
---
I
 knew but
---
what I said in admiration
---
that might be an
 opinion too often forced upon you to give any pleasure

---
I certainly did think."

---
that the kindness of your
 nature might prevent
---
you judging an uncontrolled
 tongue harshly---- and
---
which you have done
---
when I
 am working hard
---
" Well, you need not think more of that
---
: perhaps you
 did not mean
---
to be rude to me by speaking out your
 mind: indeed, I believe.
---
you did not
---
" And I thank
 you for giving help here.
---
mind you do n't
 speak to me again in that way, or in any other,."

---
unless
 I speak to you
---
That is to hard!"

---
" No, it is n't.
---
Why is it?"

---
You will never speak to me
---
"; for I shall not be
 here long.
---
I am soon going back again to the miser-
 able monotony of drill-- and perhaps our regiment will
 be ordered out soon.
---
And yet you take away the one
 little ewe- lamb of pleasure that I have in this dull life
 of mine.
---
When are you going from here
---
" But how can it give you pleasure?"

---
as you do
 -- what my offence is based on
---
I you do care so much for a silly trifle of that
 kind, then
---
", I do n't mind.
---
" But you ca n't really care for a
 word from me?
---
you only say."

---
so-- I think
---
you only
 say so
---
" that's unjust-- but
---
I wo n't repeat the remark.
---
I
 am too gratified to get such a mark of your friendship
 at any price to cavil at the tone.
---
I
 do n't know
---
" Well."
" Then you know nothing of what such an experience
 is like-- and!"

---
Heaven forbid
---
that you ever should
---
What is it like?
---
I am
 interested in knowing."

---
" Put shortly, it is not being able to think, hear, or
 look in any direction except one without wretchedness,
 nor there without torture."

---
Ah, sergeant, it wo n't do
---
"-- you are pretending!
---
" Your words are too dashing
."

---
" I am not, upon the honour of a soldier"
"
---
But why is it so?
---
-- Of course I ask for mere pas-
 time."

---
Because you are so distracting-- and
---
I am."

---
" You look like it."

---
" I am indeed."

---
" Why, you only saw me the other night!"

---
" That makes no difference.
---
The lightning works in-
 stantaneously.
---
I loved you then, at once--."

---
as I do now
---
and you don"t.
---
" There is- no such sudden feeling in people.
---
I wo n't
 listen to you any longer.
---
, I wish!"

---
I knew
---
what
 o'clock it is--
---
I am going--
---
I have wasted too much time
 here already
---
" I have not just at present-- I am about to get a
 new one."

---
No. You shall be given one.
---
" That watch has a history.

---
" What do you see?"

---
" It's the motto
 of the Earls of Severn.
---
That watch belonged to the
 last lord, and.
---
till I came of age,
---
when it was

---
It was all the fortune that ever I
 inherited.
---
That watch has regulated imperial interests
 in its time-- the stately ceremonial, the courtly assigna-
 tion, pompous travels, and
---
lordly sleeps.
---
Now it is
 yours.
"
---
But, Sergeant Troy, I can not take this--
---
I can not!
---
What are you doing?
---
The sergeant retreated.

---
" Keep it-- do, Miss Everdene-- keep it!" said the
 erratic child of impulse.
---
" The fact of your possessing
 it makes it worth ten times as much to me.
---
A more
 plebeian one will answer my purpose just as well, and
 the pleasure of knowing whose heart my old one beats
 against-- well, I wo n't speak of that.
---
It is in far
 worthier hands than ever it has been in before."

---
" But indeed I ca n't have it!"
---
O, how can you do such a thing
---
;
 that is!
---
if you really mean it
---
You should
 not be so reckless, indeed, Sergeant Troy!"

---
better, I love you
 more.
---
That's."
---
how I can do it
---
said the sergeant, with
 an intonation of such exquisite fidelity to nature that it.

---
whilst it had been quiescent
---
Can
 it be!
---
O, how can it be,!
---
that you care for me, and
 so suddenly,
---
You have seen so little of me:
---
I may
 not be really so
---
as I seem to you
---
I can not and.
---
, your generosity is too great
---
I have

---
why should you
 be so kind to me?"

---
it was again suspended,
---
The truth was,.
---
" And my workfolk see, and.
---
me following you about the
 field
---
O, this is dreadful!"
---
" I did not quite mean."
---
you to accept it at first, for it
 as my one poor patent of nobility
---
;" but, upon my soul, I wish you would now.

---
But you are too
 lovely even to care to be kind as others are."

---
" No, no; don"t say so!
---
I have reasons for reserve
 which I can not explain."

---
it be, then
---
it be
---
;" I must be leaving you now
---
And
 will you speak to me for these few weeks of my stay?"

---
Indeed I will.
---
Yet, I do n't know!
---
if I will
---
O,
 why did you come and!"

---
" Perhaps in setting a gin, I have caught myself.

---
Such things have happened.
---
Well, will you let me
 work in your fields?"
---
" Yes, I suppose so
---
if it is any pleasure to you.
---
;"
" Miss Everdene, I thank you.
"
---
O, what have I done
---
What
 does it mean!
---
I wish!





---
I knew
---
how much of it was
 true
---
THE Weatherbury bees were late in their swarming this
 year.
---
Not only
 were they late this year, but unruly.
---
they would
---
there defy all invaders who did not come armed
 with ladders and staves to take them.

---
This was the case at present.
---
shaded by one hand
---
till
 they ultimately halted by one of the unwieldy trees
 spoken of
---
A process somewhat analogous to that of
 alleged formations of the universe, time and times ago,
 was observable.
---
The bustling swarm had swept the sky
 in a scattered and uniform haze, which now thickened to
 a nebulous centre
---
: this glided on to a bough and.

---
till it formed a solid black spot upon the
 light
---
me assist you
---
Miss Everdene, let; you should not
 attempt such a thing alone."

---
How fortunate I am!
---
" to have dropped in at this
 moment" exclaimed the sergeant.

---
will
 you shake them in for me?
---
Will I!
---
" Why, of course I will.
---
How
 blooming you are to- day!"
---
" But you must have on the veil and gloves, or
---
you'll
 be stung fearfully!"

---
Ah, yes. I must put on the veil and gloves.
---
Will
 you kindly show me?"

---
" And you must have the broad- brimmed hat, too, for
 your cap."

---
they'd
 reach your face
---
So a whimsical fate ordered.

---
holding
 up this hive makes
---
one's arm ache worse than a week
 of sword- exercise
---
When the manoeuvre was complete

---
" Would you be good enough to
 untie me and let me out?
---
I am nearly stifled inside
 this silk cage."

---
I have never seen
---
that you spoke of
---
would you like to?
---
who had, of this strange and glorious perform-
 ance,
---
who had

---
its being the most
 flashing affair conceivable;
---
" Yes; I should like."

---
And so you shall
---
; you shall see."

---
me go through it
---
me consider
---
Not with a walking- stick-- I do n't care.

---
lt must be a real sword."

---
" Yes, I know;
---
and I have no sword here; but
---
I
 think.
---
I could get one by the evening
---
Now, will you
 do this?"

---
I could n't on any account.

---
Surely you might?
---
Nobody would know."

---
If I were to
---
Might
 I not?
---
" I do n't see.
---
why you want

---
I'll come.
---
It will not take five minutes.
---
At eight o'clock this midsummer evening,, a soft brushing-
 by of garments might have been heard among them,
 and
---
It disappeared on the other
 side.

---
" I heard.
---
you rustling through the fern
---
before I saw
 you
---
The pit was a saucer- shaped concave,
---
the sunshine to reach their
 heads
---
Standing in the centre, the sky overhead was

---
met by a circular horizon of fern
---
:  this grew nearly to
 the bottom of the slope and.
---
The
 middle within the belt of verdure was floored with a
 thick flossy carpet of moss and grass,.

---
that the foot was
---
which,, gleamed a sort of greeting,
 like a living thing,"
---
first, we have four right and four
 left cuts
---
Infantry cuts
 and guards are more interesting than ours, to my mind;
 but
---
they are not so swashing.
---
They have seven cuts
 and three thrusts.
---
Well,
 next, our cut one is--
 so."
---
as if you were sowing your corn
---
as if
 you were hedging
---
as if you were reaping
 --
---
as if you were threshing-- in that way.

---
The thrusts are these:  one
---
,
 two, three, four, right; one, two, three, four, left."
---
" I'd rather not; though
 I do n't mind your twos and fours; but
---
your ones and
 threes are terrible
---
I'll let you off the ones and threes.

---
Then there's."
---
There,
 those are the stereotyped forms.
---
The infantry have
 two most diabolical upward cuts, which we are too
 humane to use.
---
"
" They are rather deathy.
---
Now I'll be more inter-
 esting, and.
---
you see some loose play-- giving all the
 cuts and points, infantry and cavalry, quicker than
 lightning,
---
You are
 my antagonist, with this difference from real warfare,
.
---
that I shall miss you every time by one hair's breadth,
 or perhaps two
---
you do n't flinch
---
, whatever you
 do
---
"
 I'll be sure not to!"
---
whether you have pluck enough
 to let me do what I wish
---
" Now just to learn, I'll give you a preliminary
 test."

---
the next thing of which was.
---
All was as quick as electricity.

---
" Have you run me through?--
---
no, you have
 not!
---
Whatever have you done!"

---
" I have not touched you.
---
" It
 was mere sleight of hand.
---
The sword passed behind
 you.
---
Now you are not afraid
---
, are you?
---
if
 you are
---
Because l ca n't perform.
---
I give my word that l will
 not only not hurt you, but not once touch you."

---
" I do n't think.
---
I am afraid
---
You are quite sure you
 will not hurt me?"

---
" Is the sWord very sharp?"

---
which seemed
 everywhere at once, and yet nowherre specially
---
These
 circling gleams were accompanied by a keen rush that
 was almost a whistling--.
---
Never since the broadsword became the national
 weapon
---
that had it been
 possible for the edge of the sword
---
wherever it flew past
---
,
 half turned away,
---
The
 hissing of the sword had ceased, and
---
That outer loose lock of hair wants tidying.
---
: I'll do
 it for you."

---
The lock droped to the ground.

---
" You did n't flinch a
 shade's thickness.
---
" It was.
---
because I did n't expect it
---
O, you have
 spoilt my hair!"

---
No-- no! I am afraid of you!
---
-- indeed I am
---
" I wo n't touch you at all-- not even your hair.
---
I
 am only going.

---
that caterpillar settling on you
---
It appeared.
---
that a caterpillar had come from the
 fern and
---
There it is,."
---
said the sargeant,.

---
The caterpillar was spitted upon its point.

---
" Why, it is magic!"
---
I merely gave point to your
 bosom."

---
where the caterpillar was, and
---
" But how could you chop off a curl of my hair with
 a sword that has no edge?"

---
This sword will shave like a razor.

---
" But you said before beginning that it was blunt and
!"

---
" That was.
---
you to stand still, and
---
The risk of injuring you through your
 moving was too great not to force me to tell you a
 fib to escape it."

---
" I have been within an inch of my
 life, and!"

---
" More precisely speaking, you have been within half
 an inch of being pared alive two hundred and ninety- five
 tinies."

---
" Cruel, cruel,' tis of you!"
" You have been perfectly safe, nevertheless.
---
My
 sword never errs."
---
overcome by a hundred tumultuous feel-
 ings resulting from the scene
---
I must leave you now.
---
And I'll
 venture."

---
I must be leaving you

CHAPTER XXIX



 PARTICULARS OF A TWILIGHT WALK


 WE now see.
---
Weakness is doubly weak by being new.

---
Though in one sense a woman of the world, it was.
---
, after
 all, that world of daylight coteries and green carpets
 wherein cattle form the passing crowd and
---
where a quiet family of rabbits or hares lives
 on the other side of your party- wall, where your neigh-
 bour is everybody in the tything, and where calculation
 formulated self- indulgence of bad, nothing at all
---
they never were
---
Had
 distinctly
 worded( and, they would
 only have amounted to such a matter.

---
though warm as
 summer it was fresh as spring.
---
,
 whose defects were patent to the blindest, and
---
whose
 vertues were as metals in a mine.

---
The difference between love and respect was.
---
which
 nearly obscured it
---
It was a result which paralleled
 the oft- quoted observation of Hippocrates concerning
 physical pains.

---
An opportunity occurred one evening.
---
gone for a short walk by a path through the neighbour-
 ing cornfields
---
It was dusk.

---
who had not
 been far a- field that day
---
The wheat was now tall, and
---
the path was narrow
---
;
 thus the way was quite a sunken groove between the
 embowing thicket on either side.
---
Two persons could
 not walk abreast without damaging the crop, and
---
" You are taking a
 walk too.
---
" I thought
---
I would come,
---
as it is rather
 late
---
I am not very fearful."

---
" O no; but there are bad characters about."

---
" I never meet them."

---
once the scheme broke
 down
---
that this was rather a
 clumsy way, and
---
who would naturally come
---
And, too-- I mean
---
I, I'll go
---
I do n't quite understand
---
I meant on account of the wedding which they say
 is likely to take place between you and him.
---
They say.
---
what is not true
---
No marriage is likely to take place between us."

---
what people say
---
putting aside, I never in my life
 saw
---
" Since this subject has been mentioned."
---
I am glad of the opportunity of
 clearing up a mistake which is very common and very
 provoking
---
But I have given
 him no distinct answer.
---
As soon I shall
 do so; and
---
the answer will be."

---
" People are full of mistakes, seemingly."

---
" They are."

---
The other day they said
---
you almost proved
---
that you were not
---
; lately they
 have said, and
---
that you be not
---
you straightway begin

---
That I am
---
, I suppose."

---
you mean
---
" Well, I hope."

---
they speak the truth
---
They do, but.
---
I wish.
---
you had

---
" Did any one tell you?"

---
" Then it appears to me.
---
" Yet I must say
.
---
" I can not see.
---
what this has
---
" I believe.
---
And I
 can not help.
---
I do n't say
---
as I have fancied
---
-- I
 pray to God.
---
since we do n't exactly
 know
---
I like soldiers, but
---
this one I do not like."
---
when
 you see
---
that has come to the dogs
---
detained by a window- pane ever
 pulsed
---
I say.
---
-- I say again--
---
that it does n't become you
---
I know this
---
I never
 did certainly."

---
" The reason of that is."
---
It was
---
as re-
 garded itself
---
that had preceded it
---
I only mention this.
---
that at any rate I would wish:

---
beyond that I put it aside
---
I have lost in the race for
 money and good things, and
---
I am not such a fool, and
---
' ee now I am poor
---
you have got alto-
 gether above me.
---
But Bathsheba, dear mistress, this
 I beg you--
---
A TWILIGHT WALK
 should be more discreet in your bearing towards this
 soldier."

---
Are ye not more to me than my own affairs, and
 even life!"
---
I am
 six years older than you, and
---
I do beg of' ee
---
before it is too late
---
" I wish."
---
you to go elsewhere
---
I do n't want you
---
-- I beg you!"

---
" That's nonsense."
---
" This is the
 second time you have pretended to dismiss me; and
?"

---
what's the use o' it
---
You shall go, sir--!
---
your lecturing I
 will not hear
---
I am mistress here."

---
" Go, indeed-- what folly will you say next?
---
when you know
---
that a
 short time ago my position was as good as yours
---
Upon
 my life, Bathsheba, it is too barefaced.
---
You know, too,
.
---
that I ca n't go without putting things in such a strait as
 you would n't get out of
---
I ca n't tell when
---
Unless, indeed,
 you'll promise.
---
I'll go at once."

---
if you'll
 promise that
---
" I shall have no bailiff
---
; I shall continue.
---
" Very well, then; you should be thankful to me for
 biding.
---
How would the farm go on with nobody to
 mind it but a woman?
---
But mind this, I do n't wish
" ee to feel you owe me anything.
---
What I do
---
,
 I do.
---
Sometimes I say.
---
I should be as glad as a bird to
 leave the place-- for
---
I'm content to be a
 nobody
---
I was made for better things.
---
However, I
 do n't like,....
---
your concerns going
---
as they
 must
---
if you keep in this mind
---
I hate, but, upon my life
---
, your provok-
 ing ways make!
---
I own to being rather interfering.
---
But
 you know well enough too well, and!"

---
how it is, and
---
It is more than probable.
---
more
 distinctly," Will you leave me alone now
---
I do n't
 order it as a mistress--"

---
I
 expect
---
you not to be so uncourteous as to refuse
---
that the request should have come at this
 moment,
---
for the strife was over
---
they were on a
 most desolate hill, far from every human habitation, and

---
the hour was getting late.
---
a good two hundred yards
 were between the lovers and himself
---
that
 the little gallery door alluded to
---
it stood, and.
---
The pale lustre yet hanging
 in the north- western heaven
---
was sufficient to show that
 a sprig of ivy had grown from the wall across the door
 to a length of more than a foot, delicately tying the
 panel to the stone jamb.
---
CHAPTER XXX



 HOT CHEEKS AND TEARFUL EYES


 HALF an hour later
---
which did not come to light till a long time
---
it was only on the chance of.

---
A dialogue was going
 on in the kitchen, and
---
Twill be a gallant life, but
---
I."
" Well, I wish."

---
too much womanly
 redundance of speech to leave alone
---
what was said
---
till
 it died the natural death of unminded things
---
Who are you speaking of
---
There was a pause.
---
before anybody replied
---
What was passing
---
was a bit of a
 word about yourself,
---
" I thought so!
---
Maryann and Liddy and Temper-
 ance-- now I forbid you.
---
You
 know
---
not I. Every-
 body knows.
---
" We know."
---
you do
---
and so do we
 all."

---
" said Maryann.

---
Maryann-- O you perjured
---
How can you
 speak that wicked story!"
---
, you did.
---
Yes, Maryann, you know it!"

---
so did you.
---
What is it to me?

---
You know.
---
it is nothing
---
; I don"t
!"

---
you'll be dismissed
 instantly
---
" I am sorry we mistook you so
---
I see you do n't now
---
" People always
 say.
---
I'll make answer hencefor'ard,

---
";"
 I'll say it out in plain black and white."

---
" O Liddy, are you such a
 simpleton?
---
Ca n't you read riddles?
---
Ca n't you see?

---
Yes; you must be a blind thing, Liddy
---
" I must let it out to
 somebody
---
; it is wearing me away!
---
Do n't you yet know
 enough of me?
---
O God, what a lie it was!
---
Heaven and my
 Love forgive me.
---
And do n't you know?
---
who loves at all
---
when it is

---
There, go out of the room;
 I want."

---
; that it is all lies
---
" Put, miss, how can I say!
---
How can you have the cruel
 heart?
---
what they say
---
that
 you are
---
But I'LL see if you or anybody else in the
 village, or town either, dare do such a thing!"
---
I do n't-- I know!"
---
it is not true
---
I suppose.
---
you only agree with me like that
---
Do you
 hear?"

---
" And you do n't believe?"

---
I do n't know."
---
If I say!
---
No, you don"t believe me;
 and
---
if I say Yes, you rage at me
---
you do n't believe it--
---
you do n't
---
" I do n't believe."
"
---
as they make out
---
My poor life and heart,
 how weak I am!"
---
O, how I wish!
---
I shall never forgive God for making me a
 woman, and."
---
dearly am I beginning
---
if you
 repeat anywhere a single word of what l have said to
 you inside this closed door
---
" Mind this, Lydia Smallbury,, I'll never trust you, or love
 you, or!"

---
I do n't want.
---
I do n't
 wish
---
if you please
---
And,, I'll go at the
 end of the harvest, or this week, or to- day....
---
I do n't
 see!"
---
that I deserve and
---
" No, no, Liddy; you must stay!
---
" You must not notice.
---
my being in a
 taking just now
---
You are not as a servant
---
-- you are a
 companion to me.
---
Dear, dear-- I do n't know'!
---
what I
 am doing since this miserable ache o
---
my heart has
 weighted and!
---
What shall I come
 to!
---
I suppose.
---
I shall get further and further into
 troubles
---
I wonder sometimes.
---
if I am doomed
---
I am friendless enough
---
, God knows!"

---
" I wo n't notice anything, nor
---
will I leave you!"
---
all was smooth
 again.

---
" I do n't often cry,?
---
do I, Lidd
---
but you have made
.
---
tears come into my eyes
---
wo n't you
---
" I will, miss, indeed."

---
you know
---
I am afraid
---
that's.
---
how I am
---
them
 know
---
I'll always be your
 friend."
---
which seems
---
" I think"

---
God likes us,
---
do n't you?
---
" Indeed I do."

---
" And, dear miss, you won"t harry me and storm at
 me
---
, will you?
---
because you seem, and
---
it frightens me!
---
Do you know,."

---
I fancy

---
do you?
---
I hope
---
that' tis getting on that way sometimes.
---
I wish
---
I had
---
who was
---
The arrangement
 was.

---
that they were
---
everything carefully locked up for
 the night
---
though all beneath
 was dry as ever
---
Freshness was exhaled in an essence
 from the varied contours of bank and hollow,; and
---
as if the
 earth breathed maiden breath
---
the pleased birds
 were hymning to the scene.
---
that this midsummer season
 allowed
---
how the day was retreating, and
---
how
 the time of deeds was quietly melting into the time of
 thought
---
even when it involves
 another person's possible blight
---
But the argument now came
 back as sorry gleams from a broken mirror.
---
The dis-
 covery was no less a scourge than a surprise.

---
till they were less than a stone's throw
 apart
---
" Oh; is it you, Mr. Boldwood?
---
who have the power of reproaching in silence

---
Those may find.
---
it a means more effective than words
---
There
 are accents in the eye which are not on the tongue, and

---
more tales come from pale lips.

---
It is both the grandeur and the pain of the remoter
 moods.
---
that they avoid the pathway of sound
---
Bold-
 wood's look was unanswerable.

---
What, are
 you afraid of me
---
Why should you say that?"
---
I fancied."
---
you looked so
---
" And it is most
 strange, because of its contrast with my feeling for you.

---
" You know."
---
what that feeling is
---
No dismissal
 by a hasty letter affects that."

---
I wish.
---
you did not feel so strongly about me
---
" It is generous of you, and more than I
 deserve, but
---
I must not hear it now."

---
What do you think, then?

---
I have
---
I am not, and
---
that's enough.
---
Your letter
 was excellently plain.
---
I want
---
you to hear nothing--
 not I."

---
" Bathsheba-- darling-- is it final indeed?"

---
" Indeed it is."

---
" God's sake, yes-- I am come to that low,
 lowest stage--!
---
I am beyond myself about this, and.
---
I do supplicate to you.
---
I wish; but
---
you knew
---
what is in
 me of devotion to you
---
it is impossible, that.
---
" I do n't throw you off-- indeed, how can I?
---
I never
 had you."
---
" But there was a time when you turned to me,
!
---
before I thought of you
---
I do n't reproach you, for

---
even now I feel.
---
that I should have lived in
---
if you had not attracted me
 by that letter
---
you call it
---
that the ignorant and cold darkness
-- valentine-- would have been
 worse than my knowledge of you,
---
though it has brought
 this misery
---
I say
---
But,, there was a time when I knew
 nothing of you, and.
---
you
 drew me on
---
if you say
---
And you gave me no en-
 couragement
---
, I can not but contradict you."

---
What you call encouragement
---
" was the childish
 game of an idle minute.
---
I have bitterly repented of it
 -- ay, bitterly, and in tears.
---
Can you still go on re-
?"

---
" I do n't accuse you of it--
---
I deplore it.
---
I took for
 earnest
---
what you insist
---
was jest, and
---
now this that I
 pray
---
you say
---
to be jest is awful, wretched earnest.
---
Our
 moods meet at wrong places.
---
I wish!
---
your feeling was
 more like mine, or
---
O,
 could I but have foreseen the torture that trifling trick
 was going to lead me into, how I should have cursed
 you; but only having been able to see it since
---
, I can not
 do that, for I love you too well!
---
But it is weak, idle
 drivelling to go on like this....
---
it is.
---
that makes this denial so hard
 to bear
---
How nearly you promised me!
---
But I do n't
 speak now, and because of my pain
---
you grieve

---
to move your heart make; it is no use, that.
---
I must bear it
---
;
 my pain would get no less by paining you."

---
But I do pity you-- deeply-- O so deeply
---
Your dear
 love, Bathsheba, is such a vast thing beside your pity,
.
---
that the loss of your pity as well as your love is no great
 addition to my sorrow, nor
---
O sweet-- how dearly you
 spoke to me behind the spear- bed at the washing- pool,
 and in the barn at the shearing, and that dearest last
 time in the evening at your home!
---
Where are your
 pleasant words all gone-- your earnest hope to be able
 to love me?
---
Where is your firm conviction?
---
that you
 would get
---
" Mr. Bold-
 wood, I promised you nothing
---
I was bound,
.
---
if l would not be a graceless shrew
---
Yet each of those
 pleasures was just for the day-- the day just for the
 pleasure.
---
I to know?
---
that was death to you
---
One
 thing is sure
---
: you were all but mine, and
---
now you are
 not nearly mine.
---
Everything is changed, and
---
You were nothing to me once,
 and
---
I was contented
---
; you are now nothing to me again,
 and
---
how different the second nothing is from the first!

---
Would to God you had never taken me up,!"

---
since it was

---
which would insist upon supplying unbidden emotions
 in stronger and stronger current
---
I did not take you up--
---
I can endure
---
I am in
 the wrong, if you will only tell it me gently!
---
sir,
 will you not kindly forgive me, and?"

---
If I have lost
---
,
 how can I be?
---
as if I had won
---
Heavens you must be
 heartless quite!
---
Had I known
---
what a fearfully bitter
 sweet this was
---
, how would I have avoided you,
 and, and.
---
I tell you
 all this, but!
---
what do you care
---
You do n't care."

---
as they came
---
dearest, I am wavering even now between
 the two opposites of recklessly renouncing you, and
.
---
that you have
 and
---
it be
---
as it was
---
that
 you only wrote
---
that refusal to me in fun-- come
---
" It would be untrue, and painful to both of us.
---
You
 overrate my capacity for love.
---
I do n't possess half
 the warmth of nature you believe me to have.
---
An un-
 protected childhood in a cold world has beaten gentle-
 ness out of me."

---
, it wo n't
 do as a reason
---
you
 would have.
---
me believe
---
It is n't.
---
because you
 have no feeling in you that you do n't love me
---
You
 naturally would have--
---
me think so
---
you would hide from
.
---
that you have a burning heart like mine
---
You have
 love enough, but
---
it is turned into a new channel.
---
I
 know where."

---
what had occurred
---
your inclination was
---
when next I should have come to you
---
to have me;
 your answer
 would have been Yes.
---
Can you deny it
---
-- I ask,?"

---
can
 you deny it
---
I can not
---
" I know.
---
you can not
---
when nobody would have been grieved
---
when nobody
 would have been set tale- bearing
---
till I blush shamefuly for my folly
---
I have lost my
 respect, my good name, my standing--,.
---
I have no further claim upon you.

---
As for me, I had.
---
I am now ashamed.

---
if I had got, and
---
the dishonour not known, and!
---
my position
 kept
---
, it is gone, and.
---
you knew
---
" All the time-- how very well you knew--
.
---
that your new freak was my misery
---
Dazzled by brass
 and scarlet--
---
" You are taking too much
 upon yourself!
---
" Everybody is
 upon me -- everybody.
---
It is unmanly!
---
I have nobody in the world; but
---
no mercy is shown.
---
if a
 thousand of you sneer and
---
Yet say things against me, I WILL
 NOT be put down!"

---
Do you hear.
---
I am nothing to you.
---
me go on
---
" I shall not."

---
" I am not ashamed to speak the truth."

---
Whilst I would have

---
" given worlds to touch your hand, you have let and!
---
a rake come
 in without right or ceremony
---
Heaven's
 mercy-- kiss you!...
---
which outline and consistency entirely disappear
---
The
 impending night appeared.

---
, that will I
---
I'll horsewhip.
---
I've been

---
I hope.
---
I pray.
---
for I may be tempted
 beyond myself
---
who had been standing motionless as a
 model all this latter time
---
which
 had just passed away
---
The
 least spark would kindle the farmer's swift feelings of rage
 and jealousy
---
; it might
 take the direction of derision, and
---
But now there was no reserve.
---
Above the
 dark margin of the earth appeared foreshores and promontor-
 ies of coppery cloud,.
---
Amaranthine glosses came over them then,
 and
---
HORSES TRAMPING


.
---
THE village of Weatherbury was quiet
---
as the graveyard
 in its midst, and the living were lying well nigh as still
 as the dead
---
The church clock struck eleven.
---
The
 air was so empty of other sounds that the whirr of the
 clock- work immediately before the strokes was distinct,
 and so was also the click of the same at their close.

---
The notes flew forth with the usual blind obtuseness
 of inanimate things-- flapping and rebounding among
 walls, undulating against the scattered clouds, spreading
 through their interstices into unexplored miles of space.

---
to- night
 occupied only by Maryann,.

---
A few minutes after eleven had struck
---
It led to a dream, and the dream to an
 awakening, with an uneasy sensation.
---
that something
 had happened
---
The paddock abutted on this end of the
 building, and
---
The figure seized the
 horse by the forelock, and.
---
Two varieties only of humanity could have entered
 the paddock with the ghostlike glide of that mysterious
 figure.
---
the comer could be no less than a thief, who
 might probably have known the weakness of the house-
 hold on this particular night, and.
---
, there were gipsies in!

---
who had been afraid to shout in the robber's
 presence
---
Maryann,, having seen had no fear.
---
together they went to the paddock.
---
Beyond all
 doubt the horse was gone.
"
---
They listened.
---
Distinct upon the stagnant air came
.

---
the sounds of a trotting horse passing up Longpuddle
 Lane-- just beyond the gipsies' encampment in Weather-
 bury Bottom
---
" That's."
---
" How I
 wish!"

---
it had happened
---
none
 of us had been answerable
---
" We must ride after."
---
what we do
---
Yes,
 we'll follow."

---
Faith, I do n't see how."
---
" All our
 horses are too heavy for that trick except little Poppet,
 and."

---
we only had
---
that
 pair over the hedge we might do something
---
till I come hither again
---
" said Maryann.

---
" I know."

---
" Where did you find' em?
---
I knew
---
where they were kept
---
Coggan, you can ride
?
---
there's no time to look for saddles.
---
when the halters
 were dexterously slipped on
---
Having neither bit nor
 bridle, Oak and Coggan extemporized the former by
 passing the rope in each case through the animal's
 mouth and looping it on the other side.
---
when they ascended to the gate and
---
taken by Bathsheha's horse and the robber
---
Whose vehicle the horse had been harnessed to.

---
Weatherbury Bottom was reached in three or four
 minutes.
---
They scanned the shady green patch by the
 roadside.
---
The gipsies were gone.

---
Which way have they
 gone
---
", I wonder?"

---
as God made little apples
---
Jan.
" Very well; we are, and
---
The road- metal grew softer and.
---
more
 rain had wetted its surface to a somewhat plastic, but
 not muddy state
---
They came.
---
" What's the matter?
---
We must try,
---
since we ca n't hear' em
---
The rain had been
 heavier here, and
---
all foot and horse tracks made
---
previous
 to the storm had been abraded and,
 and
---
blurred by the drops
---
they were now so many little scoops of water, which
 reflected the flame of the match like eyes.
---
One set of
 tracks was fresh and
---
had no water in them; one pair of
 ruts was also empty, and not small canals, like the others.

---
The footprints forming this recent impression were full
 of information as to pace
---
; they were in equidistant pairs,

---
three or four feet apart, the right and left foot of each
 pair being exactly opposite one another.
" Straight on!
---
" Tracks like that
 mean a stiff gallop.
---
And the horse is harnessed.
---
Ay,
" How do you know?"

---
The rest of the gipsies must ha" gone on earlier,
 or some other way.
---
You saw?"

---
there were
 no other tracks
---
They rode along silently for a long weary
 time.
---
it now struck one.
---
ex-
 amined the ground again.

---
The fact is
---
, we shall catch'em yet."

---
Again they hastened on, and.
---
When they looked
 again
---
the hoof- marks were so spaced.

---
That's a trot."
---
, I know
---
They pushed rapidly on for yet two or three miles.

---
's see
---
A light was
 and
---
the ex-
 amination made,
" Hurrah!"
---
We shall get them in two miles,
 for a crown."

---
They rode three, and.
---
No sound was, and
---
when they came
 to a turning
---
The tracks were absolutely the only guide
 as to the direction that they now had, and great caution
 was necessary to avoid confusing them with some others
 which had made their appearance lately.
"
---
What does this mean?--.
---
though I guess
---
who, no
 less than the panting horses, had latterly shown signs
 of weariness
---
This time only three were of the regular horseshoe
 shape.
---
Every fourth was a dot.

---
Yes Dainty is; the near- foot- afore."
---
" We'll push on."
---
Although the road along its greater part had been as
 good as any turnpike- road in the country
---
, it was nomin-
 ally only a byway.
---
The last turning had brought them
 into the high road leading to Bath.
---
"
' Twas said.

---
until, against a shady background of foliage,
 five white bars were visible,
---
Hush-- we are almost close!
---
The white bars were blotted out in the midst by a
 dark shape in front of them.
---
The silence of this lonely
 time was pierced by an exclamation from that quarter.

---
It appeared.
---
The
 rays illumined the whole group.

---
Why,' tis mistress- i'll take my oath!
---
where are you
 going
---
We thought-- 
---
What, then, were you
?"

---
" We thought."

---
the horse was stole
---
that I had taken the trap and horse
---
I could
 neither wake Maryann nor.

---
Fortunately, I could get the key of the coach- house
---
, so
 I troubled no one further.
---
Did n't you think?"

---
it might
 be me
---
" Why should we, miss?"

---
" Perhaps not Why, those are never Farmer Bold-
 wood's horses!
---
what have you been
?
---
" But how was we?"
---
if you left no account of
 your doings
---
" I did leave an account-- and
---
you would have seen
 it in the morning.
---
I wrote in chalk on the coach- house
 doors."

---
that I had come back for the horse and gig, and

---
; that I could arouse nobody, and
---
" But you'll consider, ma'am,."

---
that we could n't see

---
that till it got daylight
---
as it was rare
---
Well, I really thank
 you heartily for taking all this trouble; but but Mr. Boldwood's
---
I wish
---
you
 had borrowed anybody's horses
---
Dainty is lame."
---
" Can ye go
 on?"

---
I got down and
.
---
I can manage
 very well
---
I shall be in Bath by daylight.

---
Will you now return, please?"

---
fanned
 by the velvety air of this July night
---
by which they had come
---
" A strange vagary, this of hers, is n't it, Oak?"
---
we keep this night's work as quiet
 as we can
---
" I am of one and the same mind."

---
We shall be home by three o'clock or
 so, and."

---
The first was merely
---
It was a picture full of misery, but
---
It was now dark, and
---
the hour must have been nearly
 ten.
---
No, no; anything but that. Bath-
 sheba was full of a stimulating turbulence,.
---
beside which
 caution vainly prayed for a hearing
---
till the cottagers were in bed, and
---
whenever they
 chose
---
so nobody would know.

---
what initial success we
 have already seen
---
IN THE SUN-- A HARBINGER


 A WEEK passed, and; nor.

---
there were no tidings of Bath-
 sheba
---
Then a note came for Maryann,.

---
The oat- harvest began, and

---
Indoors nothing was
---
to be heard save the droning of
 blue- bottle flies; out- of- doors the whetting of scythes
 and the hiss of tressy oat- ears rubbing together as their
 perpendicular stalks of amber- yellow fell heavily to each
 swath.
---
Drought was
 everywhere else.

---
They were about to withdraw for a while into the
 charitable shade of a tree in the fence,.

---
I wonder
---
who that is
---
" I hope."
---
nothing is wrong about mistress
---
oats being always sheafed on this farm)
---
an unlucky token came to me indoors this morning.

---
l went and
---
it
 fell upon the stone floor and.

---
Breaking a key is a dreadful bodement.
---
mis'ess
 was home
---
the harvest month is an anxious time for
 a farmer, and
---
since I ca n't work
---
; for' a said,
 I'll have a hollerday."
  " A good time for one-- a excellent time.
---
me to read the Pilgrim's Progress, and
---
Mark
 Clark learnt AliFours in a whitlow."
" Ay, and
---
, the other being wrapped in a bandage
---
" How many
 more times must I tell you?
---
when you be eating
---
You'll choke yourself some day
---
what you'll do
---
A crumb of my
 victuals went the wrong way-- hok- hok!
---
, That's what
' tis, Mister Oak!
---
And I've been visiting to Bath
; yes, and l've
 seen-- ahok- hok!"

---
because I had a felon on my thumb
---
they all threw down
 their hooks and forks and.
---
a supplementary hindrance was
 that of a sneeze,.
 " Yes."
---
" Something is
."

---
so that
 you ca n't tell
---
what's necessary
---
" Yes, that's just it.
---
Your mouth is always open, you
 young rascal!"

---
a gnat fly down yer throat
---
Well, at Bath you saw-- --".

---
" I saw our mistress."
---
And bymeby they got
 closer and closer, and
---
then they went!
---
Well, I see our mis'ess
 and a soldier-- a- ha- a- wk!"

---
if ye'll excuse it
---
" For my poor self, I always say."
---
" please God" afore
 I do anything
---
" There's a great clumsy sneeze!
---
Why ca n't ye have
 better manners, you young dog!"
---
" The cider went up my nose!"
---
now' tis gone down my neck,
 and into my poor dumb felon, and."
---
over my shiny
 buttons and all my best cloze!"
" The poor lad's cough is terrible unfortunate
---
said
 Matthew Moon.
---
I
 always was so excitable
---
when my feelings were worked
 up to a point
---
" The Balls
 were always a very excitable family.
---
well, I wish."
---
But
 we be born to things--
---
that's true.
---
Yet I would
---
rather
 my trifle were hid
---
; though, perhaps, a high nater is a
 little high, and
---
at my birth all things were possible to
 my Maker, and
---
Yet there is."

---
a Sermon on the
 Mount with a calendar of the blessed at the head, and
 certain meek men may be named therein
---
"" said
 Matthew Moon.
---
You know'em, Jan?
---
A Quarrenden grafted on
 a Tom Putt, and a Rathe- ripe upon top o' that again.

---
Tis trew', but
 there
---
" I seed,
."
---
our mis'ess go into a sort of a park place
---
where there's seats, and shrubs and flowers, arm- in- crook
 with a sojer
---
" And I think.
---
And they sat there together for more
 than half- an- hour,, and
---
when they came out

---
they looked into one another's faces,."

---
Well,
 what did you see besides?"

---
You are sure' twas she?

---
What will ye say next?
---
that the sky and the earth in the
 kingdom of Bath is not altogether different from ours
 here
---
our good to gain knowledge of strange
 cities
---
Tis for, and,
 so to speak it."

---
the
 water springs up out of the earth
---
"' Tis true as the light." testified Matthew Moon.
---
" I've
 heard"

---
other navigators say the same thing.
---
" They drink nothing else there."
---
how they swaller it down
---
"
" Well, it seems a barbarian practice enough to us,
 but
---
I daresay.
---
the natives think nothing o' it
---
" said
 Matthew.

---
No- i own to a blot there in Bath-- a true blot.

---
God did n't provide'em with victuals as well as(-
 and."

---
I could n't get over at all
---
it must be a curious people that live
 therein."

---
", you say?
---
how handsome they looked.
---
You
 could see'em all the length of the street."

---
And then I went into Griffin's to hae my boots
 hobbed, and.

---
then I went to Riggs's batty- cake shop,
 and
---
, that were all but blue- mouldy, but not quite
---
whilst I was chawing'em down
---
And I walked on and
 seed a clock with a face as big as a baking trendle-- --"
" But that's nothing to do with mistress!.
---
If you excites me
---
",
 perhaps you'll bring on my cough, and
---
then I sha n't be
 able to tell ye nothing."

---
And there were great large houses, and more
 people all the week long than at Weatherbury
---
And I went to grand
 churches and chapels.
---
And how the parson would pray!

---
so excellent well!-- Ah yes, I wish
---
I lived
 there
---
" Our poor Parson Thirdly ca n't get no money."
---
said  Matthew Moon, thoughtfully.

---
I do n't believe
.
---
poor Thirdly have a single one, even of humblest tin or
 copper
---
how unequal things be
---
" Well, that's enough of this.

---
" Oh-- and the new style of parsons wear moustaches
 and long beards."
---
we fokes in the congregation
---
And there's two religions going on in the nation
 now-- High Church and High Chapel.
---
I,
 I'll play fair;
---
so I went to High Church in the morning,
 and High Chapel in the afternoon
---
" Well, at High Church they pray singing, and
---
they
 pray, and.

---
" Why did n't you say so afore, then?"
---
" Ah." said Matthew Moon,'."

---
" Our
 mis'ess has too much sense under they knots of black
 hair."

---
You see
---
said Matthew, dubiously.
---
you saw

---
Cain Ball, you be no longer a babe and suckling
---
the circumstances
 demanded," and
---
you know
---
what taking an oath
---
is
---
which you say and

---
ye, seal with your blood- stone, and
---
the prophet Matthew
 tells us.
---
whomsoever it shall fall
---
before all the work- folk here
 assembled
---
Now,, can you swear to your words?"

---
as the shep-
 herd asks ye
---
" I do n't mind, but
---
I do n't like if that's
 what you mane."

---
can you!
---
" You be asked, and.
---
" No, I do n't!'
---
Tis you want
---
I mane
---
" All is!"

---
that in common
 truth' twas Miss Everdene and Sergeant Troy, but in
 the horrible so- help- me truth that ye want
---
There's."
---
" Cain Ball, you'll come to a bit of bread!"
---
Then the reapers' hooks were flourished again, and

---
the old sounds went on.
---
pretty
 nearly how the land lay
---
when they were in a nook

---
What difference
 does it make?"

---
" That's the very thing I say to myself."
---
A vehicle of some kind was softly creeping along
 the grassy margin of the lane.
---
The tones were natural
 and
---
The carriage came opposite and.
---
The exquisite relief of finding, overpowered all reflection, and

---
All grave
 reports were forgotten.

---
till there was no
 difference between the eastern and western expanses
 of sky
---
the timid hares began.
---
" the passer said.

---
The blind was

---
" My mistress can not see you, sir.
---
The farmer instantly went out by the gate.
---
It was ten
 o'clock at least,.
---
the carrier's spring
 van entering the village
---
The van ran to and from a
 town in a northern direction, and
---
it was owned and
, at the door of.
---
whose
 house it now pulled up
---
The lamp fixed to the head
 of the hood illuminated a scarlet and gilded form, who
 was the first to alight.
" Ah!"
---
But, some
 one opened the door and.
---
this
 person say" Good- night" to the inmates
---
" This was strange.
---
what appeared
---
It seemed.

---
" Just arrived from up the country, I think?"Just arrived from Bath."

---
in which this word was uttered
---
I wish
---
who lives just ahead there-- and
---
you have wronged
---
" I wonder at your impertinence."
---
, you are going
---
it was
 past ten o'clock
---
" Very well, I'll listen with pleasure."
---
somebody or other may overhear us in the farmhouse
 there
---
I may say, too,.
---
that
 I believe
---
You ought."

---
" I suppose.
---
I ought
---
I
 can not
---
I am too poor
---
Previously it had had a devil- may- care
 tone.
---
It was the voice of a trickster now.

---
I may as well speak
 plainly; and
---
, I do n't wish.
---
I intend a
 business transaction with you."

---
I see.
---
we sit down here
---
An old tree trunk lay under the hedge immediately
 opposite, and
---
they sat down.

---
in which this word was uttered
---
I was
---
you came and-- --"
"
---
If I had not turned up
---
If you had not come
---
I should certainly-- yes,
 certainly-- have been accepted by this time.
---
If you had

---
Well, there's too much difference between Miss Ever-
 dene's station and your own for this flirtation with.
---
I ask

---
So all is
---
will you?
---
" I'll pay you well now
---
I'll see.
---
that you do n't suffer from poverty
 in the future
---
I'll put it clearly.
---
as I said
---
you'll
 never make for a moderate and rightful match you may
 make to- morrow
---
you shall take
 fifty pounds with you.
---
when you have told me

---
such a scheme now engaged in
---
Where there is much bias

---
there must be some narrowness, and love, though added
 emotion
---
that was.

---
I like Fanny best."
---
as you say
---
, why I have all to
 gain by accepting your money, and.
---
" Never mind-- do you agree to my arrangement?"

---
" I do."

---
O,
 Troy,, why then did you step in here
 and?"

---
It is over now."

---
" Why should it be over so soon?
---
And why then
 did you come here again?"

---
" There are weighty reasons.
---
Fifty pounds at once,
 you said!"

---
" I did."
---
and here they are-- fifty
 sovereigns
---
You have everything ready
---
"-- it seems.
---
that you
 calculated on my accepting them
---
" said the sergeant,
.

---
" I thought."
---
you might accept them
---
that the programme shall be
 adhered to,
---
whilst I at any rate have fifty pounds
---
" You've only my word."
" l had thought of that, and."

---
if I ca n't appeal to your honour
---
that
 I can trust to your
---
well, shrewdness we'll call it--, and
---
who is willing to be an extremely useful friend
---
A light pit- pat was audible upon the road just above
 them.

---
" I must go
 on and."

---
" I do n't see the necessity of speaking."

---
" It can do no harm.
---
if I do n't
---
It will help you in your love- making."

---
when I am gone
---
" Your tone is mocking."

---
what has become of me
---
" Will you confine your words to that one point?--

---
Shall I hear every word you say?"
" Every word.
---
what you hear
---
The light footstep came closer,.
---
as if the walker listened for a sound
---
" Come to that, is it!"
---
You promised silence.
---
" I promise again."

---
" Frank, dearest, is that you?"
---
" How late you are."
---
Did
 you come by the carrier?
---
I listened and, but
---
it was some time ago,
 and."

---
" I was sure to come.
---
" You knew
---
I
 should
---
, did you not?"

---
" Well, I thought."
---
you would
---
and, Frank, it is so lucky!
---
There's not a soul in my
 house but me to- night.
---
I've packed them all off.
---
so
 nobody on earth will know of your visit to your lady's
 bower
---
I said."
" Capital."
---
when you'll be gone again
---
But, dear me, I. had
---
better
 go back for my bag,
---
because my slippers and brush and
 comb are in it
---
"; you run home, and
---
whilst I fetch it
---
I'll
 promise."

---
I have come
---
said the soldier, mockingly.

---
I want-- more to you!"
---
you see my dilemma
---
what I ought
---
I ca n't, however,
 marry them both.
---
second, you make it worth my while."

---
The move was absolutely unexpected.

---
Well, what do you mean?
---
"" said the farmer.

---
By Heaven,
 I've a mind
---
Devil,
 you torture me!"
---
It is not worth while
---
Indeed it is a barbarous way of settling a quarrel.

---
I shall shortly leave the army because of the same
 conviction.
---
Now after that revelation of,' twould be a mistake
---
would it not?
---
" Better kill yourself."

---
" I'm glad you see it."

---
what
 I arranged just now
---
The alternative is dreadful, but

---
you
 are,
---
Boldwood, imploringly," I'll do anything
 for you
---
How shall I get?"

---
you to see
---
how advan-
 tageous it will be to you
---
" I do n't wish."

---
" I shall soon purchase my discharge, and
---
then-- --"
" But I wish you!
---
It will
 be better for you both.
---
You love each other, and
---
you
 must let."

---
me help you
---
I'll pay it down to
 you on the wedding- day."

---
And am I
---
, if you wish to
---
But I have not much additional
 money with me.
---
I did not expect this; but
---
I have

---
all is yours."

---
I have more with me
---
before I leave you

---
But I must have a paper signed-- --
---
you please
---
Here
 is the sum, and if you'll come to my house we'll write
 out the agreement for the remainder, and the terms
 also."

---
When
 they stood at the entrance
---
In two minutes a light appeared
 in the passage.
---
that the chain
 had been fastened across the door
---
What, did you think
---
I should break in
---
" Oh, no, it is merely my humour.

---
Will you read this a moment?
---
I'll hold the light."

---
" That's the paragraph."
---
A low gurgle of derisive
 laughter followed the words.

---
as I am
---
I have searched everywhere.

---
You say.
---
that I've
 taught you a lesson
---
" I will not;
---
I will not!
---
Anyhow I wo n't have it.
---
But I'll punish
 you yet
---
; mark me, I'll punish you yet!"

AT AN UPPER WINDOW


 IT was very early the next morning-- a time of sun and
 dew.
---
The confused beginnings of many birds' songs
 spread into the healthy air, and
---
the wan blue of the
 heaven was here and there coated with thin webs of
 incorporeal cloud which were of no effect in obscuring
 day.
---
All the lights in the scene were yellow as to
 colour, and
---
all the shadows were attenuated.

---
The creeping plants about the old manor- house were

---
which had upon
 objects behind them the effect of minute lenses of high
 magnifying power
---
the village cross
---
They were yet barely in view of their
 mistress's house,.
---
partially screened by an elder
 bush
---
they paused before emerging from its
 shade.

---
" I fancied."
---
we should know something to- day
---
" I heard
---
wheels pass my door just
 after dark
---
-- you were out
---
" Good heavens above us, Oak,
 how white your face is
---
; you look like a corpse!"

---
Do I
---
" Lean on the gate: I'll wait a bit."

---
They stood by the gate awhile,.
---
That they were married.
---
Why
 had it been
---
It had become
.
---
the horse had

---
:  that broken down, and
---
Just as that imperceptible motion which appears
---
like
 stillness is infinitely divided in its properties from stili
 ness itself
---
In a few minutes they moved on again towards the
 house.
---
The sergeant still looked from the window.

---
when they came up
---
Bain't ye going?"
---
" I'd say
 good morning."

---
-- you need n't spend a hapenny of meaning
 upon it, and
---
since the deed was

---
" A rambling, gloomy house this." said.

---
Why-- they may not be married!
---
The soldier turned a little
 towards the east, and
---
" But it is a nice old house."
---
" Yes-- I suppose so; but
---
I feel like new wine in an
 old bottle here.
---
My notion is
---
that sash- windows should
 be put throughout, and
---
these old wainscoted walls
 brightened up a bit; or
---
the walls papered
---
It would be a pity
---
", I think."

---
A philosopher once said in my hearing
."
---
who worked
---
when art was a living
 thing
---
that the old builders,, had no respect for the work of builders who went
 before them, but
---
as they
 thought fit
---
a
 million of antiquarians ca n't invent a style
---
I am for making this place more modern,."

---
that
 we may be cheerful whilst we can
---
as if inspired by a recollec-
 tion
---
" I once heard, but.
---
I do n't know the rights o't
---
It is of no importance."
---
Well,
 I shall be down in the fields with you some time this
 week; but
---
I have a few matters to attend to first.
---
We shall, of course, keep on just as
 friendly terms as usual.
---
However,
 what is must be, and
---
- you keep it, Coggan
---
Therefore' tis
 well to say ` Friend' outwardly, though you say
` Troublehouse' within.
---
"
" Well- perhaps it is best; but
---
I ca n't
 go further than that.
---
I ca n't flatter, and
---
if my place
 here is
---
whom they had for some time seen in
 the distance
---
A horseman,, now appeared close beside them.

---
" I wonder."

---
if they were wanted,
 and
---
they were
---
the very step of the
 animal seemed significant of dogged despair.
---
the square figure sitting
---
there was something more striking
 in this immobility than in a collapse
---
The clash of
 discord between mood and matter here was forced
 painfully home to the heart; and,
---
as in laughter there are
 more dreadful phases than in tears
---
when the weather was yet dry and sultry
---
The night had a sinister aspect.
---
A heated breeze
 from the south slowly fanned the summits of lofty
 objects, and.
---
The moon, as seen through these films, had
 a lurid metallic look.
---
The fields were sallow with the
 impure light, and
---
the sheep had trailed homeward head to tail, the
 behaviour of the rooks
---
The same evening
 had been confused, and
---
the
 horses had moved with timidity and caution.

---
Thunder was imminent, and,
---
taking some secondary
 appearances into consideration, it was likely to be
 followed by one of the lengthened rains which mark
 the close of dry weather for the season.
---
Before twelve
 hours had passed
---
a harvest atmosphere would be a
 bygone thing.

---
one
 of which stood slightly ajar, and.

---
The central space, together with the recess at one
 end, was emptied of all incumbrances, and
---
this area,
 covering about two- thirds of the whole, was appropriated
 for the gathering, the remaining end, which was piled
 to the ceiling with oats.
---
The dance ended, and on the black oak floor in the
 midst a new row of couples formed for another.

---
I hope
---
Now, ma'am, and no offence, I ask what
 dance?"
---
you would like next
---
said the first violin.

---
" Really, it makes no difference."
---
" said the fiddler,"?"

---
I'll venture
---
that
 the right and proper thing is" The Soldier's Joy"--
 gentlemen all
---
there being a gallant soldier--
 hey, my sonnies, and
---
" It shall be" The Soldier's Joy
---
," exclaimed a
 chorus.

---
" Thanks for the compliment." said."
---
though I have pur-

---
So the dance began.
---
" there can not be, and.
---
It has been observed in the musical circles
 of Weatherbury and.
---
its vicinity that this melody, at
 the end of three- quarters of an hour of thunderous
 footing, still possesses more stimulative properties for
 the heel and toe than the majority of other dances at
 their first opening
---
" The Soldier's Joy" has, too, an
 additional charm, in being so admirably adapted to
 the tambourine aforesaid-- no mean instrument in the
 hands of a performer who understands the proper
 convulsions, spasms, St. vitus's dances, and fearful
 frenzies necessary when exhibiting its tones in their
 highest perfection.

---
The immortal tune ended, and
---
a fine DD rolling forth
 from the bass- viol with the sonorousness of a cannonade,

---
though the others drank without exception
 cider and ale
---
" The sergeant said.
"
---
that I only
 stepped ath'art, and
---
that a heavy rain is sure to fall
 soon
---
that something should be done
---
it will not rain
---
Friends, it is not only the harvest home that we
 are celebrating to- night; but
---
this is also a Wedding
 Feast.
---
A short time ago I had the happiness to lead
 to the altar this lady, your mistress, and
---
not until now
 have we been able to give any public flourish to the
 event in Weatherbury.
---
That it may be.
---
I have ordered
---
It will only do them
 harm
---
:  they have had enough of everything."

---
True-- we do n't wish for no more
---
said
 one or two.

---
" Pooh!" said the sergeant contemptuously, and
.

---
as if lighted up by a new idea
---
they were in bed.
---
Then we cockbirds will
 have a jolly carouse to ourselves!
---
them look elsewhere for a
 winter's work
---
followed by a
 friendly oath from the sergeant
---
It was a large toad humbly travelling across
 the path.
---
it might be better

---
it uninjured
---
as if a brush of varnish
 had been lightly dragged across it
---
During this time two black spiders, of the kind common
 in thatched houses, promenaded the ceiling,.
---
if there
 was one class of manifestation on this matter
---
that, it was the instincts of sheep
---
They were crowded close together on the other side
 around some furze bushes, and
---
the first peculiarity ob-
 servable was.

---
But this was not the most noteworthy
 feature
---
:  they were all grouped in such a way.
---
that their
 tails, without a single exception, were towards that half
 of the horizon from which the storm threatened
---
There
 was an inner circle.

---
outside these
 they radiated wider apart,
---
formed by the
 flock as a whole
---
the pattern not being unlike a vandyked lace
 collar, to which the clump of furze- bushes stood in the
 position of a wearer's neck
---
Every voice in nature was unanimous
 in bespeaking change.
---
Apparently there
 was, and afterwards a cold con-
 tinuous rain.
---
The creeping things seemed.

---
; whilst the sheep knew all about the
 thunder- storm and nothing of the later rain
---
This complication of weathers being uncommon,
 was.
---
All was silent here, and
---
the conical tips of
 the ricks jutted darkly into the sky.
---
There were five
 wheat- ricks in this yard, and three stacks of barley.

---
when threshed would average about thirty
 quarters to each stack
---
750 L.
 Seven hundred and fifty pounds in the divinest form
 that money can wear--
---
if I can prevent it
---
It is possible:
---
that there was this golden legend under
 the utilitarian one
---
All
 was silent within, and
---
The candles suspended among the evergreens
---
had
 burnt down to their sockets, and
---
in some cases the
 leaves tied about them.
---
Many of the
 lights had quite gone out
---
, others smoked and.
---
stank,
 grease dropping from them upon the floor
---
the hair
 of their heads at such low levels being suggestive of
 mops and brooms
---
The glasses and cups still stood upon the table,
.

---
a water- jug being overturned,
---
from which a small rill,
 after tracing its course with marvellous precision down
 the centre of the long table, fell into the neck of the
 unconscious Mark Clark, in a steady, monotonous drip,
 like the dripping of a stalactite in a cave
---
if the ricks
 were
---
The shaking was without effect.

---
where's your thatching-
 beetle and rick- stick and spars?
---
" Under the staddles." said Moon, mechanically, with
 the unconscious promptness of a medium.

---
it dropped upon the
 floor like a bowl.
---
where's the key of the granary?"

---
The question was repeated, with the
 same result.
---
so strenu-
 ously insisted, glass in hand,.
---
that drinking should be
 the bond of their union,
---
who wished
---
that those to refuse
 hardly liked
---
Having from their youth up been entirely un-
 accustomed to any liquor stronger than cider or mild
 ale, it was no wonder that they had succumbed, one
 and all, with extraordinary uniformity, after the lapse of
 about an hour.

---
that the barn might
 not be endangered
---
So unnaturally did it rise.

---
that
 one could fancy it
---
to be lifted by machinery from below
---
Meanwhile the faint cloudlets had flown back into the
 south- east corner of the sky, as if in terror of the large
 cloud, like a young brood gazed in upon by some
 monster.

---
nobody stirred.
---
Mrs. Tall, I've come for the key of the granary,
.
---
Is that you?
---
" said Mrs. Susan Tall, half awake.

---
" Come along to bed, do, you drawlatching rogue--
."

---
" It is n't Laban--' tis Gabriel Oak.
---
I want the key
 of the granary."

---
what in the name of fortune did you
 pretend?"

---
" I did n't.
---
I thought
---
you meant-- --"
"
---
Yes you did!
---
what do you want here?"

---
soon two of these
 heaps of treasure in grain were covered snug-- two cloths
 to each.
---
Two hundred pounds were secured.
---
Three
 wheat- stacks remained open, and
---
there were no more
 cloths.
---
So far all was well.
---
that there was not
 much wind
---
Next came the barley.
---
This it was only possible.
---
Time went on, and

---
the moon vanished.
---
It was the
 farewell of the ambassador previous to war.
---
The
 night had a haggard look, like a sick thing; and
---
which might have
 been likened to a death
---
And now nothing was heard
 in the yard but the dull thuds of the beetle which drove
 in the spars, and the rustle of thatch in the intervals.





---
A LIGHT flapped over the scene,.
---
a rumble
 filled the air
---
It was the first move of the approaching
 storm.

---
The second peal was noisy, with comparatively little
 visible lightning.
---
soon a shadow swept to and fro
 upon the blind
---
Then there came a third flash.
---
Manoeuvres of a
 most extraordinary kind were going on in the vast
 firmamental hollows overhead.
---
The lightning now was
 the colour of silver, and.
---
Rumbles became rattles.
---
Every hedge, bush,
 and tree was distinct as in a line engraving.
---
In a
 paddock in the same direction was a herd of heifers,
 and
---
the forms of these were visible at this moment in
 the act of galloping about in the wildest and maddest
 confusion,.
---
A poplar in the immediate fore-
 ground was like an ink stroke on burnished tin.
---
Then
 the picture vanished,.

---
as it was

---
polished by
 handling
---
the support called a groom used on houses,

---
A blue light appeared in the zenith, and.
---
It was the fourth of the larger flashes.
---
A moment
 later and there was
---
Not a drop of rain had fallen as yet.
---
Under the staddles was
 a long tethering chain,.
---
It was green as an
 emerald, and
---
the reverberation was stunning.
---
What
 was this?
---
The form moved on a step
---
Is that you, ma'am?
---
" Who is there?"
---
I am on the rick, thatching."

---
and are you?
---
I have come about
 them.
---
The weather awoke me, and
---
I thought of the
 corn.
---
I am so distressed about it
---
-- can we save it any-

---
" Do you know?"

---
that the stacks should be seen to,
 and
---
now they are all neglected
---
Can I do anything
?
---
Fancy finding
 you here at such an hour!
---
Surely I can do something?"

---
You can bring up some reed- sheaves to me, one by
 one, ma'am.
---
; if you are not afraid to come up the ladder
 in the dark
---
" Every moment is precious
 now, and
---
that would save a good deal of time.
---
It is
 not very dark."

---
when the lightning has been gone a bit
---
" I'll do anything!"
---
every knot
 in every straw was visible.
---
The rick
 lost its sheen--.
---
the shapes vanished
---
Then came the peal.
---
It hardly was credible.

---
that
 such a heavenly light could be the parent of such a
 diabolical sound
---
At the same moment,
, there was
 more light, and
---
as it were, a copy of the tall
 poplar tree on the hill drawn in black on the wall of
 the barn
---
It was the shadow of that tree, thrown across
 by a secondary flash in the west.

---
The next flare came.
---
There was then a silence everywhere
 for four or five minutes, and the crunch of the spars,

---
the crisis of the storm had passed
---
But there came a burst of light.

---
Heaven opened then, indeed.
---
The flash was almost
 too novel for its inexpressibly dangerous nature to be
 at once realized, and
---
they could only comprehend the
 magnificence of its beauty.
---
It sprang from east, west,
 north, south, and.
---
The
 forms of skeletons appeared in the air,.
---
these were
---
what may be called a shout
---
though no shout
 ever came near it
---
Simultaneously came from every part of the tumbling
 sky; since,, it was more of the nature of a shout
 than of anything else earthly.
---
love, life,
 everything human, seemed small and trifling in such
 close juxtaposition with an infuriated universe
---
It was a stupefying
 blast, harsh and pitiless, and
---
it fell upon their ears in a
 dead, flat blow, without that reverberation which lends
 the tones of a drum to more distant thunder.
---
that the tree was

---
The
 other portion remained erect, and.
---
The
 lightning had struck the tree.
---
A sulphurous smell
 filled the air
---
; then all was silent, and black as a cave
 in Hinnom.

---
" We had a narrow escape!
---
" You had."

---
The darkness was now impenetrable by
 the sharpest vision.
---
They both stood still at the
 bottom, side by side.
---
The storm seems
---
" I think so too."
---
Though there
 are multitudes of gleams
---
The sky was now filled with an incessant light,
 as
 an unbroken sound results from the successive strokes
 on a gong.

---
" Nothing serious." said he.
---
" I can not understand
.
---
no rain falling
---
But Heaven be praised.
---
, it is all the
 better for us
---
I am now going up again."

---
" Gabriel, you are kinder than I deserve!
---
I will stay
 and.
---
O, why are not some of the others
 here!"

---
" They would have been here.
---
if they could
---
O, I know it all-- all
---
They are all asleep in the barn, in a drunken sleep, and
 my husband among them
---
That's it
---
, is it not?
---
I am not certain.
---
" I will go and,"

---
All was in
 total darkness,.

---
there still arose, as
 at the former time, the steady buzz of many snores
---
If
 you'll come back again
---
to put off the immediate and pain-
 ful subject of their thoughts by remarking gently,", miss-- ma'am, and hand up a
 few more; it would save much time."

---
The soft and continual shimmer of
 the dying lightning showed a marble face high against
 the black sky of the opposite quarter.
---
" I suppose?"

---
you thought
---
when I galloped away
 to Bath that night
---
that it was on purpose
---
" I did at last-- not at first."
---
And others thought so, too?"

---
" And you blamed me for it?"

---
" I thought so.
---
Now, I care a little for your good
 opinion, and
---
I want.
---
- i have

---
since I returned, and
---
you looked so
 gravely at me
---
if I were-- and
---
For to die I may die
 soon
---
-- it would be dreadful.
---
that you should always think
 mistakenly of me
---
It was owing
 to circumstances which occurred after I got there that
 -- that we were married.
---
Now, do you see the matter
 in a new light?"

---
I must
---
", I suppose.
---
that I have

---
And perhaps it's no harm,
---
for you are certainly
 under no delusion that I ever loved you, or that I can
 have any object in speaking
---
, more than that object I
 have mentioned.
---
Well, I was alone in a strange city,
 and
---
the horse was lame.
---
And at last I did n't know
.
---
I saw,,.
---
when it was too late
---
But I was coming away,....
---
And I was grieved and
 troubled-- --"
---
And now I do n't wish for a single remark from you
 upon the subject-- indeed
---
, I forbid it.
---
I only wanted
.--
---
you to know that misunderstood bit of my history
---
before
 a time comes
---
when you could never know it
---
You want
 some more sheaves?"

---
the work proceeded.

---
I think
---
you had
---
better go indoors now, you are
 tired
---
I can finish the rest alone.
---
If the wind does

---
If I am useless I will go.
---
But O, if your life should be lost!"

---
" You are not useless; but I would rather not tire
 you longer.
---
You have done well."

---
Good-
 night- i know."

---
you are doing your very best for me
---
which
 had caused
---
It was the vane on the
 roof turning round, and
---
this change in the wind was the
 signal for a disastrous rain.

ANOTHER


 IT was now five o'clock, and
---
the dawn was promising
.

---
The air changed its temperature and.
---
Cool breezes coursed in transparent
 eddies.
---
The wind shifted yet a point
 or two and.
---
In ten minutes every wind
 of heaven seemed.
---
Some of the
 thatching on the wheat- stacks was now whirled fantas-

---
tically aloft, and had.
---
that lay near at hand
---
This done, Oak slaved
 away again at the barley.
---
the twigs clashed
 in strife.
---
The rain came on in earnest, and
---
It was about seven o'clock in the dark leaden
 morning
---
" It is done!"
---
Faint sounds came from the barn, and
---
Figures stepped singly and in pairs through
 the doors--.
---
all walking awkwardly, and
---
The others
 shambled after with a conscience- stricken air: .
---
the whole
 procession was not unlike Flaxman's group of the suitors
 tottering on towards the infernal regions under the
 conduct of Mercury
---
The gnarled shapes passed into
 the village,.

---
one thought upon their
 condition
---
are you this morning, sir
---
" Yes, it is a wet day.
---
-- Oh, I am well, very well
---
, I
 thank you; quite well."

---
" I am glad to hear it, sir."

---
" I am tired.
---
You look strangely altered, sir."

---
I am well enough
---
What put
 that into your head?"

---
" I thought."

---
you did n't look
---
as you
 used to
---
, that was all
---
" Indeed, then you are mistaken."
---
" Nothing hurts me.
---
My constitution is an
 iron one."

---
" I've been working hard,
 and.
---
our ricks covered
---
.... Yours of course are safe, sir."

---
What did you ask, Oak
---
" Your ricks are all covered before this time?"

---
" They are not."

---
" No. I forgot."

---
I
 overlooked the
 ricks this year."

---
Then not a tenth of your corn will come,
 sir."

---
It is difficult.
---
that the
 neglect to repair was abnormal and
 isolated
---
Yet at this very time, within the same
 parish, a greater waste had been going on,
---
uncomplained
 of and disregarded.
---
who had suffered more
---
" Oak, you know as well as I that things have gone
 wrong with me lately.
---
I may as well own it.
---
I was

---
a little settled in life
---
but in some way my
 plan has come to nothing."

---
I thought
---
my mistress would have married you,
---
However, it is so sometimes, and."
---
nothing
 happens
---
that we expect
---
I daresay."
---
I am a joke about the parish
---
" O no-- I do n't think that."
 --
---
But the real truth of the matter is.
---
No
 engagement ever existed between me and Miss Ever-
 dene.
---
People say so, but
---
it is untrue!"
---
"" I
 am weak and foolish, and...
---
I do n't know what, and
---
I
 ca n't fend off my miserable grief!
---
I had some faint
 belief in the mercy of God.
---
I feel!"

---
it is better
---
A silence followed.
---
" it
 was made more of by other people than ever it was by
 us.
---
I do feel a little regret occasionally, but
---
Well,
 good morning; I can trust you."





---
what has passed between us two here
---
A CRY


 ON the turnpike road, between Casterbridge and
 Weatherbury, and about three miles from the former
 which pervade the highways of this undulating part of
 South Wessex.
---
I returning from market and.

---
it is usual
 for the farmers and other gig- gentry to alight at the
 bottom
---
which was in some degree
---
if it had n't been for that wretched rain
---
" Yes, I
 should have cleared two hundred as easy as looking,
 my love.
---
Do n't you see
---
", it altered
 all the chances?
---
I once read
---
To speak like a book,
 wet weather is the narrative, and
---
fine days are the
 episodes, of our country's history
---
; now, is n't that
 true?"

---
" But the time of year is come for changeable weather."

---
The fact is.
---
, these autumn races are the
 ruin of everybody
---
Never did I see such a day as' twas!
'
---
a
 drab sea rolled in towards us like liquid misery.
---
before the last race was run
---
you could n't see the horses,.
---
till they were
 almost in
---
The ground was as
 heavy as lead, and
---
all judgment from a fellow's experi-
 ence went for nothing.
---
Horses, riders, people, were

---
Three booths were
 blown over, and
---
the wretched folk inside crawled out
 upon their hands and knees; and.
---
Aye,
 Pimpernel regularly stuck fast, when about sixty yards
 off, and
---
when I saw
---
Policy stepping on
---
, it did knock
 my heart against the lining of my ribs
---
, I assure you,
 my love!"

---
you mean
---
that you have lost
 more than a hundred pounds in a month by this
 dreadful horse- racing
---
O, Frank, it is cruel
---
; it is
 foolish of you.
---
We shall
 have
---
to leave the farm; that will be the end of it!"

---
Now, there' tis again--
 turn on the waterworks; that's just like you."

---
" But you'll promise me
---
wo n't you?
---
" I do n't see
---
why I should
---
if it turns out
---
; in fact, to
 be a fine day, I was thinking of taking you."
" Never, never!
---
I'll go a hundred miles the other
 way first.
---
I hate the sound of the very word!"

---
" But the question of going to see the race or staying
 at home has very little to do with the matter.
---
Bets are

---
before the race begins
---
, you
 may depend.
---
Whether it is a bad race for me or a
 good one
---
our going
 there next Monday
---
But you do n't mean!
---
that you have risked
 anything on this one too
---
There now, do n't you be a little fool.
---
till you
 are told
---
sauciness you formerly had, and
---
upon my life if I
 had known
---
what a chicken- hearted creature you were
 under all your boldness
---
, I'd never have"

---
- i know what.
---
They moved on without further
 speech, some early- withered leaves from the trees which
 hooded the road at this spot.

---
The
 ridge was in a cutting
---
Though the overshadowing trees and the approach
 of eventide enveloped them in gloom
---
Please, sir, do you know
---
at what time Casterbridge
 Union- house closes at night?"

---
slowly--
" I do n't know
---
where you are
---
" But I--"
" Do you hear?
---
" How on earth did you come here?
---
I thought
!
---
you were miles away, or dead
---
Why did n't you
 write to me?"
---
" I feared to."

---
" Good Heaven-- I wish
---
I had more to give you!

---
Here's --  wretched --  the merest trifle.
---
It is every
 farthing I have left.
---
I have none but
---
, you know
---
" I have only another moment."
---
Where are you going to- night?

---
"
" Yes; I thought."

---
You sha n't go there
---
Yes, perhaps for
 to- night; I can do nothing better-- worse luck!
---
Monday is
 the first free day I have; and.
---
I'll bring all the money I can muster.
---
You
 sha n't want
---
; then I'll get you a
 lodging somewhere.
---
I am a brute
 -- but good- bye!"

---
which completed the
 ascent of the hill
---
Do you know
---
"?" said Bath-
 sheba,.

---
" I do.
---
" I thought."
---
you did
---
" I think."

---
you do
---
if you will
---
" The sentence was

---
" Think, and be-- -- completed by a smart cut of the whip round Poppet's
 flank, which caused the animal to start forward at a
 wild pace.
---
it was.
---
A heavy un-
 broken crust of cloud stretched across the sky,; and
---
which
 hung over the town of Casterbridge
---
a distant halo was visible against
 the black concave, the luminosity.
---
If I could only get there
---
Perhaps I
 shall be in my grave before then."

---
A manor- house clock from the far depths of shadow
 struck the hour, one, in a small, attenuated tone.
---
After
 midnight the voice of a clock seems, and.

---
Afterwards a light-- two lights-- arose from the re-
 mote shade, and.
---
A carriage rolled along
 the road, and.
---
It probably contained
 some late diners- out.
---
The face was young in the
 groundwork, old in the finish
---
; the general contours
 were flexuous and childlike, but
---
the finer lineaments
 had begun.

---
The pedestrian stood up, apparently with revived
 determination, and.
---
The road appeared
, and
---
Presently there became
 visible a dim white shape
---
; it was another milestone.

---
This was beside a lone
 copsewood, wherein heaps of white chips strewn upon
 the leafy ground.
---
that woodmen had been
 faggoting and
---
For a few seconds the wayfarer stood with that tense
 stillness which signifies itself to be not the end but
 merely the suspension, of a previous motion.
---
Moreover, as was shown by what followed.

---
that it was-- and
---
The crutches answered well.
---
that came from the traveller now
---
The crutches, though
 so very useful, had their limits of power.
---
Mechanism
 only transfers labour, and
---
the original amount of exertion was not cleared
 away
---
being powerless to supersede it,
; it was thrown into the body and arms.
---
each swing forward became fainter.
---
The morning wind began.
---
which had

---
another milestone
 appeared, and
---
soon the beginning of an iron- railed fence
 came into view.
---
The Casterbridge lights were now individually visible
---
,
 It was getting towards morning, and
---
vehicles might be
 hoped for,.
---
There
 was not a sound of life save that acme and sublimation
 of all dismal sounds, the hark of a fox, its three hollow
 notes being rendered at intervals of a minute with the
 precision of a funeral bell.

---
" The mile is to the
 county hall, and
---
my resting- place is on the other side
 Casterbridge.
---
and there I am!"

---
I have.
---
, then the other, then leaning
 over it
---
ex-
 tremity of feeling lessens the individuality of the weak,

---
as it increases that of the strong
---
I'll believe, and
---
that the end lies five posts for-
 ward, and no further
---
This was a practical application of the principle that
 a half- feigned and fictitious faith is better than no faith
 at all.

---
" I'll pass five more by believing my longed- for spot
 is at the next fifth.
---
I can do it."

---
" It lies only five further."

---
" But it is five further."

---
That stone bridge is the end of my journey.
---
when the bridge over the Froom was in view
---
" The truth is,."

---
that I have less than half a mile
---
Self- beguilement with to be false had given her strength.
---
The artifice showed
---
; that limitation, and not comprehensiveness,
 is needed for striking a blow.

---
The road here ran across Durnover
 Moor,.
---
the lights, herself, sighed, and.

---
as the
 traveller here exercised hers
---
by which these last
 desperate eight hundred yards could be overpassed by
---
demanded by either of
---
But the exertion these latter two
 was greater than to walk erect.
---
The faculty of con-
 trivance was worn out.

---
, Hopelessness had come at
 last.
" No further!
---
it was warmth.
---
what not, it was
 impossible to say
---
Darkness endows the small and ordinary ones among
 mankind with poetical power, and.

---
who was as homeless
---
I  might do it then
---
the dog seemed.
---
what was stranger than that
---
the strong should need
 encouragement from the weak
---
was.

---
that cheerfulness
 should be
---
so well stimulated by such utter dejection
---
it was now.

---
It was evident.

---
Their progress was necessarily very slow.
---
They
 reached the bottom of the town, and
---
the Casterbridge
 lamps lay before them.
---
as they turned
 to the left into the dense shade of a deserted avenue of
 chestnuts, and
---
Thus the town
 was passed, and
---
the goal was reached.

---
Originally it had been a mere
 case to hold people.
---
what was beneath
---
that the grim character of
 showed through it,
---
as the shape of
 a body is visible under a winding- sheet
---
Then Nature, as if offended, lent a hand.
---
Masses
 of ivy grew up,,; and
---
till the
 place looked like an abbey
---
it was discovered.
---
that
 the view from the front, over the Casterbridge chimneys,
 was one of the most magnificent in the county
---
A
 neighbouring earl once said.

---
enjoyed
 by the inmates from theirs
---
This stone edifice consisted of a central mass and

---
two wings, whereon stood as sentinels a few slim
 chimneys, now gurgling sorrowfully to the slow wind.

---
In the wall was a gate, and by the gate a bellpull
 formed of a hanging wire.
---
It was getting on towards six o'clock, and
---
sounds of
 movement were.
---
which
 was the haven of rest to this wearied soul
---
A little door
 by the large one was opened, and
---
These lifted the prostrate figure and.
---
" The Lord knows."
---
There is a dog outside
---
The little procession then moved forward--
---
Thus they entered the house and.





---
which was Sunday,
---
The next day, passed
 nearly in the same manner
---
This was the day before the Budmouth races.
---
suddenly--
" Bathsheba, could you let
---
me have twenty pounds
---
" The fact is."
---
, I want it badly
---
I
 do want it for races
---
there was such
 a volume of entreaty in the words.
---
Only such a few
 weeks ago you said?
---
that I was far sweeter than all your
 other pleasures put together, and
---
that you would give
 them all up for me; and now,
---
wo n't you give up this
 one, which is more a worry than a pleasure
---
me fascinate you by all I can do
 -- by pretty words and pretty looks, and everything I
 can think of-- to stay at home
---
that expresses more than the words it
 accompanies, and
---
which seems
---
as it
 was
---
The money is not wanted for racing debts at all
---
" What is it for
---
" You worry me a great
 deal by these mysterious responsibilities, Frank."

---
Yet
 it was necessary.
---
You wrong me by such
 a suspicious manner
---
" Such strait- waistcoating
 as you treat me to is not becoming in you at so early a
 date."

---
I think.
---
that I have a right to grumble
---
a little if I
 pay
---
we
 proceed to the latter
---
Bathsheba, fun is all very well,
 but."

---
you may have cause to regret
 something
---
I do that already.
---
What do you regret
---
" That my romance has come to an end."

---
" All romances end at marriage."

---
" I wish.
---
you would n't talk like that
---
You grieve me
 to my soul by being smart at my expense."

---
" You are dull enough at mine.
---
I believe."

---
you hate
 me
---
I do hate them."

---
if you set your-

---
's strike a balance with
 the twenty pounds, and
---
" I have about that
 sum here for household expenses.
---
If you must have it
---
I expect."

---
I shall have

---
before you are in to breakfast to- morrow
---
" And must you go?
---
Ah! there was a time, Frank,
 when it would have taken a good many promises to
 other people to drag you away from me.
---
You used, then.
---
But it does n't matter to you."

---
how
 my days are passed now
---
" I must go, in spite of sentiment."
---
apparently actuated by
 NON LUCENDO principles
---
whether or not it was wise

---
" O, Frank, whose is that?"

---
Whose should it
 be?
---
I had quite forgotten."

---
that I had it
---
" I tell you!"
---
I had forgotten it
---
" I do n't mean that--."

---
it was yellow hair
---
"
" That's insulting me.
---
I know.
---
it was yellow
---
Now
 whose was it?
---
I want."

---
" Very well I'll tell you.
---
I was going
---
before I knew you
---
" You ought.
---
"
" I can not do that."

---
" It is wonderful!"

---
" Oh-- ho- i like that!
---
which has

---
It is beautiful hair.
---
People used"

---
that's nothing
---
-- that's nothing!"
---
If I cared for
 your love as much as I used to
---
" I could say."

---
people had

---
You
 knew."

---
what married life would be like, and
---
if you feared these contingencies
---
" This is all I get for loving you so well!
---
when
 I married you
---
your life was dearer to me than my own.

---
I would have died for you--
---
how truly I can say!
---
that I
 would have died for you
---
And now you sneer at my
 foolishness in marrying you.
---
is it kind to me to
 throw my mistake in my face?
---
Whatever opinion you
 may have of my wisdom
---
, you should not tell me of it so
 mercilessly, now that I am in your power."

---
" I ca n't help."
---
how things fall out
---
" Well you should n't keep people's hair.
---
You'll
 burn it,"

---
wo n't you, Frank?
---
There
 are considerations even before my consideration for you
---
reparations to be made
---
";
-- ties you know nothing of If
 you repent of marrying
---
I only repent it
---
You
 do n't repent
---
because you already love somebody better
 than you love me
---
, do you?"

---
" I do n't know.
---
Why do you say that?"

---
" You wo n't burn that curl.
---
; it is pretty-- more
 beautiful than my miserable black mane!
---
Well, it is
 no use
---
; I ca n't help.
---
if you will
---
when I took it from a drawer
---
to- day,, I have

---
" Until never looked upon that bit of hair for several months--
 that I am ready to swear."

---
But just now you said" ties;" and then-- that
 woman we met?"

---
that reminded me of
 the hair
---
" Is it hers, then?"

---
that you have wormed it out of
 me
---
There, now, I hope."

---
you are content
---
" Oh! that meant nothing-- a mere jest."

---
" Can you jest?

---
when I am so wretchedly in earnest
---
I am not a fool.

---
, you know,

---
I do n't want much
---
"; bare
 justice-- that's all!
---
once I felt.
---
Now, anything short of
 cruelty will content me.
---
; it
 had been a glory--.
---
who were the
 slaves of the first goodlooking young fellow who should
 choose to salute them
---
the perception was rather that of self- sacrifice than of
 promotion and honour.
---
there was a certain degradation in renouncing the
 simplicity of a maiden existence--
---
The farmer stopped when still a long
 way off, and.
---
who was
 in a footpath across the field
---
Thus they continued for a long time.
---
Joseph Poor-
 grass now passed near them,.
---
then all three parted.

---
who had seen this pantomime with some
 surprise,
---
" I do n't know for certain; but
---
I should be inclined
.

---
it was from general weakness of constitution
---
' tis said.
---
" Indeed I shall not let!
---
- i shall do it
---
How very, very sad this is!--

---
what suffering was
---
We
 ought
---
There will hardly be time, ma'am, will there?"
" Perhaps not.
---
" When did you
 say?"

---
we must be at the door-- three o'clock
---
Very well- you go with it.
---
A pretty waggon is
 better than an ugly hearse, after all.
---
I ought
 to have said."

---
when I gets to our churchyard gate
---
" I wish.
---
I had known
 of it sooner
---
I thought.
---
,
 I ca n't say,; and
---
for I do n't know
---
as to a lie, why, I
 would n't tell it.
---
That's the short of the story, ma'am."

---
No gem ever flashed from a rosy ray to a white one
 more rapidly.
---
" I believe....
---
You look like a lily--
 so pale and fainty!"

---
" That will do, Joseph
---
; now you may go."

---
' tis put to me so judge-
 and- jury like
---
" Really, mistress, now that, I ca n't call to mind,!"

---
if ye'll believe me
---
what I told you
---
The shrubs and flowers
 were all piled in the waggon,
---
" Whose sweetheart did you say, Joseph?"

---
" I do n't know, ma'am."

---
" Are you quite sure?"

---
was only these
 few words.
---
I was very sorry, and
---
I said,` Ah!?'`
---
died in the afternoon-- that's
 clear enough.'
---
Then I asked, and
---
They then said
---
I had

---
they went.
---
you know
---
" Have you heard a different story at all?'
---
, I assure' ee!
---
" Hardly anybody in the parish knows the news yet."

---
" I wonder.
---
These words were

---
' a is now
---
A's rather a curious item, but a
 very understanding shepherd, and."

---
" I can not but say.
---
that there did, ma'am
---
That will do.
---
you'll be late."

---
Do you know?
---
I can not
 recollect
---
" It was light, ma'am; but
---
so that you would
 hardly notice it.
---
But I have seen.

---
it looked beautiful then
---
there was a strong likeness be-
 tween himself and the other young man
---
Here a high
 gable stood prominent, and.
---
it was covered like the front
 with a mat of ivy
---
In this gable was no window,
 chimney, ornament, or protuberance of any kind.
---
The
 single feature appertaining to it, beyond the expanse of
 dark green leaves, was a small door.

---
The situation of the door was peculiar.
---
The sill
 was three or four feet above the ground, and
---
that the door was used solely for the passage of
 articles and persons to and from the level of a vehicle
 standing on the outside
---
Upon the whole, the door
 seemed.
---
That entry and exit
 hereby was only at rare intervals.

---
that tufts of grass were allowed
---
As the clock over the South- street Alms- house pointed
 to five minutes to three
---
, a blue spring waggon, picked
 out with red, and containing boughs and flowers, passed
 the end of the street, and up towards this side of the
 building.
---
Whilst the chimes were yet stammering out
 a shattered form of" Malbrook."
---
The door then
 opened, and
---
a plain elm coffin was slowly thrust forth,
 and.

---
( We believe, and.)
---
that they do these things more
 tenderly now
---
decent, the
 tailboard of the waggon was returned to its place,
---
both entered the door,.

---
as it had been
---
the
 evergreens around the flowers, till it was difficult
---
what the waggon contained
---
the rather pleasing funeral car crept down
 the hill, and along the road to Weatherbury.

---
The afternoon drew on apace, and,
---
, Poor-
 grass saw strange clouds and scrolls of mist rolling over
 the long ridges which girt the landscape in that quarter.

---
They came in yet greater volumes, and.
---
Then their
 dank spongy forms closed in upon the sky.
---
It was
 a sudden overgrowth of atmospheric fungi which had
 their roots in the neighbouring sea, and.

---
by the time
 that horse, man, and corpse entered Yalbury Great
 Wood
---
, these silent workings of an invisible hand had

---
they were completely enveloped,
, and the
 first fog of the series
---
this being the first arrival of the autumn fogs
---
The air was.
---
as an eye suddenly struck blind
---
its load rolled no longer on the horizontal
 division between clearness and opacity, but
---
The
 waggon and were
 imbedded in an elastic body of a monotonous pallor
 throughout.
---
There was no perceptible motion in the
 air,
---
not a visible drop of water fell upon a leaf of the
 beeches, birches, and firs composing the wood on either
 side.
---
The trees stood in an attitude of intentness,.
---
as if
 they waited longingly for a wind to come and rock
 them
---
A startling quiet overhung all surrounding things
 -- so completely,.

---
that the crunching of the waggon-
 wheels was as a great noise, and small rustles, which
 had never obtained a hearing except by night, were dis-
 tinctly individualized
---
as it loomed faintly through the flowering laurustinus,

---
Not a footstep
 or wheel was audible anywhere around, and
---
The fog had by
 this time and
---
this was the first
 dropping of water from the overbrimming leaves.
---
The
 hollow echo of its fall reminded the waggoner painfully
 of the grim Leveller.
---
Then hard by came down another
 drop, then two or three.
---
Presently there was and the travellers.
---
the rusty-
 red leaves of the beeches were hung with similar drops,
 like diamonds on auburn hair.

---
It was about
 a mile and a half from Weatherbury, and
---
where many coaches changed and
---
All the old stabling was now pulled down,
 and
---
little remained besides the habitable inn itself,
 which, standing a little way back from the road, sig-
 nified its existence to people far up and down the
 highway by a sign hanging from the horizontal bough
 of an elm on the opposite side of the way.

---
Travellers -- for the variety TOURIST had hardly
 developed into a distinct species at this date--
---
some-
 times said in passing, when they cast their eyes up to
 the sign- bearing tree,.
---
that artists were fond of repre-
 senting the signboard hanging thus, but
---
that they
 themselves had never before noticed
---
It was near this tree

---
that the waggon was standing
---
the sign and the inn had been
---
The manners of the inn were of the old- established
 type.
---
Indeed, in the minds of its frequenters they
 existed as unalterable formulae:  E.G.--
 Rap with the bottom of your pint for more liquor.

---
Going down into the kitchen of the inn, the floor
 of which was a step below the passage, which in its
 turn was a step below the road outside.

These owners of the
 two most appreciative throats in the neighbourhood,
 within the pale of respectability, were now sitting face
 to face over a threelegged circular table, having an
 iron rim to keep cups and pots from being accidentally
 elbowed off; they might have been said.

---
" Why,' tis neighbour Poorgrass!" said Mark Clark.

---
" I'm sure your face do n't praise your mistress's table,
 Joseph."

---
" I've had a very pale companion for the last four
 miles.
---
I assure
---
ye, I ha'n't seed
 the colour of victuals or drink since breakfast time
 this morning, and
---
that was no more than a dew- bit
 afield."

---
' Tis
 pretty drinking-- very pretty drinking, and is more
 than cheerful on my melancholy errand,
---
True, drink is a pleasant delight."
---
Well, I must be on again.
---
that I should like another nip with ye; but
---
the
 parish might lose confidence in me."

if I was seed

Where be ye trading o't to to- day

" Ay- i've heard of it.

nobody to pay the bell
 shilling and the grave half- crown
---
" The parish pays the grave half- crown, but not the
 bell shilling,: but
---
because the bell's a luxery
---
However, I
 expect."

---
our mistress will pay all
---
as ever I see
---
But what's yer hurry,
 Joseph?
---
" I do n't mind.
---
ye
 can dream of more with ye
---
" Of course, you'll have another drop.

You feel so warm and
 glorious, and

everything goes on like.

Too much liquor is bad, and; but after all,

many people haven't the gift of enjoying a wet, and

since we be

,
 we should make the most o't."True

the
 Lord
 has mercifully bestowed upon us

we ought.
---
But, what with the parsons and clerks
 and schoolpeople and serious tea- parties, the merry
 old ways of good life have gone to the dogs-- upon
 my carcase
---
, they have!"

---
Well, really, I must be onward again now.
---
what's your hurry
---
" Well, I hope."
---
Providence wo n't be in a way with
 me for my doings
---
I've been troubled with weak moments lately
---
I've been drinky once this month already, and

---
I did not go to church a- Sunday, and
---
I dropped a
 curse or two yesterday

; so I do n't want.

Your next world is your next world,

" I believe.

That
 I do."

---
I do n't go so far as that."

---
I'm staunch Church
 of England
---
" Ay, and faith, so be I." said Mark Clark.

---
" I wo n't say much for myself
---
; I do n't wish to
---
" But I've never changed a single doctrine
---
:  I've stuck
 like a plaster to the old faith I was born in.
---
Yes;
 there's
---
this to be said for the Church
---
But to be a meetinger, you must
 go to chapel in all winds and weathers, and.
---
that chapel
 members be clever chaps enough in their way.

They
 can lift up beautiful prayers out of their own heads, all
 about their families and shipwrecks in the newspaper."

---
They can

"-- they can.

" said Mark Clark, with cor-
 roborative feeling;" but.
---
we Churchmen, you see

it all printed aforehand, or

" Chapelfolk be more hand- in- glove with them above

D'ye think?

No, I'll stick to my side; and!"

I'll fall with the fallen

Pa'son Thirdly will be waiting at the church
 gates, and

I've consumed a good many
 in the course of a long and shady life
---
The minutes glided by uncounted,
.
---
until the evening shades began perceptibly and
---
the eyes of the three were but sparkling points
 on the surface of darkness
---
At that moment hasty steps were heard in the entry,
 and
---
the door opened,
.
---
Joseph Poor-
 grass blinked, and.

---
Upon my soul, I'm ashamed of you
---
as if it were not a member

that
 could be done for

that can neither feel nor, and

, I'd pay for it, money
 down.
---
: why should we hurry?
---
what's not required
---
" We may.
---
" added Mark Clark, emphatically, at once
!

---
while peace and plen- ty I find at my board
---
And,
 With a heart free from sick- ness and sor- row,
 With my friends will I share what to- day may af- ford,

---
them spread the ta- ble to- mor- row

that's the matter with me

All is the affliction called a
 multiplying eye, and
---
that's
---
how it is
---
I look double to
 you
---
i mean
---
-, you look double to me."

---
A multiplying eye is a very bad thing."
---
said Mark
 Clark.

---
" It always comes on.
---
when I have been in a public--
 house a little time
---
I feel too good for England:

---
I ought

then I should n't have

---
that I always
 do say"
---
Please God" afore I do anything, from my
 getting up to my going down of the same, and
---
I be
 willing to take as much disgrace
---
as there is in that
 holy act
---
Have I ever allowed?
---
the toe of pride to be lifted
 against my hinder parts without groaning manfully
---
that
 I question the right to do so
---
I inquire!
---
that query
 boldly?"
" We ca n't say"

---
" Never have I allowed such treatment
---
Yet the shepherd says in the face of that
 rich testimony!
---
it pass by,
---
death is a kind friend!"

---
that neither of the three was in a fit
 state
---
where the vehicle stood,
---
It had gradually become.
---
that the body to be brought and
---
when the interposing barriers of earth and time,
 and a sense that the events had been somewhat shut
 into oblivion

By the time,
 it was quite dark.

which hung between them like
---
The corpse is here, sir.
---
" I have just been.
---
I am afraid it is too
 late now for the funeral to be performed with proper
 decency.
---
Have you the registrar's certificate?"

---
" I expect;
 and
---
I forgot."

---
Then that settles the matter.
---
We'll put off the
 funeral till to- morrow morning.
---
The body may be
 brought on to the church, or
---
it may be left here at
 the farm and.

---
fetched by the bearers in the morning
---
They waited more than an hour, and."

---
which might arise from this delay

---
to no purpose,
" It is unkind and unchristian

" said the parson.
---
" And I will
 arrange.

that the funeral shall take place early to-
 morrow

We must remember

The parson's words spread into the heavy air with a
 sad yet unperturbed cadence, and

that could in any way have happened in
 connection with the burial

The scrawl was this simple one,"

who sat cheerless and alone in the large
 parlour beside the first fire of the season

" I'll sit up for master if you like, ma'am.

if I may sit in my own room and

You go to bed.

It is half- past ten now."

" Oh! is it?"

Why do n't you sit upstairs, ma'am?"

 door.

And we shall be sure to know the rights of it in
 a day or two."

" What is it?"

---
" Oh, nothing connected with you or us, ma'am.

you have heard
---
" I have heard nothing."

---
I mean
---
that a wicked story is got
---
" I do n't believe it! excitedly."
---
And
 there's only one name written on the coffin- cover."

---
And a good many others do n't;
 for we should surely have been told more about it?"

if it
 had been true

" We might or

we might not.

 eyes had worn a listless, weary look-

 would be the worst fact suspected
 after all

Patience and
 suspension of judgement for a few hours were, and

there was nobody.

 be.

That was.

no more
 than these few words,!What is the truth of the story

It would
 be an inexpressible relief.

No further speech would
 need.

Every blade, every twig was still.

The air
 was yet thick with moisture,.

lt seemed better to
 be out of the house than within it, and

There was a light in one window only', and

that
 was downstairs.

The shutters were not closed, nor.

 robbery nor observation being a contingency which could
 do much injury to the occupant of the domicile

It was not.

 know all!"

A few moments passed, and

I know it now!"

that they were asleep,

what, pated any such undertaking at night and alone

which had been bated in suspense, curiosity, and
 interest

the
 breath, was exhaled now in the form of a whispered
 wail:" Oh- h- h!
---
that of dying--
 by which a mean condition could be resolved into a
 grand one
---
which had

In Bath-
 sheba's heated fancy the innocent white countenance
 expressed a dim triumphant consciousness of the pain

---
which thought she,

though it was an inconvenient and awful way

that could not be
 overpassed

Yet even this scheme of extinction by death was out
.
---
I do n't mean
---
yet I hate her a little!

whether my spirit
 is willing or no

I am
 miserable at all this!"

---
for a time the room was silent as a tomb.

whether from a purely mechanical, or from any other
 cause, it was with a quieted spirit,
 and

which had

An instant after, the front door opened and

, steps crossed the hall, and

that somebody in the house had died

" I must go!

I must go!"

who's dead?"

" I can not say.

I want air!"

" But no; stay, I insist!"

then volition seemed, and

The candle was standing on a bureau close by them,
 and.

The
 clashes of feeling in all directions confounded one
 another, and

there was motion in
 none.

" I do.

" It is."

All the strong
 feelings seemed gathered
 together into one pulsation now.

O, Frank, I can"t bear
 it-

i ca n't!

I love you better

You will, Frank, kiss me too!"

---
But this was
 the mood of a few instants only.

When the momentary
" I will not kiss you!"

under the harrowing circumstances, to speak
 out was the one wrong act

which can be

If Satan had not tempted me with that face of
 yours, and

A ceremony before a priest does n't make

A TREE-- REACTION


 BATHSHEBA went along the dark road,.

---
what
 appeared like an impassable thicket
---
that was in reality a
 brake of fern now withering fast
---
But it was with a freshened exist-
 ence and a cooler brain.

---
A coarse- throated chatter was the first sound.

---
It was a sparrow just waking.

---
It was a finch.

---
Then, from the road," With my ra- ta- ta, and my
 rum- tum- tum!"
 It was a ploughboy.
---
They stopped
'.
---
There was another
 flounce, and
---
they came out of the pond, and.

---
which had come
 down from the tree and
---
There was an opening towards the east, and
---
A morning mist hung
 over it now-- a fulsome yet magnificent silvery veil,
 full of light from the sun, yet semi- opaque-- the hedge
 behind it being in some measure hidden by its hazy
 luminousness.
---
Up the sides of this depression grew
 sheaves of the common rush, and here and there
---
a
 peculiar species of flag, the blades of which glistened
 in the emerging sun, like scythes.
---
But the general
 aspect of the swamp was malignant.
---
The fungi grew in all manner of positions
 from rotting leaves and tree stumps,
---
Some were marked with great splotches,
 red as arterial blood
---
, others were saffron yellow, and
 others tall and attenuated, with stems like macaroni.

---
Some were leathery and of richest browns.
---
The
 hollow seemed a nursery of pestilences small and
 great, in the immediate neighbourhood of comfort
 and health, and
---
" There were now other footsteps to be heard along
 the road.
---
the pedes-
 trian came into view.
---
that I know out
---
that I know
---
that, grace that,
 grace that, grace that": -- that I know
---
Other words
 followed to the same effect.
---
; the book was a psalter, and

---
In the worst
 attacks of trouble there appears
---
which is left
---
By this time stupor had given place to anxiety, and

---
anxiety began.

---
A form now appeared upon the rise on the other side
 of the swamp,.
---
half- hidden by the mist, and
---
; there
 came no sound.
---
I am so glad I have found you."
---
" You ca n't come across."
---
It will
 bear me up
---
saying,,", I think."

---
as they burst
 and
---
I ca n't speak above a whisper--
---
However
 did-- --"
" my voice is."
---
" I suppose

---
the damp air from that hollow has taken it away

---
Who sent you--
 anybody?"

---
I thought,.
---
when I found
---
you were not
 at home,
---
that something cruel had happened
---
I fancy

---
just before I came out
---
" we wo n't go home at present, then.
---
we
 walk about in this wood
---
they walked
 together further among the trees.

---
" But you had.
---
better come in, ma'am, and
---
You will die of a chill!"

---
" I shall not come indoors yet-- perhaps never."

---
" Shall I get you something to eat, and something
 else to put over your head besides that little shawl?"

---
If you will
---
, some slices of bread and
 butter, a tea- cup, and some hot tea in a little china jug
" Is
---
" Now we'll walk
 about again.
---
They wandered about the wood for nearly two
 hours,.

---
" I will go and."

---
" Then they think?"

---
I am in my bedroom
---
" You said

---
when I first found you
---
that you might never go home
 again
---
No; I've altered my mind.
---
that is
---
I've thought of it all this
 morning, and
---
I've chosen my course.
---
all of which make up a heap of misery
 greater than any that comes by staying at home--
.
---
though this may include the trifling items of insult,
 beating, and starvation
---
if ever you marry
---
that you ever should
---
-- you'll find yourself
 in a fearful situation; but
---
mind this, do n't you flinch.

---
That's
."

---
what I'm going
---
I knew.
---
you had too much sense to bide
 away
---
May I ask"

---
what dreadful thing it is?
---
that has
 happened between you and him
---
" You may ask; but
---
I may not tell."

---
In about ten minutes they returned to the house by
 a circuitous route,.
---
hope had begun
---
to reassert themselves;" you are
---
to be
 my confidante for the present-- somebody must be-- and

---
I choose you.
---
Well, I shall take up my abode here for
 a while.
---
Will you get a fire,.

---
me to make the place comfortable
---
Afterwards, I want, and.

---
you and Maryann to bring up that
 little stump bedstead in the small room
---
What shall I do?"

---
Hemming handkerchiefs is a very good thing."
---
I hate."

---
needlework- i always did
---
"
" You might finish your sampler.
---
Only the carna-
 tions and peacocks want; and
---
then it could
 be framed and, and."

---
" Samplers are out of date--.
---
No
 Liddy, I'll read.
---
we stowed away in boxes
---
me see-- Night Thoughts,
 and the Vanity of Human Wishes
---
It is a nice dismal one that would
 suit you excellent just now."

---
" Now, Liddy, you've been looking into my book
 without telling me; and
---
I said!
---
you were not to
---
How
 do you know?
---
it would suit me
---
It would n't suit me a
 all."

---
if the others do
---
" But-- --"
" No, they do n't; and I wo n't read dismal books.

---
Why should I read dismal books, indeed?
---
The sun went down almost blood- red that night, and

---
a livid cloud received its rays in the east.
---
Up against
 this dark background the west front of the church
 tower-- the only part of the edifice visible from the
 farm- house windows-- rose distinct and lustrous, the
 vane upon the summit bristling with rays.
---
The
 spot had been consecrated to this ancient diversion from
 time immemorial.
---
, the old stocks conveniently forming
 a base facing the boundary of the churchyard, in front
 of which the ground was trodden hard and bare as a
 pavement by the players
---
, their white shirt- sleeves gleaming in the sun
---
left;
 whilst occasionally a shout and a peal of hearty laughter
 varied the stillness of the evening air.
---
They continued
 playing for a quarter of an hour or so,
---
when the game
 concluded abruptly, and
---
the players leapt over the wall
 and
---
which was also half behind a beech
---
on which the branches
 traced black lines.

---
" Why did the base- players finish their game so
 suddenly?"
---
" I think'.
---
" The lads went."

---
whose
 it was
---
" Do you know?
---
" I do n't.
---
This done
---
There is always an inertia to be overcome in
 striking out a new line of conduct-- not more in our-
 selves
---
, it seems, than in circumscribing events, which
 appear as if leagued together to allow no novelties in
 the way of amelioration.

---
at five minutes before ten came back to
 the bridge at the lower end of the town, and
---
The clocks struck the hour, and
---
The
 quarter went, the half hour.
---
in a bitter mood of indifference con-
 cerning the past, and recklessness about the future,
 drove on to Budmouth races
---
it was now.
---
as we have seen
---
as it grew light enough to distinguish objects
---
The position
 of this having been marked
---
surmounted by a board
 bearing the words
---
who had not yet died
---
I want a good tomb."
---
" I want as good a one,"

---
as you can give me for twenty-
 seven pounds
---
That sum to include everything?"

---
And I want it now at once."

---
" We could not get anything
---
special worked this
 week.

---
If you would like one of these in stock

" it could be

what

The best I have in stock

is this one

"," said the stone-
 cutter,.
---
Here's a marble headstone
 beautifully crocketed, with medallions beneath of typical
 subjects
---
here's the coping to enclose the- grave.
---
The
 slabs are the best of their kind, and
---
I can warrant them
.

" Well, I could add the name, and

---
now it was cleared and.

---
Here now stood the tomb.
---
There were bundles of snow-
 drop, hyacinth and crocus bulbs, violets and double
 daisies, which were to bloom in early spring, and of
 carnations, pinks, picotees, lilies of the valley, forget- me-
 not, summer's- farewell, meadow- saffron and others, for
 the later seasons of the year.

---
The snowdrops
 were arranged in a line on the outside of the coping,
 the remainder within the enclosure of the grave.
---
The
 remainder were dispersed in the spaces between these.

---
, there
 was any element of absurdity.
---
lt was a cloudy, muggy, and very dark night, and

---
as it
 seemed, up to the black ceiling of cloud above
---
presently one came and
---
whereupon the candle sputtered and
---
it being now not far from midnight,

---
the rain threatening
---
until the day should
 break
---
THE tower of Weatherbury Church was a square
 erection of fourteenth- century date,.
---
Of
 these eight carved protuberances only two at this time
 continued.
---
One
 mouth in each front had been closed by bygone church-
 wardens as superfluous, and
---
two others were broken
 away and--
---
which
 still remained open and active
---
a matter not of much consequence
 to the wellbeing of the tower, for the two mouths were gaping enough to do
 all the work.

---
It has been sometimes argued;
 and
---
that there is no truer
 criterion of the vitality of any given art- period than the
 power of the master- spirits of that time in grotesque
---
certainly in the instance of Gothic art there is.
---
Weatherbury tower was a
 somewhat early instance of the use of an ornamental
 parapet in parish as distinct from cathedral churches,
 and the gurgoyles, which are the necessary correlatives
 of a parapet
---
that the hand could shape
---
that a human brain could conceive
---
There was,, that symmetry in their distortion
 which is less the characteristic of British than of
 Continental grotesques of the period.
---
All the eight
 were different from each other.
---
A beholder was con-
.
---
This horrible
 stone entity was fashioned.
---
as if covered with a wrinkled
 hide; it had short
---
, erect ears, eyes starting from their
 sockets, and its fingers and hands were seizing the
 corners of its mouth, which they thus seemed to pull
 open to give free passage to the water it vomited
---
The
 lower row of teeth was quite washed away,.
---
though the
 upper still remained
---
Here and thus, jutting a couple
 of feet from the wall against which its feet rested as a
 support
---
, the creature had for four hundred years
.

---
the rain increased
 outside.
---
In due time a
 small stream began.
---
which
 the water- drops smote like duckshot in their accelerated
 velocity
---
The stream thickened in substance, and.
---
When the rain fell
 in a steady and ceaseless torrent
---
the stream dashed
 downward in volumes.

---
We follow its course to the ground at this point of
 time.
---
The end of the liquid parabola has come forward
 from the wall.

---
The force of the stream had, until very lately,.

---
which had acted as a shield to the soil under the onset
---
These during the summer had been cleared from the
 ground, and
---
there was now nothing to resist the down-
 fall but the bare earth.
---
For several years the stream
 had not spouted so far from the tower as it was doing
 on this night, and
---
such a contingency had been.
---
Sometimes this obscure corner received no
 inhabitant for the space of two or three years, and

---
then it was usually but a pauper, a poacher, or other
 sinner of undignified sins.

---
The persistent torrent from the gurgoyle's jaws
 directed all its vengeance into the grave.
---
The rich
 tawny mould was stirred into motion, and.
---
The water accumulated and washed deeper
 down, and the roar of the pool thus formed.
---
created by the deluging rain
---
The flowers began.
---
The winter- violets
 turned slowly upside down, and.
---
Soon the snowdrop and other bulbs danced in
 the boiling mass like ingredients in a cauldron.
---
Plants
 of the tufted species were loosened,.

---
till it
 was broad day
---
The rain had quite ceased, and
---
the sun was shining
 through the green, brown, and yellow leaves,.
---
varnished by the raindrops to the bright-
 ness of similar effects in the landscapes of Ruysdael and
 Hobbema, and full of all those infinite beauties that
 arise from the union of water and colour with high
 lights
---
The air was rendered so transparent by the
 heavy fall of rain that the autumn hues of the middle
 distance were as rich as those near at hand, and
---
intercepted by the angle of the tower
---
the
 remote fields ap-
 peared in the same plane as the tower itself.

---
The path, instead of being stony as
 it had been the night before,.
---
Beyond
 doubt they were the crocuses.
---
the stream had made
---
The pool upon the grave had soaked away into the
 ground, and.
---
it
 spotted the marble tombstone with the same stains.

---
Nearly all the flowers were washed clean out of the
 ground, and
---
they lay, roots upwards, on the spots whither
 they had been splashed by the stream.

---
any
 observer would hardly have

---
even that
 lowest stage of rebellion needed an activity
---
as it did
---
The sight, coming
, superimposed upon the other dark scenery of
 the previous days, formed a sort of climax to the whole
 panorama, and
---
softened by time
---
now it was
.

---
lt is seldom
---
that a person with much animal spirit does

---
hundreds of times, because the possession of that condition
 would have necessitated a different personality,
---
it seemed.
---
that matters would right themselves at some proper date
 and
---
This very morning the illusion
 completed its disappearance, and,
---
as it were
---
The suddenness was
 probably more apparent than real.
---
which
 just comes short of the ocean surface
---
A coral reef is no more to the
 horizon than if it had never been begun, and
---
the mere
 finishing stroke is.

---
what often appears
---
which has long been potentially an accomplished thing
---
that is
---
Going out
 of the churchyard silently and unobserved-- none of the
 villagers having yet risen
---
for whom a bed had
 been arranged in a small adjoining room
---
They looked curiously at the phenomenon for a time,
.

---
breath-
 ing in the next room, the mistress of the house was

---
though this
 appearance failed
---
that a person was

---
till it began
---
the light vanished,.

---
Almost before the first faint sign of dawn appeared

---
left by the night rain
---
being now
 wet with trembling tears, each
 one rounded with a pale lustre caught from primrose-
 hued slashes through a cloud low down in the awaken-
 ing sky
---
From the trees came the sound of steady
 dripping upon the drifted leaves under them, and
---
, the purl
 of water falling into a pool
---
we've had in the night
---
" Did you hear the strange noise from the church
 yard?"

---
" I heard one strange noise.
---
I've been thinking.
---
it
 must have been the water from the tower
---
"
" Well, that's.

---
what the shepherd was saying, ma'am
---
which I thought
---
But the tower
 spouts, and."

---
we are puzzled,
 for this
---
Are
 you going across to the church, ma'am?
---
Not that I know of.
---
" I thought.
---
you might like
---
The trees hide the place from your
 window."

---
; I think.

---
now all the house knew.
---
that there had
 been some dreadful disagreement between them, and

---
it was futile
---
at which people cease
---
What makes
---
you think
---
which had

 breakfast was over
---
It was nine o'clock,
 and
---
which was invisible from the road
---
Knowing called in the parish
" behind church.", it
 was impossible.
---
its delicately veined surface splashed and
 and
---
that the
 grand tomb and the disturbed grave were
---
such discoveries did

---
Emotional convulsions seemed

---
which was standing by
---
which flowers seem
---
the churchwardens to turn the leadwork at the
 mouth of the gurgoyle that hung gaping down upon
 them,
---
that by this means and
---
the stream might be directed
 sideways,
---
a repetition of the accident prevented
---
who
 lay in the churchyard, remorse
---
which ran to the ridge of a range of hills lying parallel
 with the shore, and forming a monotonous barrier between
 the basin of cultivated country inland and the wilder
 scenery of the coast
---
nearly straight and perfectly white, the two sides
 approaching each other in a gradual taper
---
till they
 met the sky at the top about two miles off
---
Through-
 out the length of this narrow and irksome inclined plane
 not a sign of life was visible on this garish afternoon

---
The air was warm and
---
muggy, and
 the top seemed.

---
, marked only by faint lines, which had a
 semblance of being etched thereon to a degree not deep
 enough to disturb its general evenness,
---
, the sun bristled
 down upon it, and.
---
Nothing moved in sky,
 land, or sea, except a frill of milkwhite foam along the
 nearer angles of the shore,
---
shreds of which licked the
 contiguous stones like tongues.

---
enclosed by the cliffs
---
Inside
 the cove the water was uninteresting to a swimmer,
 and
---
which, un-
 important to craft of any burden, was awkward for a
 swimmer who might be taken in it
---
Many bathers had there prayed for a dry
 death from time to time, and,
---
like Gonzalo also, had
 been unanswered; and
---
Not a boat
 of any kind was at present within sight, but
---
far in the
 distance Budmouth lay upon the sea,
---
as it were quietly
, and
---
beside the town the harbour
 showed its position by a dim meshwork of ropes and
 spars.
---
ceptibly approached the extremity of a spit of land yet
 further to the right, now well defined against the sunny
 portion of the horizon
---
While the swimmer's eye's were
 fixed upon the spit
---
immediately a ship's boat
 appeared.

---
They formed part of a brig's crew, and.
---
what little clothing they
 could spare among them as a slight protection against

---
at no great distance from them,
 where the shoreline curved round, and formed a long
 riband of shade upon the horizon,
---
a series of points of
 yellow light began.
---
where the lamps were
 being lighted along the parade
---
The cluck of their
 oars was the only sound of any distinctness upon the
 sea, and
---
as they laboured amid the thickening shades

---
the lamplights grew larger,,.





---
each appearing
---
until
 there arose, among other dim shapes of the kind, the
 form of the vessel for which they were bound
---
yet
 neither sensation rose at any time far above the level
 commonly designated as indifference.
---
the certainties of that position were and
---
the reasonable probabilities of its issue so bounded
.
---
that no
 reality could exceed for darkness
---
since anxiety
 recognizes a better and a worse alternative, and
---
And then the days of their tenancy of the
 Upper Farm would be numbered.
---
no further objections had
 been raised
---
only one point was clear--.
---
, for that
 matter, very little would be deserved
---
Once out of the
 farm, the approach of poverty would be sure.

---
the less far- Sighted and energetic,
 though more petted ones of the sex, with whom hope
 goes on as a sort of clockwork which the merest food
 and shelter are sufficient to wind up; and, and.

what the speaker said
---
" Yes; that's the young lady

, I believe.

" said the
 the person addressed.

---
" No, it is not true
---
; it can not be true!"

---
The ice of self-
 command was
, and
---
the currents burst forth again, and.
---
" What is it?"
---
Everybody's glance was.
---
that had occurred
---
I want
---
now it had gone again.
---
These appeared.
---
when all was ready
---
who brought
 the tidings, and
---
there was
---
the farmer at once de-
 parted.

---
as if nothing had happened
---
Weather-
 bury by half- an- hour,
---
Somebody
 came to the door,.

---
Well, what is it, Liddy
---
I was thinking."
---
there must be something got for you
 to wear
---
" What do you mean?"

---
" But I suppose"
---
there must be something done for
 poor-- --"

---
Not at present, I think.
---
It is not necessary."

---
" How do you know that
---
" I do n't know it.
---
But would n't it have been different,
 or
---
should n't I have heard more, or Liddy?-- or
---
would n't they have

---
- i do n't know, but
.
---
how it is
---
death would have been different from how this is
---
when two circumstances conjoined
---
The
 first was a short paragraph in the local newspaper,.
---
just as the sun was setting
---
that
 there was
---
Mr. Barker followed
 along the shore in the same direction.
---
dusk had set in, and

---
sufficiently great to
 command a view of the sea beyond, nothing further was.

---
when it became necessary--
---
that the notion was a perverse one
 to entertain
---
that others were
 assured in their opinion
---
When alone late that evening beside a small fire, and
 much calmed down

There was
 the little coil of pale hair which had been as the fuze to
 this great explosion.

No- i'll not burn it

A GREAT HOPE


 THE later autumn and the winter drew on apace,
 and
---
the leaves lay thick upon the turf of the glades
 and the mosses of the woods.
---
which was not suspense
---
which was not precisely peacefulness
---
that it might be

---
though not long gone by
---
which,, seemed.
---
what a gift life
 used
---
it brought
---
, the change, beyond the substantial in-
 crease of wages, was little more than a
 nominal one addressed to the outside world.

---
It sprouted,.

---
which had produced this ruin
 and
---
The strange neglect waste became the subject of whispered talk among
 all the people round; and
---
that forgetfulness had nothing to do
 with it,
---
The sight of the pigs turning in disgust
 from the rotten ears seemed, and

---
Whether it was
---
,
 the farmer proposed at the interview.
---
who was apparently determined by personal
 rather than commercial reasons
---
when the plan would present no difficulty, the two
 farms lying side by side
---
who was the go- between throughout
---
All was harmoniously arranged at last, and
---
we now
 see.

---
the actual mistress of the one- half
 and the master of the other, sitting in their respective
 homes in gloomy and sad seclusion
---
Whatever d'ye think."
---
said Susan Tall,.
---
When I see
---
people strut
 enough
---
, I stand
 dormant with wonder, and
---
It was eventually known
---
it was
 money of a higher quality than mere wages, and
 capable of expansion
---
in a way that wages were not
---
Some were beginning.
---
who clung
 persistently to old habits and usages
---
simply because
 they were old
---
lest facts
 should reveal the wildness of the dream
---
that a
 time was coming--
---
to
 recognize was and
---
that the severe schooling subjected to
---
It would be possible
.

---
" Fearful, did you say?"

---
I merely said."

---
I
 expect."

---
that you shall-- quite natural
---
said
 the strategic lover,.

---
" Yes, yes, I understand.
---
, you conclude-- --"
"
---
You need n't take quite such long with
 your rake
---
, Lydia-- short and quick ones are best.
---
" My mistress did certainly once say, though not
 seriously,."
" Ah, six years from the present time.
---
whatever the lawyers may say to the
 contrary
---
Have you been?
---
" Not I." said."
---
Liddy, you
 need n't stay here a minute later,
---
than you wish
---
I am now going on a little farther.
---
, what was worse.
---
It was
 a singularly fresh and fascinating fact, and.
---
though not
 without its sadness it was pertinent and real
---
Six years were a long time, but how much shorter than

---
never, the idea so long been obliged!
---
that it was pos-

---
this
 patience in delay would afford him an opportunity of
 giving sweet proof on the point
---
Meanwhile the early and the late summer brought
 round the week in which Greenhill Fair was held.

---
This fair was frequently attended by the folk of Weather-
 bury.





---
GREENHILL was the Nijni Novgorod of South
 Wessex; and
---
the busiest, merriest, noisiest day of the
 whole statute number was the day of the sheep fair.

---
This yearly gathering was upon the summit of a hill
 which retained in good preservation the remains of an
 ancient earthwork, consisting of a huge rampart and
 entrenchment of an oval form encircling the top of
 the hill, though somewhat broken down here and there.

---
To each of the two chief openings on opposite sides a
 winding road ascended, and
---
enclosed by the bank
---
the level green space of
 ten or fifteen acres was the
 site of the fair.
---
A few permanent erections dotted the
 spot, but
---
the majority of visitors patronized canvas alone
 for resting and feeding under during the time of their
 sojourn here.

---
who attended with their flocks from long
 distances
---
Shepherds started from home two or three days, or even
 a week, before the fair,.
---
where they fed,
---
occasionally a lambing
 occurred on the road.
---
there was
---
into which
 the weakly ones were taken for the remainder of the
 journey
---
The Weatherbury Farms, however, were no such
 long distance from the hill, and
---
those arrangements
 were not necessary in their case.
---
When the autumn sun slanted over Greenhill this
 morning and
---
lighted the dewy flat upon its crest, nebu-
 lous clouds of dust were.
---
which streaked the wide prospect
 around in all directions
---
These gradually converged
 upon the base of the hill, and
---
the flocks became
 individually visible,.
---
which
 led to the top
---
Thus, in a slow procession, they entered
 the opening to which the roads tended, multitude after
 multitude, horned and hornless-- blue flocks and red
 flocks, buff flocks and brown flocks, even green and
 salmon- tinted flocks, according to the fancy of the
 colourist and custom of the farm.
---
dogs were barking, with greatest animation, but
---
the
 thronging travellers in so long a journey had grown
 nearly indifferent to such terrors,, like a gigantic idol amid a crowd of prostrate
 devotees.

---
though they still
 bleated piteously at the unwontedness of their experi-
 ences, a tall shepherd rising here and there in the midst
 of them
---
These filed in about nine o'clock,
.
---
their vermiculated horns lopping gracefully on each side
 of their cheeks in geometrically perfect spirals,
---
a small
 pink and white ear nestling under each horn
---
Before
 and behind came other varieties, perfect leopards as to
 the full rich substance of their coats, and.
---
There were also a few of the Oxfordshire breed
---
,
 whose wool was beginning.
---
though surpassed in this respect by the effeminate
 Leicesters, which were in turn less curly than the Cots-
 wolds
---
But the most picturesque by far was a small
 flock of Exmoors, which chanced to be there this year.

---
weary thousands had

---
All these bleating, panting, and entered and
---
Alleys for pedes-
 trians intersected the pens, which soon became crowded
 with buyers and sellers from far and near.

---
In another part of the hill an altogether different
 scene began.
---
A circular tent, of exceptional newness and size,
 was in course of erection here.
---
As the day drew on
---
,
 the flocks began,; and
---
they turned their attention
 to this tent and
---
, whose
 soul seemed concentrated on tying a bothering knot in
 no time.

---
, what was going on
---
as the tent was completed
---
As soon the band struck
 up
---
the announce-
 ment was publicly made
---
highly stimulating harmonies, and, Black Bess standing in a con-
 spicuous position on the outside, as a living proof,.

---
If
 proof were wanted, of the truth of the oracular utterances
 from the stage over which the people were to enter
---
How can I help
---
when the folk behind
 push me
---
which was jammed as in a vice
---
There was a silence
---
; then the drums and trumpets
 again sent forth their echoing notes.
---
The crowd was
.

---
that helpless feymels should be
---
as it stood
---
if I
 could only get out of this cheesewring
---
" Do n't ye lose yer temper, Jan!"
---
for I think
---
that
 they be a sinful form of womankind
---
they gradually reached
 the foot of the ladder
---
the sixpence, for admission,, having become
---
that some trick had been played
---
So they all entered, and
---
the cloth of the
 tent, to the eyes of an observer on the outside, became
.

---
such as we observe on
 a sack of potatoes
---
caused by the various human heads,
 backs, and elbows at high pressure within
---
At the rear of the large tent there were two small
 dressing- tents.
---
One of these, alloted to the male per-
 formers, was partitioned into halves by a cloth; and
---
The brig was about to start on a voyage, though
 somewhat short of hands.
---
before they sailed
---
a boat was despatched
 across the bay to Lulwind cove
---
however pleasant a strange condition might
 be
---
whilst privations were easily warded off
---
, it was dis-
 advantageously coarse.
---
when money was short
---
was a frequent subject of curious
 conjecture.
---
but the fact of drawing nearer to Weatherbury abstracted its
 fascinations, and
---
It was with gloom
---
sidered on landing at Liverpool; for was
 an occasional fitful sentiment which sometimes caused
 him as much inconvenience as emotion of a strong and
 healthy kind.
---
At this time-- the July preceding the September in
 which we find at Greenhill Fair
---
the engage-
 ment might afford him a few weeks for consideration
---
It was thus carelessly, and
---
And now the mild autumn sun got lower, and
---
in
 front of the pavilion the following incident had taken
 place.
---
This particular show was by far.
---
The crowd
 had passed in, and
---
" I hope.

---
I was fortunate
 enough to sell them all just as we got upon the hill
---
", so
 we had."

---
" And now you are entirely at leisure?"

---
that I have
---
otherwise I should be going home
---
Have you ever seen the play of" Turpin's Ride to
 York?
---
Indeed, I think
.
---
I've heard
---
, we must remember
---
I hope."

---
they
 can all be believed
---
But Turpin is true
 enough.
---
You have never seen
---
it played
---
, I suppose?"

---
I was not allowed.
---
when I was young
---
What's that prancing?

---
How they shout!"

---
Black Bess just started off
---
", I suppose.
---
Am I right
 in supposing
---
if it is one
---
if you would like
---
to, I'll get a seat for you with
 pleasure
---
I
 myself shall not stay
---
to see it: I've seen it before
---
, whose assistance in such cases was
---
hence it was
---
This feature consisted of one raised bench
---
who were

---
Turpin
 not having
---
The interior was shadowy with a peculiar shade.

---
The strange luminous semi- opacities of fine autumn
 afternoons and eves intensified into Rembrandt effects

---
which came through holes
 and divisions in the canvas
---
the few yellow sunbeams, and spirted like jets of
 gold- dust across the dusky blue atmosphere of haze
 pervading the tent,, and
---
until they alighted on inner surfaces
 of cloth opposite
---
If they see me
---
Here's the devil to pay!
---
" How's that?"

---
Why, there's a blackguard creditor in the tent
---
I do n't
 want
---
" to see, who'll discover me and as sure as
 Satan if I open my mouth.
---
What's?"

---
You must appear now
---
, I think."

---
I ca n't.
---
"
 But the play must proceed."

---
" Do you give out."

---
that Turpin has got a bad cold,
 and but
---
" Anyhow, play or no play, I wo n't open my mouth,

---
me see
---
I tell you."
---
how we'll
 manage
---
, who perhaps felt
---
" I wo n't tell'em anything about your
 keeping silence
---
you can
---
,
 doing what by a judicious wink now and then,
 and a few indomitable nods in the heroic places, you
 know
---
They'll never find out."

---
that the speeches are

---
This seemed feasible enough, for Turpin's speeches
.

---
many or long, the fascination of the piece
 lying entirely in the action; and accordingly the play
 began, and
---
at the appointed time Black Bess leapt
 into the grassy circle amid the plaudits of the spectators
---
where Bess and Turpin are
---
At the turnpike scene, hotly
 pursued at midnight by the officers, and
---
that any
 horseman has passed
---
which could be heard all over the fair
 above the bleating, and
---
when the last sad scene came on,
 and
---
the body of the gallant and faithful Bess had
---
to
 be carried out on a shutter by twelve volunteers from
 among the spectators
---
as some thinkers
 hold
---
If,, immortality consists in being enshrined in others"
 memories
---
, then did Black Bess become immortal.

---
effected by judici-

---
when it was got through
---
the tent was lighted up.
---
yet there was room for
 a doubt.
---
It was now almost dark, and
---
respectable people
 were getting their carts and gigs ready to go home

---
The largest refreshment booth in the fair was provided
 by an innkeeper from a neighbouring town.
---
This was

---
the
 necessary food and rest: Host Trencher( jauntily called by the local newspaper)
---
The tent was divided into first and
 second- class compartments, and
---
In these penetralia were chairs and a table,
 which, on candles being lighted, made quite a cozy and
 luxurious show, with an urn, plated tea and coffee pots,
 china teacups, and plum cakes.

---
which,
 by folding back the corners left a hole the size of a
 wafer
---
lt was too near to be convenient.
---
from which it was easy
 and safe
---
as they had been stirred earlier in the
 day
---
It
 was.
---
even whilst it was
---
" Shall I get you another cup,
 ma'am?
---
before you start
---
I thank you
---
" But I must be going
 at once.
---
I should have gone two hours
 ago,.
---
I had no idea of
 coming in here; but."

---
there's nothing so refreshing as a
 cup of tea,
---
though I should never have got one
---
if you
 had n't helped me
---
as lit by the candles
---
I've some
 private information for your ear alone
---
I can not hear it now."
---
" I'll write it down."
---
Who's the fool
 now?"

---
Nothing could be done
.
---
which rustled in the gloom like
 a pestilent wind
---
Do n't you wish
---
If not,
 I'll destroy it."

---
perhaps it is
 unjust;
---
I can guess.

---
what it is about
---
it is

standing among the
 groups there gathered.
---
It was supposed.

However, the occurrence seemed.

for it had not interrupted a fiddler, who
 had lately begun playing by the door of the tent, nor

THE arrangement for getting back again to Weather-
 bury had been

 it being discovered late in the afternoon and.

It had grown
 twilight, but
---
that there was no cause for uneasiness,

as the
 moon would be up in half- an- hour
---
This, how-
 ever, could not be helped
---
the moon having risen, and

---
the gig being ready
---
as it seemed, for the moon and
---
it
 flooded with light
---
the hill were in appearance on a level
---
, the
 rest of the world lying as a vast shady concave between
 them.
---
Thus they descended into
 the lowlands, and
---
the sounds of those left on the
 hill came like voices from the sky, and
---
the lights were
 as those of a camp in heaven.
---
They soon passed the
 merry stragglers in the immediate vicinity of the hill,
.

The sight
 had

They
 had gone two or three miles in the moonlight,

it was not till a minute or more

O yes I have, or

I have been able to explain that in several ways
 since.

I should be very contemptible to indulge in
 such a thought."

---
They were silent now awhile, and
---
" Do you remember, in Casterbridge?
---
when I carried you into the King's Arms
---
: that was mine."

---
I know
---
"- I know it all
---
" I, for one, shall never cease."

---
that events
 so fell out
---
I, too, am very sorry
---
I mean
---
, you know
---
, I am sorry you thought

---
" I--"
" I have always this dreary pleasure in thinking over
 those past times with you--.
---
that I was something
---
that you belonged
 ALMOST to me
---
But, of course, that's nothing.
---
You
 never liked me."

---
" I did; and, too."Do you now?"

---
" How do you mean which?"

---
" Do you like me, or
---
do you respect me?"

---
I do n't know--
---
" at least, I can not tell you.
---
It is
 difficult.
---
My
 treatment of you was thoughtless, inexcusable, wicked!

---
I shall eternally regret it.
---
If there had been anything
 I could have done to make amends I would most
 gladly have done it
---
-- there was nothing on earth I so
 longed to do as to repair the error.
---
But that was not
 possible."

---
you were not so far in the
 wrong.
---
as you suppose
---
you had
 real complete proof that you are what, in fact, you are
 -- a widow--
---
would you repair the old wrong to me by
 marrying me
---
" I can not say.
---
" Well, then, do you know that without further proof
 of any kind you may marry again in about six years
 from the present-- subject to nobody's objection or
 blame?"

---
" I know all that.
---
But
 do n't talk of it-- seven or six years-- where may we all
 be by that time?"

---
" They will soon glide by, and
---
it will seem an
 astonishingly short time."

---
when they
 are past
---
" Yes, yes; I have found that in my own experience."

---
If I
 wait that time
---
", will you marry me?
---
You own
---
that you
 owe me amends
---
that be your way of making them
---
I mean
---
, that I do n't like.
---
Perhaps it is not proper, and
.
---
I ought
---
us drop it
---
as I said
---
" Of course, I'll drop the subject.
---
if you wish
---
But
 propriety has nothing to do with reasons.
---
On your side, at least, there
 is no passion or blamable haste
---
-- on mine, perhaps,
 there is.
---
But I ca n't help.
---
if you choose
 from a feeling of pity, and
---
as you say
---
which will set all things right
 and
---
that,, a wish to make
 amends, to make a bargain with me for a far- ahead
 time-- an agreement make me happy, late though it may be--
---
you been

---
Surely you can say to
 me as much?
---
as this, you will have me back again

---
should circumstances permit
---
it is only a little promise-- that
 if you marry again, you will marry me!
---
It was
 a simple physical fear-- the weak of the strong
---
whilst you wish
---
-- you
 have taken me so by surprise--"
"
---
we'll not mention
---
Now, this time I know."

---
you will keep
 your word
---
" That's."

---
why I hesitate
---
" O what
 shall I do
---
I do n't love you, and
---
I much fear.
---
If you, sir, know
---
that, and I can yet give
 you happiness by a mere promise to marry at the end of
 six years,
---
, it is a
 great honour to me.
---
has little love left,
---
it
 will
---
if I can not promise soon
---
" O no, it is not!
---
I mean soon.
---
Christmas, we'll
 say."
" Christmas!"
---
Well, I'll say no more to you about it till that
 time
---
which showed
---
how entirely the soul is the slave of the
 body, the ethereal spirit dependent for its quality upon
 the tangible flesh and blood
---
When the
 weeks intervening between the night of this conversa-
 tion and Christmas day began perceptibly
---
They were auditing accounts, and,"
---
why I think
---
the true
 reason to do so for good or for evil, is this
 -- it is a thing I have not breathed to a living soul as
 yet."

---
- i believe
---
if I do n't give my word
---
" Really, do ye?
---
" I believe this."
---
Heaven knows
---
I say it in a spirit
---
for I am grieved and
---
the very
 reverse of vain, troubled to my
 soul about it- i believe.
---
O Gabriel, I tremble at my responsibility, for
 it!"

---
" Well, I think this much, ma'am, as I told you years
 ago."
---
I ca n't suppose
---
- i hope
 that nothing so dreadful hangs on to it as you fancy
---
you know
---
since the case is so sad and oddlike
---
But,
 why do n't ye give the conditional promise?
---
I think."

---
I
 would
---
But is it right?
---
Some rash acts of my past life
 have taught me
---
I do want and!
---
And
 six years-- why we may all be in our graves by that
 BATHSHEBA TALKS
---
Such thoughts give a sort
 of absurdity to the scheme.
---
Now, is n't it preposterous,
 Gabriel?
---
, I can not think.

---
But is it wrong?
---
You know
---
-- you are older than I."
"
---
" Yes, eight years-- and is it wrong?"

---
":  I do n't see anything really
 wrong about it."
---
that makes it doubtful
---
if you ought
---
for I may suppose-- --
---
"
" Yes, you may suppose
---
that love is wanting
---
If wild heat had
---
The real sin, ma'am
 in my mind, lies in thinking of ever wedding wi."

---
' a man
 you do n't love honest and true
---
That I'm willing to pay the penalty of.
---
"" said Bath-
 sheba, firmly.
---
You know
---
", Gabriel, this is.
---
what I can-
 not get off my conscience
---
Well, there's the debt, which can
 only be discharged in one way, and
---
I believe.
---
I am

---
if it honestly lies in my power,
---
that it is
 an inconvenient debt
---
I've been a rake, and
---
I ask you
---
the single point is,--?
---
am I free to entertain such an idea,
---
even
 though' tis a sort of penance-- for it will be that
---
I
 hate the act of marriage under such circumstances, and

---
" It seems to me."

---
" I shall get to."

---
, I suppose,
---
because I can not help

---
" Well, then, in religious sense you will be as free
 to THINK o' marrying again as any real widow of one
 year's standing.
---
When I want a broad- minded opinion for
 general enlightenment, distinct from special advice
---
So I like the parson's opinion on law, the
 lawyer's on doctoring, the doctor's on business, and my
 business- man's-- that is, yours-- on morals."
"
---
I'm afraid there's a hitch in that argument."
---
I could wait for you as well as he
---
That was the insect sting.
---
But to give such cool advice
 -- the very advice-- it ruffled our
 heroine all the afternoon.





---
I
 CHRISTMAS- EVE came, and
---
a party to give in the evening was the great subject of talk
 in Weatherbury.
---
It was not.
---
that the rarity of Christmas
 parties in the parish made this one a wonder, but
---
The announcement
 had had an abnormal and incongruous sound,.
---
as if one
 should hear of croquet- playing in a cathedral aisle, or

---
that some much- respected judge was going upon the
 stage
---
That the party was intended
---
to be a truly jovial
 one there was no room for doubt.
---
A large bough of
 mistletoe had been brought from the woods that day, and
.
---
Holly
 and ivy had followed in armfuls.
---
From six that morning
 till past noon the huge wood fire in the kitchen roared
 and
---
sparkled at its highest, the kettle, the saucepan, and
 the threelegged pot appearing in the midst of the flames
 like Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego; moreover,
 roasting and basting operations were
---
As it grew later
---
the fire was made up in the large
 long hall into which the staircase descended, and
---
all
 encumbrances were cleared out for dancing.
---
which was
---
In spite of all this, the spirit of revelry was wanting
 In the atmosphere of the house.
---
Such a thing had
 never been attempted before by its owner, and
---
it was

---
Intended gaieties would
 insist upon appearing like solemn grandeurs, the organ-
 ization of the whole effort, and
---
was carried out coldly, by
 hirelings
---
a shadow seemed,.

---
that the proceedings were unnatural to
 the place and the lone man who lived therein, and hence
 not good
---
" I am foolishly agitated- i can not tell why.

---
I wish; but

---
I had not been obliged
---
there's.
---
when I promised
---
I had no idea there

---
" But I would go now."
---
Yes, I shall make my appearance, of course."
---
" But I am THE CAUSE of the party, and."

---
that
 upsets me!--
---
I am the reason of the party- i.
---
If it had

---
not been for me, there would never have been one.
---
I
 ca n't explain any more.

---
-- there's no more
---
I wish."

---
I had never seen Weatherbury
---
" That's wicked of you--."

---
than
 you are
---
I have never been free from trouble

---
since I have lived here, and
---
this party is likely to bring
 me more.
---
how
 it sits upon me
---
But you will leave off that, surely, ma'am?
---
You
 have been a widowlady fourteen months, and."

---
" Is it necessary?
---
No; I will appear as usual,.
---
if
 I were
---
for to wear any light dress people would say things
 about me, and
---
The party does n't suit me a bit;
 but never mind, stay and help to finish me off."
                     
---
that had just been

---
The
 tailor walked round and
---
bored-
 Times had been
---
when the farmer had exclaimed against
 all such niceties as childish
---
" I shall of course see
 you here to- night.
---
I am deter-
."

---
that neither expense nor trouble shall be spared
---
I'll try sir,.
---
though perhaps it may not
 be very early
---
" I am glad indeed
 to see such a change in' ee from what it used to be."

---
" Yes- i must own it-
---
i am bright to- night:  cheerful
 and more than cheerful- so much so that I am almost
 sad again with the sense that all of it is passing away.

---
when I am excessively hopeful and
 blithe
---
And sometimes,, a trouble is looming in the distance: .
---
so that I
 often get, and

---
Still this may be absurd
---
- i feel
.
---
that it is absurd
---
Perhaps my day is dawning at last."

---
" I hope."

---
it' ill be a long and a fair one
---
Yet perhaps my cheerful
 mess rests on a slender hope.
---
And yet I trust my hope.

---
It is faith,
---
I think this time I reckon with
 my host.
---
-- Oak, my hands are a little shaky, or some-
 thing
---
; I ca n't tie this neckerchief properly.
---
Perhaps
 you will tie it for me.
---
The fact is
---
, I have not been well
 lately."

---
, you know
---
" I am sorry to hear that, sir."

---
" Oh, it's nothing.
---
I want,
 please.
---
it done
---
as well as you can
---
Is there any late knot in fashion, Oak?"

---
I do n't know, sir.
---
the farmer went on feverishly--
"?"

---
" That's a word as full o' holes as a
 sieve with them."

---
You have got quite
 cynical lately
---
-- how is it?
---
We seem
---
than I-- tell me
---
" I am afeard.

---
you honour my understanding too much
---
if it is made
 with an honest meaning
---
" It has not gone far yet, but
---
I think it will soon--

---
yes, I know.
---
it will
---
that's enough for me.
---
How
 can I expect more?
---
it may be a
 religious one, but
---
No, no-- it's no such thing
---
Fifteen months nearly have passed and
---
is there anything so wonderful in an engagement of
 little more than five years?"

---
" It seems long in a forward view.
---
Remember, you have

---
A knock was given at the door,
 and
---
I went there first, too."

---
" That's a nuisance."

---
"' Tis rather, I suppose."

---
" Yet I do n't see that,
---
I sha n't ask any lawyer-- not I."
"
---
But that's not it, exactly.
---
that is ayless a lammocken
 vagabond; and."

---
that's a punishable situation
---
it was with some anxiety
---
what
 I want
---
is this
---
" Now, to know, do you think
---
Upon
 my soul, I should never have believed it!
---
Have you found out?"

---
" I haen't been able to learn.
---
I did n't know a word about any such thing till
 yesterday, and
---
I heard
---
all then was.
---
, they say.
---
And they say
: but?
---
since they were
 at Greenhill Fair
---
what can folk believe o't
---
, I know
---
" I'm not so sure of that....
---
that you never
 saw a finer or more splendid creature in your life
---
Upon my honour, that day
 I wondered.
---
what I could have been made of
---
And then I was

---
which I'm free of
 at last
---
when you passed by
 yesterday
---
I know
---
them go past me to what was yond, much as if
 I'd been no more than a leafless tree
---
Ay, and there were
---
the fellers round and
 saying, Ware o' the pommy, ma'am
---
: ' twill spoil yer
 gown.
---
I'll make some cider- wine
---
" I must go and.
---
O yes, I see

---
that- i must go
---
" I do n't know about that.
---
though
 I've never been able to get into one, the devil's in't
---
you must
 own it: a higher class of animal- a finer tissue.
---
How-
 ever, stick to me, and
---
neither this haughty goddess,
 dashing piece of womanhood, Juno- wife of mine( Juno
 was a goddess,), nor
---
you know
---
anybody else shall hurt
 you.
---
But all this wants
---
looking into, I perceive.

---
What with one thing and another, I see."
                    
---
that my work
 is well cut out for me
---
V
" How do I look to- night, Liddy?"
---
" I never saw.
---
you look so well before
---
Yes- i'll tell
 you."

---
when you looked like it
---
-- that night, a year and a
 half ago, when you came in so wildlike, and
---
Everybody will think
---
that I am setting myself
---
" At least they'll say so.
---
Ca n't my hair be brushed
 down a little flatter?
---
I dread
---
you ca n't well be
,
---
plainer
 than you are
---
unless you go in sackcloth at once
---
Tis
 your excitement is."

---
what makes
---
you look so noticeable
 to- night
---
I do n't know
---
" what's the matter, I feel wretched at
 one time, and buoyant at another.
---
I wish.

---
I could have

---
as I have been for the last year
 or so
---
, what
 would you do, ma'am?
---
" Mind, I wo n't hear.
---
Do
 you hear?"

---
" I beg pardon, ma'am.
---
we women be
---
But knowing what rum
 things, I just said-- however,."

---
I wo n't
 speak of it again
---
" No marrying for me yet for many a year; if ever,
" twill be!
---
you
 think,

VI
" Oak, said
---
before you go
---
what has been passing in my mind lately
---
I mean.
---
That share is small
---
, too small, consider-
 ing how little I attend to business now, and how much
 time and.
---
you give to it
---
since the world
 is brightening for me
---
Well,, I want.
---
I'll
 make a memorandum of the arrangement which struck
 me as likely to be convenient, for I haven't time to talk
 about it now; and
---
then we'll discuss it at our leisure.

---
My intention is ultimately, and
---
until you can take all the expendi-
 ture upon your shoulders
---
, I'll be a sleeping partner in
 the stock.
---
I hope
---
Then,- i feel."
---
I
 shall, why-- --"
" Pray do n't speak of it, sir
---
" We
 do n't know.
---
what may happen
---
So many upsets may
 befall' ee.
---
There's many a slip,--
---
as they say
---
and I
 would advise you-
---
i know."

---
you'll pardon me this once--

---
I know
---
", I know.
---
I have

in-
 creasing your share
---
But the feeling about is on account of what I know of you
 Oak
---
, I have learnt a little about your secret:.
---
what must have been a
 great pain to you
---
O that's not necessary.
---
I must get used to such as that
---
to be succeeded by a deep solemnity
---
the twilight deepening to darkness
---
which were
 those of a mind following out the presumed thread of
 that jewel's future history
---
The noise of wheels at the front of the house became
 audible.
---
" They be coming, sir--!"

---
lots of'em-- a- foot and a-
 driving
---
" I was coming down this moment.
---
I
 heard
---
" How does this cover me?
---
Nobody would recognize me now
---
, I'm sure
---
" You've made up your mind
---
Yes; of course I have."

---
that you have got into, sergeant
---
You see all these things
, and
---
if you go back
---
they wo n't sound
 well at all.
---
if I was you
---
as you be
 
---
Now that's my outspoke mind, and
---
I've been called a
 long- headed feller here and there."

---
here am I living from hand to
 mouth-- a needy adventurer.
---
Besides, it is no use
 talking now
---
; it is too late, and
---
I am glad of it
---
; I've been
 seen and.
---
if it had n't
 been for you and rubbish about
 getting a separation
---
I do n't put it off any longer.

---
What the deuce put it into my head
---
to run away at all,
 I ca n't think!
---
Humbugging sentiment-- that's.
---
what it
 was
---
" I should have known it.
---
who you are talking to
---
I say'
---
is this
---
if I were you
---
, that I'd
 go abroad again--
---
where I came from
---
I would n't stir up the business and.
---
that about
 your play- acting is sure to come out
---
, you know
---
although
 you think otherwise
---
My eyes and limbs, there'll be a
 racket!"

---
if you go back just now-- in the middle of Bold-
 wood's Christmasing
---
I expect."
---
I shall not be a very welcome
 guest
---
said the sergeant, with a slight
 laugh." A sort of Alonzo the Brave; and when I go in
 the guests will sit in silence and fear, and all laughter
 and pleasure will be hushed, and the lights in the
 chamber burn blue, and the worms-- Ugh, horrible!--
 Ring for some more brandy, Pennyways, I felt an
 awful shudder just then!
---
Well, what is there besides?

---
A stick- i must have a walking- stick."

---
it would be necessary
---
I
 sometimes think, and.
---
But there's
.
---
Well,
 you'll do, of course, sergeant,
 and
---
as you like about going
---
as for me, I'll do."

as you tell me

what the time is

I shall not hurry along the road, and

---
which occasionally opened and,
 but the glowworm shine of the
 pale lamp amid the evergreens over the door
---
when a golden rod of light would
 stripe the ground for the moment and
---
" one of them remarked in a whisper."
---
for one believe it
---
you know
---
said the next.
---
You may
 depend upon't.
---
said the first.
---
that one is more minded
---
" No, no. I do n't hold with' ee there.
---
who's that?
---
This was to some footsteps that were
 heard approaching.
" William Smallbury.
---
"" said a dim figure in the shades,
.
---
" Dark as a hedge, to-
 night, is n't it?
---
I all but missed the plank over the river
 ath'art there in the bottom--
---
We met here a few minutes ago."

---
Oh, I hear now
---
"-- that's Sam Samway
---
I
 knowed the voice, too
---
But I say, William.
---
" Samway whispered
---
?" said Smallbury,.

---
"
" Yes, I have.
---
Laban Tall named a hint of it to me
 but now-- but
---
I do n't think it.
---
" A footstep drew near.
" Laban?"

---
" Yes,' tis I." said Tall.

---
" Have ye heard any more about that?"

---
" No." said Tall,.
---
" And I'm.
---
we'd better keep quiet
---
God send
---
that it mid be a lie, for

---
, that's true; and

---
that can be said of very few
---
They stood silent then
---
during which interval sounds of merri-
 ment
---
Then the front door again
 opened
---
, the rays streamed out,
---
, the
 door closed, and
---
We'd better stand quiet
---
they being under the bushes on the grass
---
They heard.

---
" I hope to God!
---
this night will be
 nothing but misery to me
---
O my darling, my darling,
 why do you keep me in suspense like this?"

---
they all distinctly heard
 it.
---
the noise
 from indoors was again just audible,.
---
until, a few minutes
 later, light wheels could be distinguished coming down
 the hill
---
They drew nearer, and.

---
the door closed
 again
---
Gracious heaven, I did n't know!"
---
" I thought.

---
You do n't know much of master,."
---
if you thought
 that
---
" said Samway.

---
we heard
---
" I wish."
---
we had told of the report at once
---
the first
 uneasily continued.
---
" More harm may come of this than
.
---
we know of
---
Poor Mr. Boldwood, it will, be hard upon
 en.
---
I wish
---
Well, God forgive me
 for such a wish!
---
Nothing has prospered in Weatherbury.
---
And now I've no heart.
---
's
 look into Warren's for a few minutes first
---
, shall us,
 neighbours?"

---
Samway, Tall, and Smallbury agreed and.
---
The three soon drew near the malt- house,
.
---
The pane of glass was illuminated
 as usual.
---
Smallbury was a little in advance of the rest
!
---
The light from the pane was now perceived but upon some
 object close to the glass.
---
It was a human face.

---
's come closer
---
they
 approached on tiptoe
---
There was.
---
to have been arrested by a conversation
 which was in progress in the malt- house
---
is n't it-- hey?
---
" tis only
 keeping up o' Christmas?"
" I can not say."
---
I can not understand
 and."

---
as they had come
---
When they were quite
 out of earshot all by one instinct
---
" said Tall,
 breathing.

---
" And so it did me.
---
" said Samway.
---
" What's?"

---
" I do n't see that' tis any business of ours."
---
Smallbury
 murmured dubiously.

---
" But it is!'
---
which is everybody's business
---
Tis a thing,
 said Samway.
---
" We know very well
---
that master's on a
 wrong tack, and
---
we
 should let.
---
'em know at once
---
-- you'd better go and."

---
I bain't fit for any such thing."
---
" said Laban, nervously.

---
" I should think.
---
I shall have nothing to do with it.
---
"" said Smallbury.

---
" We do n't know.
---
if I must
---
I must
---
" Very well,, I suppose.
---
" Tall reluct-
 antly answered.
---
What must I say?
---
""
" Just ask."

---
If I tell
 anybody
---
,' twill be mistress."

---

---
Laban then went to the door.
---
the assemblage being immediately inside the
 hall
---
One of them
 began, and.

---
that
 walking was thing not worth doing now
---
I should think."
---
Laban must have seen mistress by
 this time
---
" said Smallbury,."
---
The door opened.
---
Tall appeared, and?
---
" said both.

---
" I did n't like."
---
Laban faltered
 out.
---
" They were all in such a stir,.
---
Somehow the fun seems,
---
though everything's there
---
that a heart can desire,
 and
---
I could n't for my soul interfere and
---
if' twas to save my life, I could n't!"

---
" I suppose."
---
we had
---
better all go in together
---
said
 Samway, gloomily.
---
" Perhaps I may have a chance of
 saying a word to master."

---
which, like the hall, was decorated with holly
 and ivy, and
---
Nobody was in the room, but.
"
---
when the master of the house
 entered
---
Mrs. Troy-- you are not going?
---
" We've
 hardly begun!"

---
If you'll excuse me
---
", I should like."
---
as it is
 not late."
---
I can walk home, and
---
when they choose
---
I've been trying.
---
" You know perhaps what I
 long to say?"

---
You do give it
---
" Now, that's evasion!
---
I do n't
 want.
---
it become
 known to anybody
---
, you know
---
who are beyond the influence of passion
---
how false this picture was
---
You owe it to me!"

---
I feel."
---
that I do
---
that is,
---
if you
 demand it
---
However, it had not much effect now, for in a passionless murmur:" I have no feeling in the matter at all.

---
And I do n't at all know, and
---
what is right to do in my
 diddicult position
---
I have nobody to advise me.
---
But
 I give my promise, if I must.
---
I give it as the rendering of
 a debt, conditionally, of course, on my being a widow."

---
" You'll marry me between five and six years hence?"

---
I'll marry nobody
 else."

---
" But surely you will name the time, or
---
there's nothing
 in the promise at all?"

---
O, I do n't know!"
---
me go
---
" I am afraid what to do!
.

---
that seems
---
perhaps it is breaking the commandments
---
then it
 is dreadful
---
me ask a solicitor, Mr. Boldwood,
---
if I
 ought or no
---
Say the words, dear one, and the subject shall be
 dismissed
---
" Promise yourself to me; I
 deserve it,!
---
indeed I do,
---
for I have loved you more than
 anybody in the world
---
if I said hasty words and

---
And showed uncalled- for heat of manner towards you, believe
 me, dear, I did not mean to distress you
---
I did not know.

---
what I said
---
You would n't let!
---
a dog suffer
---
what I have suffered
---
,
 could you but
---
Sometimes I shrink from your
 knowing what I have felt for you, and sometimes I am
 distressed that all of it you never will know.
---
when I would give
 up my life for you
---
as they quivered against
 the light
---
And you'll not-- press me-- about
 anything more--?"
---
if I say in five or six years
---
" Yes, then I'll leave it to time."

---
, I'll marry you
 in six years from this day,."
---
if we both live
---
" And you'll take this as a token from me."

---
" What is it?
---
Oh I can not wear a ring!"
---
;" besides, I would n't
 have a soul!
---
that it's an engagement
---
Perhaps it
 is improper?
---
Besides, we are not engaged in the usual
 sense
---
, are we?
---
" It means simply a pledge-- no sentiment-- the seal
 of a practical compact."
---
" I can not wear it."
---
" You frighten me, almost.
---
me go home
---
" Only to- night:  wear it just to- night, to please me!"

---
if you wish it so
 earnestly
---
Now loosen my hand; I will, indeed I will
 wear it to- night."

---
" And it shall be the beginning of a pleasant secret
 courtship of six years, with a wedding at the end?"

---
It must be!
---
, I suppose,
---
since you will have it so
---
I am happy now.
---
" God bless
 you!"

---
To get to the door it was necessary, and
---
There was no music or dancing in progress just now.

---
, which had been arranged for the work-
 folk specially, a group conversed in whispers, and with
 clouded looks.
---
" What is it
---
One of them turned and
---
" It was
 something Laban heard of
---
replied uneasily:, that's all, sir."

---
Anybody married or?
---
One would think from your looks and mysterious ways
."

---
that it was something very dreadful indeed
---
" O no, sir, nobody is dead."
---
said Tall.

---
I wish."
---
somebody was
---
said Samway, in a whisper.

---
" What do you say, Samway?"
---
If you have anything to say
---
said Samway to
 Tall.
---
If you want."

---
you had
---
Do you know?
---
what they mean
---
There was a smart rapping at the door.
---
" Though I did n't
 tell them.
---
"
" It is a stranger, ma'am."
---
The message was given, and
---
There was an unearthly silence,.
---
all looking towards
 the newcomer
---
who had just learnt
---
whether it
 were not all a terrible illusion
---
Bathsheba, I come here for
 you!"

---
do you hear?
---
what I say
---
A strange voice came from the fireplace-- a voice
 sounding far off and confined, as if from a dungeon.

---
Hardly a soul in the assembly recognized the thin tones
.
---
Sudden dispaire had trans-

---
The truth was
.
---
no obscuration was apparent
 from without.

---
The scream had been heard but
---
a few seconds When
 it was followed by sudden deafening report that
 echoed through the room and stupefied them all.
---
The
 oak partition shook with the concussion, and
---
the place
 was filled with grey smoke.

---
The veins had swollen, and.
---
It was double- barrelled,
 and.
---
the gun exploded a second time,.

---
which
 crossed the ceiling
---
Well, it makes no difference!"
---
" There is another way for me to die."

CHAPTER LIV



 AFTER THE SHOCK


 BOLDWOOD passed into the high road and.
---
o'clock crossed the Moor into the town.

---
The streets were nearly deserted now, and
---
the waving
 lamp- flames only lighted up rows of grey shop- shutters,
 and
---
which was closed
 by an iron studded pair of doors
---
This was the entrance
 to the gaol, and
---
over it a lamp was fixed,.

---
the light en-
 abling the wretched traveller
---
The small wicket at last opened, and
---
a porter
 appeared.
---
Long before this time Weatherbury had been
, and the wild deed which had ter-
 minated
---
All the female guests were
 and
---
though scarcely a single drop of blood had
 flowed
---
The temporary coma had ceased, and
---
activity
 had come with the necessity for it.
---
which seem ordinary in philosophy
---
Deeds of endur-
 ance,, are rare in
 conduct, and
---
,
 turning up a face of which only the wellknown lines
 remained,."
---
it was hers
---
all else in the picture
 having faded quite
---
It is,.
---
I believe, useless, but
---
had there been a quarrel?

---
this
 fatal event had been superimposed.
---
However, it was too
 late now, and

---
The miles necessary to be traversed, and other
 hindrances incidental to the lateness of the hour and
 the darkness of the night, delayed the arrival of Mr,

---
Who has
---
A was quite dead, sir."

---
This was astonishing information."
---
said the doctor.
---
" There will have
, and
---
till the law was known
---
What has been

---
I do n't know, sir."
---
me fill the bath
---
after that told me
---
I
 had better
---
because I looked so ill
---
a nurse come in,
---
But I thought.
---
I'd wait in the next room in case
---
I heard, but
---
that was for more candles,
---
because hers had burnt
 down into the socket
---
we were
---
when you or Mr. Thirdly came, sir
---
they all went upstairs together,.
---
preceded by Liddy
 Smallbury
---
Everything was silent as the grave.
---
when
 they paused on the landing
---
rustling across the room:
 the key turned in the lock, and
---
" Oh, Mr. Aldritch, you have come at last.
---
they saw by the light of the candles which were on the
 drawers a tall straight shape lying at the further end
 of the bedroom, wrapped in white
---
Everything around
 was quite orderly.
---
The doctor went in, and.

---
after a
 few minutes returned to the landing again,
---
It is all done, indeed,
---
" remarked Mr.
 Aldritch, in a subdued voice.
---
The body has been
 undressed and.

---
that superhuman strain was

---
The simple consciousness no longer required had
---
The sufferer was got to bed, and
---
O it is my fault
 --
---
how can I live!
---
O Heaven, how can I live!"

THE MARCH FOLLOWING--" BATHSHEBA BOLDWOOD"


 WE pass rapidly on into the month of March, to a
 breezy day without sunshine, frost, or dew.
---
Yai*-
 bury Hill, about midway between Weatherbury and
 Casterbridge, where the turnpike road passes over
 the crest, a numerous concourse of people
---
the eyes of the greater number being fre-
 quently stretched afar in a northerly direction.
---
one of which contained the high
 sheriff
---
With the idlers, many of whom had mounted
 to the top of a cutting formed for the road
---
At the end of half- an- hour a faint dust was seen in
 the expected quarter, and
---
The
 judge changed carriages.

---
whilst a flourish was blown
 by the big- cheeked trumpeters, and
---
a procession being
 formed of the vehicles and javelin- men, they all pro-
 ceeded towards the town,
---
as they had seen
---
who as soon the judge move
 off
---
I seed
---
you squeezing close to the carriage
---
" Did ye notice my lord
 judge's face?"

---
" I did.
---
" I looked hard at en,; and
---
that was towards
 me
---
" Well, I hope for the best."
---
though
 bad that must be
---
However, I sha n't go to the trial,
 and
---
I'd advise the rest of ye that bain't wanted to bide
 away.'
---
I said this morning
---
" The very thing." observed
---
Joseph,
" Justice is come
---
a bystander said"
---
who can talk like that
---
But I do n't like
---
And now, neighbours, as I said,
."

---
The resolution was adhered to; and
---
Their suspense
 was diverted, however, by a discovery which was made
 in the afternoon,.

---
which had

---
nobody imagined.

---
There were two muffs,
 sable and ermine.
---
Above all there was a case of
 jewellery,.
---
These things had been bought in Bath and
 other towns from time to time, and.
---
brought home by
 stealth
---
They were all carefully packed in paper, and
."
---
each package was
---
a
 date being subjoined six years in advance in every
 instance.

---
These somewhat pathetic evidences of a mind crazed
 with care and love.
---
as every
 one supposed
---
Facts
 elicited previous to the trial, but
---
they had not been of sufficient weight
.
---
It was astonishing
---
that a
 presumption of insanity was raised
---
, now, how many collateral
 circumstances were remembered
---
to which a condition
 of mental disease seemed.

---
A petition was addressed to the Home Secretary,
.
---
which appeared
---
It was
 not,.
---
" numerously signed" by the inhabitants of Caster-
 bridge
---
was.

---
that evidence
 was taken
---
which it was hoped
---
The upshot of the petition was waited for in.
---
Weather-
 bury with solicitous interest
---
The execution had been
 fixed for eight o'clock on a Saturday morning about a
 fortnight
---
after the sentence was passed, and
---
up to
 Friday afternoon no answer had been received.
---
rich
 and glowing in the afternoon sun, and some moving
 figures were there
---
They were carpenters lifting a post
 into a vertical position within the parapet.
---
It was dark, and
---
half the
 village was out.

---
And I'm afraid
 there's no hope.
---
" Do ye think?"
---
said Smallbury.

---
" I ca n't honestly say."
---
that I do
---
, that we can talk of another time
---
Has there been
 any change in mistress this afternoon?"

---
if you be come, and

---
if there's news,
---
Shall I go and?"

---
you've come
---
There's a chance yet
---
So Laban-- Laban is here,
---
" Yes." said Tall.

---
What I've arranged
---
" is,.
---
that you shall ride to town
 the last thing to- night;
---
If nothing
 has been received by eleven to- night
---
, they say."

---
there's
 no chance at all
---
" I do so hope."
---
If it is not
---
If you haven't seen poor mistress since Christmas
---
Laban departed and
---
at eleven o'clock
 that night  several of the villagers strolled along the
 road to Casterbridge and.

---
when they all were weary

---
At last, the tramp of a horse was heard in the distance--
 First dead,
---
as if on turf it trode,

---
they all stepped down from the bank on
 which
---
they had been standing into the road, and
---
the
 rider pranced into the midst of them.

---
Is that you, Laban?
---
" Yes--' tis come.
---
As the summer drew on
---
None of the old colour had
---
its absolute paleness was heightened by
---
, Bath-
 sheba heard singing inside the church, and
---
that the singers were practising
---
Underneath this was now inscribed in new letters:--

---
WHO DIED DECEMBER24TH,18
---
THE REMAINS OF THE AFORESAID
 FRANCIS TROY,
--,
 Whilst read and meditated the tones of
 the organ began again in the church, and
---
The door was, and
---
the choir was learning a new
 hymn.
---
the imminent tears to flow
---
if they wished
---
as those children were, un-
 concerned at the meaning of their words, because too
 innocent to feel the necessity for any such expression
---
which had been without emotion
 during enactment
---
those scenes had emotion then.
---
how long have you
 been here?"

---
" Are you going in?
---
there came
 from within the church as from a prompter--

---
l loved the garish day, and,
---
spite of fears,
 pride ruled my will:.

---
" I was.
---
I am one of the bass singers
---
",
 you know.
---
I have sung bass for several months.
"
---
Indeed: I was n't aware of that.
---
I'll leave you, then."
, and.

---
which I have loved long since
---
me drive you away, mistress
---
I think."

---
I
 wo n't go in to- night
---
" O no-- you do n't drive me away.

---
Then they stood in a state of some embarrassment
.
---
I've not seen you- i mean spoken to you-- since
 ever so long, have I?"
---
Were
 you going into church
---
I came."

---
if they had cut the inscription
---
, you need n't mind,, on the matter which is in both our minds
 at this moment
---
if
 you wish to
---
" And have they done it?
---
as you wished
---
So together they went and."
---
" It seems like yesterday to me."

---
as if it were years ago- long years, and

---
I had been dead between.
---
And now I am going home,
 Mr. Oak."

---
I wanted."
---
as I could
---
I think
---
I may just mention it
 now,
---
if you'll allow me
---
It is.
---
that I may soon have
---
The fact is."

---
, I am think-

---
not yet, you know
---
" Why, Gabriel, what are you
 going?"

---
" Well, I've thought it best."
---
" California is the spot I've had in my mind to try."

---
" I've had the refusal o' it' tis true;
---
but nothing is

---
I have reasons for giving up.
---
I shall
 finish out my year there as manager for the trustees,
 but no more."

---
And what shall I do without you?
---
Oh, Gabriel, I
 do n't think.
---
you ought
---
You've been with
 me so long-- through bright times and dark times-- such
 old friends that as we are--
---
that it seems unkind almost.
---
I
 had fancied.
---
if you leased the other farm as master
---
that,
 you might still give a helping look across at mine
---
" I would have willingly."

---
that I am more helpless than ever you go
 away
---
" Yes, that's the ill fortune o' it."
---
" And it is because of that very help-
 lessness that I feel bound to go.
---
the others become weary and neglectful
 of the old cause, and
---
Three weeks went on, and
---
where the farm accounts were kept, and
---
The autumn wore away gloomily enough amid these
 melancholy conjectures, and
---
that Oak, whose bass voice heard
---
as soon,
 and there was the barest excuse for a divergence
---
nobody
 was visible in the room.
---
if it were right
---
" Who have I
 the honour-- O how stupid of me, not to know you,
 mistress!"

---
" I shall not be your mistress much longer, shall I
 Gabriel?"
---
I suppose--.
---
Oh--
 and I'll get a light.
---
No; not on my account."
" It is so seldom.
---
that I get a lady visitor
---
that I'm
 afraid I haven't proper accommodation
---
Will you sit
 down, please?
---
Here's a chair, and
---
there's one, too.

---
I am sorry that my chairs all have wood seats, and are
 rather hard, but
---
I was thinking of getting some new
 ones."
---
" They are quite easy enough for me."

---
It was very
 odd to these two persons, who knew each other passing
 well, that the mere circumstance of their meeting in a
 new place and in a new way should make them so
 awkward and constrained.
---
" You'll think it strange, but--"
" O no; not at all."

---
that I have come
---
" But I thought--
---
Gabriel, I have been uneasy in the
 belief that I have offended you, and.
---
that you are going
 away on that account
---
It grieved me very much and

---
I could n't help.
---
if you could do that
---
But, what are you
 going away for else?"

---
I am not going
---
" to emigrate, you know
---
; I was n't
 aware that you would wish me not to when I told' ee or I
 should n't ha' thought of doing it."
---
" I
 have arranged for Little Weatherbury Farm and.
---
You know.
---
I've
 had a share in it for some time
---
Still, that would n't
 prevent,
---
my attending to your business as before had n't
 it been."

---
that things have been said about us
---
Things said
 about you and me!
---
What are they?"

---
" I can not tell you."

---
" It would be wiser
---
if you were
---
to, I think.
---
You have

---
I do n't
 see."

---
why you should fear
---
" It is nothing that you have done, this time.
---
What does that mean?"

---
You asked me
---
to
 tell, so you must n't blame me."

---
I did n't know."
---
it
 was
---
that you meant
---
Such a thing
 as that is too absurd
---
" Yes; of course, it is too absurd.
---
I do n't desire any
 such thing
---
; I should think.
---
that was plain enough by
 this time
---
Surely, surely you be the last person in the
 world I think of marrying.
---
It is too absurd,."

---
as you say
" Too
---
-- s- s- soon" were the words I used
---
" I must beg your pardon for correcting you, but you
 said," too absurd," and
---
so do I."
" I beg your pardon too!
---
what I said
---
But it
 does n't matter a bit--,
" too soon"
---
not at ali- but I only meant
---
Indeed, I did n't, Mr. Oak, and you must
 believe me!"

---
the firelight
 being faint
---
there was not much to be seen."
---
if I only knew one thing--
---
whether you would allow
---
me
 to love you and, and
---
win you marry you after ali- if I
 only knew that
---
" But you never will know.
---
Because you never ask.
" Oh-- Oh!
---
" You ought.
---
" It shows!
---
you did n't
 care a bit about me, and
---
It was very cruel of you, consider-
; and
---
I was the first sweetheart that you ever had, and

---
you were the first I ever had
---
I shall not forget it!"

---
You know
---
it was purely
---
that people knew
---
I had a sort
 of feeling for'ee
---
I fancied, from the way.

---
we were

---
that it might injure your good name
---
Nobody knows the heat and fret."

---
I have been caused
 by it
---
" And was that all?"

---
Oh, how glad I am!
---
I came
---
" I have thought so
 much more of you.
---
since I fancied
---
you did not want

---
But I must be going now, or
---
I
 shall be missed.
---
as they went to the door
---
," it seems exactly as if
 I had come courting you-- how dreadful!"

---
it is hard this one visit."

---
They spoke very little of their mutual  feeling; pretty
 phrases and warm expressions being probably un-
 necessary between such tried friends.
---
Theirs was
---
which arises
---
who are thrown together
---
that
 substantial affection( if any arises at all)
 when the two begin first by
 knowing the rougher sides of each other's character,
 and not the best till further on
---
, the romance growing
 up in the interstices of a mass of hard prosaic reality.

---
Where, however, happy circumstance
 permits its development
---
, the compounded feeling proves
.





---
itself to be the only love which is strong as death-- that
 love which many waters can not quench, nor the floods
 drown, beside which the passion usually called by the
 name is evanescent as steam
---
that it is
 possible
---
A licence-- O yes, it must be a licence."
---
They walked together into the village.

---
until
 they came to a little lane behind the church,
---
who had lately been

---
I'm going
 down this way
---
" what's going on
---
You can keep a secret,
 Coggan
---
" You've proved me, and
---
you know."

---
" Yes, I have, and
---
I do know.
---
Well, then, mistress
 and I mean."

---
And yet I've thought of
 such a thing from time to time
---
; true, I have.
---
I wish'
---
But I assure' ee that this
 great hush is not what I wished for at all, or what
 either of us would have wished if it had n't been for
 certain things that would make a gay wedding seem
 hardly the thing.
---
so I be doing
 this
---
" Ay, I see: quite right.

---
, too, I suppose
---
I must say
---
And you be now going down to the clerk."

---
" Yes; you may as well come with me."

---
I am."
---
as they walked along
---
I suppose,
---
" I'll tell' ee."
---
" I'll knock and.
---
you standing in the background
---
you can tell yer tale.
---
what I
 want
---
I'll make up a few words about the
 farm- work, as a blind."

---
This scheme was considered feasible; and
---
" I wanted."

---
I shall do quite as well."

---
" I hardly think.
---
you will
---
"?" said Mrs. Tall.

---
The clothes will floor us as safe as houses!
---
It ca n't be helped
---
The fact is,'.
---
There, that's what' tis,
 and now I've told' ee, Mother Tall, in a way I should n't
 ha' done if I had n't loved' ee so hopeless well."

---
any further;
 and next they called at
---
the vicar's in a manner which
 excited no curiosity at all
---
" I want
---
you to call me at seven o'clock to- morrow,
---
In
 case I should n't wake."

---
" But you always do wake afore then, ma'am."

---
" Yes, but I have something important to do, which
 I'll tell you of when the time comes, and
---
it's best."

---
" But I thought?"
---
it was I
---
who had
---
" And it is n't six yet."

---
Indeed it is
---
; how can you tell such a story, Liddy?

---
I know.
---
it must be ever so much past seven
---
as you can
---
Come to
 my room as soon; I want."

---
you to give my
 hair a good brushing
---
Whatever IS going on,
 ma'am?
---
" Well, I'll tell you."
---
" But is it safe, ma'am, after what's been said?"
---
It makes"
