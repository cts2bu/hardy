the
 woman enjoyed no society whatever from his presence.
---
Virtually she
 walked the highway alone,.
---
she bore
---
for she kept as close to
 his side
---
she seemed to
, nor he of offering it; and far from
 exhibiting surprise at his ignoring silence she appeared to receive it
 as a natural thing.
---
,
 it was an occasional whisper of the woman to the child-- a tiny girl in
 short clothes and blue boots of knitted yarn-- and the murmured babble of
 the child in reply.


---
The chief-- almost the only-- attraction of the young woman's face was its
 mobility.
---
When she looked down sideways to the girl
---
she became pretty,
 and even handsome, particularly that in the action her features
 caught slantwise the rays of the strongly coloured sun, which made
 transparencies of her eyelids and nostrils and set fire on her lips.

---
When she plodded on in the shade of the hedge
---
she had the hard, half- apathetic expression of one who deems anything
 possible at the hands of Time and Chance except, perhaps, fair play
---
The wife mostly kept her eyes fixed ahead, though with little
 interest-- the scene for that matter being one that might have been
 matched at almost any spot in any county in England at this time of
 the year; a road neither straight nor crooked, neither level nor hilly,
 bordered by hedges, trees, and other vegetation, which had entered the
 blackened- green stage of colour that the doomed leaves pass through on
 their way to dingy, and yellow, and red.
---
" No-- no-- the other one," said the woman.
---
as it threw an air of respectability over her as far as
 it extended
---
which, was made so wide as to reach nearly round her waist
---
She
 slowly stirred the contents of the pot.
---
The dull scrape of her large
 spoon was audible throughout the tent
---
as she thus kept from burning the
 mixture of corn in the grain, flour, milk, raisins, currants, and what
 not
---
, that composed the antiquated slop in which she dealt.
---
as the woman had said
---
she played
---
when she took a bottle
 from under the table
---
His wife had

---
she agreed to a milder allowance after some
 misgiving.


---
his wife but too sadly perceived.


---
she had

---
the wife more than once said
 to her husband," Michael, how about our lodging?
---
she slept.


---
I did for myself that way thoroughly
---
The young woman his wife,, acted
.
---
as if she did not hear them, and
---
who was just
 big enough to be placed for a moment on the bench beside her
---
when she
 wished
---
that she's a little holler in the back and
---
if anybody would buy her
---
she's got it
---
She turned to her husband and.
---
The woman is no good to me.
---
Here-- I am waiting.
 Who'll have her?"


---
The woman whispered
---
;
 she was imploring and anxious:" Come, come, it is getting dark, and
 this nonsense wo n't do.
---
She waited and
---
The woman's manner changed, and
---
her face assumed the grim shape and
.


---
," she said;
---
" Will anybody buy her?
---
"," said she firmly.
---
" Her present owner is not at
 all to her liking!"

" Nor you to mine
---
She shall take the girl if she wants
 to, and.
---
who sat near the woman
---
The woman, however, did stand up."
---
The woman looked on the ground,.


---
as if she maintained her position by a
 supreme effort of will
---
If they do n't take her for that
---
why she's
---
But she sha n't go for less.
---
she's yours.

---
She bowed her head with absolute indifference.


---
she'll be withdrawn.
---
" Now," said the woman,
---
so that her low dry voice
 sounded quite loud,"
---
, I and this girl go with the man.
---
I take the money
---
that the young woman is willing
---
" I would n't hurt her feelings for the world."

" Faith, nor I," said her husband."
---
But she is willing,
---
provided she can
 have the child.
---
She said so only the other day when I talked o't!"


---
said the sailor to her.


---
" I do," said she, after glancing at her husband's face and seeing no
 repentance there.


---
" Very well, she shall have the child, and
---
The sailor looked at the woman and."
---
She paused for an instant,
 with a close glance at him.
---
Then dropping her eyes again, and saying
 nothing, she took up the child and.
---
On reaching it, she turned, and.


---
," she said,"
---
Now I'm no more to' ee
---
; I'll try my luck elsewhere.

---
Seizing the sailor's arm with her right hand, and mounting the little
 girl on her left, she went out of the tent.


---
" Is she gone?
---
she's gone clane enough
---
," said the furmity woman,."
---
I'm not a penny the better for him."


---
I glory in the
 woman's sperrit. I'd ha' done it myself-- if I would n't I'd go, and' a might call, and; but
---
I'd never come back-- no, not till the great
 trumpet, would I!"

" Well, the woman will be better off
---
she's

---
" Mark me-- I'll not go after her!" said the trusser,."
---
her go
---
If she's up to such vagaries she must suffer
 for'em.
---
She'd no business to take the maid--'tis my maid; and
---
the doing again she should n't have her!"


---
She shook
 him, but.
---
not to be struck that
 night, the fair continuing for two or three days, she decided.
---
Extinguishing the last candle, and lowering the flap of the
 tent, she left it, and.




2.



---
" She's gone-- little Elizabeth- Jane.
---
she is
---
who bought her
---
that his
 wife had taken him so literally
---
that she must have been somewhat excited to do this
---
; moreover, she
 must have believed.
---
There may, too, have been enough recklessness and resentment
 beneath her ordinary placidity.

---
" Did I tell my name to anybody last night, or did n't I tell my name?"
  On a previous occasion, she had replied...."
---
that she would not
 hear
---
Yet she knows!
---
I am not in my senses
---
when I do
 that
---
Well, I must walk about....
---
till I find her
---
, why did n't she know better than bring me into this disgrace!"
---
" She was n't queer.'
---
if I was
---
that the
 occupant had just lit her fire
---
that did not
 involve an explanation of the circumstances under which he had lost her
---
; now her face had lost much of
 its rotundity
---
; her skin had undergone a textural change; and
---
though her
 hair had not lost colour
---
She was dressed in the mourning clothes of a widow.
---
Her companion,
 also in black, appeared as a well- formed young woman about eighteen,
.


---
While life's middle summer had set its hardening
 mark on the mother's face
---
, her former spring- like specialities were
 transferred so dexterously by Time to the second figure, her child,
.


---
that the absence of certain facts within her mother's knowledge from the
 girl's mind would have seemed for the moment, to one reflecting on those
 facts,
---
The daughter carried in her outer hand
 a withy basket of old- fashioned make; the mother a blue bundle, which
 contrasted oddly with her black stuff gown.


---
The mother and daughter threaded the crowd for some little
 distance, and.


---
to
 get onward" said the maiden.


---
But I had a fancy
 for looking up here."


---
I first met with Newson-- on such a day as this
---
As she spoke
---
the girl drew a card from
 her pocket and.
---
that I
 last saw the relation we are going to look for
---
I have never clearly had."


---
was----," said her
 mother deliberately.


---
replied the
 young woman,."
---
I suppose?
---
" I suppose?"
---
the girl innocently continued.


---
" She moved on to another part of
 the field.


---
", I should think,."
---
as she gazed round about
---
as she now called herself,

---
Over
 the pot stooped an old woman haggard,.
---
She
 stirred the contents of the pot with a large spoon, and
---
which she served in a couple of chipped yellow
 basins of commonest clay
---
" She was here at that time
---
" Do n't speak to her-- it is n't respectable!"
---
The girl was not loth, and.
---
while her mother went forward
---
The old woman begged for the latter's
 custom as soon as she saw her, and.
---
than she had shown in
 selling six- pennyworths in her younger days
---
Her customer smiled bitterly at this survival of the old trick, and

---
the old woman was far from translating
---
She pretended, and
---
as she did so said blandly to the hag
---
responded the old woman,.
---
" I've stood in this fair- ground, maid,
 wife, and widow, these nine- and- thirty years, and
---
that I was once the owner of a great
 pavilion- tent that was the attraction of the fair
---
I knew the clergy's taste, the dandy gent's taste
---
; I knew the town's
 taste, the country's taste.
---
I even knowed the taste of the coarse
 shameless females.
---
her daughter was still bending over the
 distant stalls."
---
," she said cautiously to the old
 woman," the sale of a wife by her husband in your tent eighteen years
 ago to- day?"


---
half shook her head."
---
I should have minded it in a moment
---
," she said.
---
" I can mind every
 serious fight o' married parties, every murder, every manslaughter, even
 every pocket- picking-- leastwise large ones--.
---
I think so."


---
The furmity woman half shook her head again."
---
," she said,"
---
And yet I do.

---
At any rate, I can mind a man doing something o' the sort-- a man in a
 cord jacket, with a basket of tools; but
---
why I can mind the
 man
---
if a woman ever asked for him
---
that I was
---
had she not discreetly borne in mind
---
that
 unscrupulous person's liquor her husband had been degraded
---
She briefly
 thanked her informant, and
---
who greeted her with,
"
---
I see none but" I have learned what I wanted, however," said her mother quietly.

---
Henchard's wife acted for the best, but
---
she had involved herself in
 difficulties.
---
A hundred times she had been upon the point of telling her
 daughter
---
Elizabeth- Jane the true story of her life, the tragical crisis
 of which had been the transaction at Weydon Fair, when she was not much
 older than the girl now beside her.
---
But she had refrained.
---
An innocent
 maiden had thus grown up in the belief that the relations between the
 genial sailor and her mother were the ordinary ones that they had always
 appeared to be.
---
which had grown with her growth
---
her to live on in the conviction that Newson
 had acquired a morally real and justifiable right to her by his
 purchase-- though the exact bearings and legal limits of that right were
 vague
---
But she was by no means the first or last peasant
 woman who had religiously adhered to her purchaser, as too many rural
 records show.


---
Absolutely helpless she had been taken off
 to Canada where they had lived several years without any great worldly
 success,.
---
though she worked as hard as any woman could
---
that Susan had an awakening
---
to whom she confided her history

---
A friend ridiculed her grave acceptance of her position; and
---
all was over with
 her peace of mind.
---
She saw him no more.


---
when the girl was about eighteen
---
Her mother was in a back corner of the same room engaged
 in the same labour, and
---
she was filling

---
she surveyed her daughter thoughtfully.
---
The sun shone in at the door
 upon the young woman's head and hair, which was worn loose,.
---
Her face, though
 somewhat wan and incomplete, possessed the raw materials of beauty in a
 promising degree.
---
She was handsome in the bone, hardly as yet handsome in the
 flesh.
---
She possibly might never be fully handsome,.


---
unless the carking
 accidents of her daily existence could be evaded before the mobile parts
 of her countenance
---
The sight of the girl made her mother sad-- not vaguely but by logical
 inference.
---
which she had tried so many times
---
The woman had long perceived; and
---
yet now, in
 her eighteenth year, it still remained but little unfolded.
---
How could she become a woman of wider
 knowledge, higher repute--"better,"
---
as she termed it
---
-- this was her
 constant inquiry of her mother.
---
She sought further into things, and
---
than
 other girls in her position ever did
---
her mother groaned.


---
as she felt

---
she could not aid in the search
---
till
 her views had been disturbed by enlightenment
---
She
 asked herself.
---
whether the present moment, now that she was a free woman
 again
---
as she would find in a world where
 everything had been so inopportune, for making a desperate effort to
 advance Elizabeth
---
which her mother could not endure to

---
Elizabeth, a proceeding contemplate
---
She finally resolved.
---
This will account for their conversation at the fair and the
 half- informed state at which Elizabeth was led onward.


---
Elizabeth- Jane discovered to her
 alarm.


---
that her mother's health was not, and but
---
for the girl, she would not be very sorry to quit a life she was
 growing thoroughly weary of
---
while
 her silent mother mused on other things than topography
---
" Why, surely," said Elizabeth,,
---
" I thought so too
---
The features of the
 town had a keen interest for Elizabeth's mother, now that the human side
 came to the fore.
---
Though the two women did not know it
---
In an open space before the church walked a woman with her gown- sleeves
 and
---
that the edge of her underlinen was visible
---
her
 skirt tucked up through her pocket hole.
---
She carried a load under her
 arm from which she was pulling pieces of bread, and handing them to some
 other women who walked with her, which pieces they nibbled critically.

---
they inquired of the woman for the nearest baker's.


---
," she said,
---
"," said Elizabeth's mother shyly.


---
till she knew more of her future
 in this place
---
Not wishing to be observed further, she withdrew with her daughter from the speaker's side.

---
who, since her entry
 into Casterbridge, had seemed strangely weak and agitated," And
---
, I
 think,
---
as I think
---
I'm too worn out to do
 anything--."


---
She sat down upon the lowest step, and
---
Elizabeth- Jane obeyed her
 directions and.


---
She ascended to the top of the steps.


---
though her head was bowed
---
that strangely riveted her attention
---
Her mother,, had already caught from the
 inn- window tones, before the old
 man's words," Mr. Henchard, the Mayor," reached her ears.
---
She arose,
 and.


---
as she could do so without
 showing exceptional eagerness
---
The interior of the hotel dining- room was spread out before her, with
 its tables, and glass, and plate, and inmates.
---
Elizabeth, encumbered with no
 recollections.
---
as her mother was, regarded him with nothing more than
 the keen curiosity and interest which the discovery of such unexpected
 social standing in the long- sought relative naturally begot
---
When last she had seen him.
---
Watching
 him, and thus thinking of past days, she became so moved that she shrank
 back against the jamb of the waggon- office doorway to which the steps
 gave access
---
, the shadow from it conveniently hiding her features.
---
She
 forgot her daughter till a touch from Elizabeth- Jane."
---
" Why-- O what?" She drew closer, and
---
Elizabeth- Jane had never been so much interested in anything in her life
 as in their present position, partly from the natural elation she felt
 at discovering herself akin to a coach; and
---
she gazed again at the
 scene.
---
-- I will look on and."

" I do n't think I can ever meet Mr. Henchard. how I thought I do n't wish."

," she ventured.


---
There was temper under the thin bland
 surface-- the temper which, artificially intensified, had banished a wife
 nearly a score of years before.


---
which
 attracted her both by their subject and by their accent
---
Elizabeth- Jane turned to her companion."
---
," she said.
---
She was surprised to find how irresolute her mother had become.
---
"," she murmured.
---
" I have seen--
---
As her mother did not reply Elizabeth- Jane's mind
---
Let," she said.
---
Her mother assented, and down the street they went.


---
I believe.
---
Elizabeth- Jane and her mother had arrived some twenty minutes earlier.

---
It would have been altogether optional
 but for the orders of the landlady, a person who sat in the bar,
 corporeally motionless, but with a flitting eye and quick ear, with
 which she observed and heard through the open door and hatchway the
 pressing needs of customers whom her husband overlooked though close at
 hand.
---
Elizabeth and her mother were passively accepted as sojourners,
 and.


---
" I fear
---
," said Elizabeth.
---
," replied her
 mother."
---
I much fear
---
" I know
---
what I'll do
---
And leaving the room, she descended the stairs and
.


---
If there was one good thing more than another which characterized this
 single- hearted girl
---
it was a willingness to sacrifice her personal
 comfort and dignity to the common weal.


---
mother's not well off
---
she asked of the landlady.


---
as if she had been
 melted into it when in a liquid state, and
---
The latter, as fixed in the arm- chair could not now be unstuck,
 looked the girl up and down inquiringly, with her hands on the
 chair- arms.
---
Elizabeth proposed
---
The mistress
 of the house, however, was an easy woman to strangers, and
---
she made no
 objection.
---
being instructed by nods and motions
 from the taciturn landlord as to where she could find the different
 things, trotted up and down stairs with materials for her own and her
 parent's meal
---
While she was doing this the wood partition in the centre of the house

---
As you seem busy here to- night, and mother's not well off, might I take
 out part of our accommodation by helping?""' Tis the Scotch gentleman," said the landlady omnisciently; and?
---
she brought
 forth the tray of supper viands
---
Thus Elizabeth found.


---
that the
 Scotchman was located in a room quite close to the small one that had
 been allotted to herself and her mother
---
When she entered
---
nobody was present but the young man himself-- the
 same whom she had seen lingering without the windows of the King's Arms
 Hotel.
---
so that she looked at him quite coolly, and, and the sort of velvet- pile or down that was on the skin
 at the back of his neck, and how his cheek was so truly curved as to be
 part of a globe, and how clearly drawn were the lids and lashes which
 hid his bent eyes
---
She set down the tray,.

---
who was as kind as she was fat
 and lazy
---
though in her
 earnestness to be useful she was waiving her own needs altogether
---
that she and
 her mother had
---
Elizabeth fetched their simple provisions,.
---
as she had fetched the
 Scotchman's, and
---
where she had left her
 mother,
---
where she
 had left her
---
At Elizabeth's
 entry she lifted her finger.


---
The room allotted to the two
 women.
---
her mother
 whispered,"' Tis he."


---
as she drew near
---
" Who?" said the girl.


---
The girl noiselessly laid
 out their little meal, and.


---
her attention being fixed on the
 conversation through the door
---
Elizabeth- Jane and her mother remained each in her
 thoughts over their meal,.
---
also that used
 by her mother and herself
---
, she found the bustle of serving to be at its
 height below,.
---
The young woman shrank from
 and.
---
In the general sitting- room,, she
 remarked the two or three dozen strong- backed chairs that stood round
 against the wall,
---
; the sanded
 floor; the black settle, permitted Elizabeth.


---
without herself being particularly seen
---
Among the latter she noticed
 some of those personages who had stood outside the windows of the King's
 Arms.


---
before she came down
---
; she could not help;
 and
---
the longer she listened the more she was enraptured.
---
She had never
 heard any singing like this and
---
till she could
 imagine a tear in his eye
---
the waiststring of which was overhung so far by
 her sides
---
which movement she accomplished by rolling herself round, as a cask

---
" she asked.


---
As she looked at Farfrae from the
 back of the settle
---
she decided.
---
She admired the serious light in which he looked at
 serious things.
---
She
 disliked those wretched humours of Christopher Coney and his tribe; and

---
exactly as she felt about
 life and its surroundings
---
whereupon the landlady whispered to Elizabeth
---
She took a candlestick and.
---
When, candle in hand,
 she reached the top of the stairs on her way down again
---
She could not very well retreat; they met and
.


---
She must have appeared interesting in some way--
---
for she was

---
a girl, with which
 simple drapery accorded well.
---
Her face flushed, too, at the slight
 awkwardness of the meeting, and
---
she passed him with her eyes bent on the
 candle- flame.
---
that she carried just below her nose
---
When soon after,
 the girl rejoined her mother
---
"," she whispered( that the Scotch- man might not
 overhear).
---
her
 mother had.
---
she known the real relationship,
---
," she said,
---
Thus she earnestly pleaded.


---
the mellow
 air brought in the feel of imminent autumn almost as distinctly as if
 she had been in the remotest hamlet
---
Hearing voices,, she withdrew her head
 and.
---
She saw.
---
" gone," she said to herself.
---
" I was nothing
 to him, and
---
when the Scotchman came out at the
 door he had by accident glanced up at her
---
"," she said,.


---
when she turned inwards
---
" Yes; I am thinking of Mr. Henchard's sudden liking for that young man.

---
What had brought her to this determination
---
," she enjoined,, bonnet on, ready
 to depart
---
I almost feel, and
---
that I would rather he did say so,
---
as I have

---
Thus with a half- hearted willingness, a smothered
 reluctance, did the poor forgiving woman start her unconscious daughter
 on this errand.


---
when Elizabeth paced up the
 High Street, in no great hurry
---
; for to herself her position was only
 that of a poor relation deputed to hunt up a rich one.
---
Very little inquiry was necessary to guide her footsteps.
---
as in other houses, she could see through the
 passage to the end of the garden-- nearly a quarter of a mile off
---
She was
 conducted into the mossy garden, and through a door in the wall, which
 was studded with rusty nails speaking of generations of fruit- trees that
 had been trained there.
---
here she was

---
as she could
---
she had seen
---
She wandered about this place, uncomfortably conscious of the impending
 interview,
---
till she was quite weary of searching
---
; she ventured to
 inquire of a boy in what quarter.
---
she was answered by a cry of" Come in
---
Elizabeth turned the handle; and
---
there stood before her,.
---
Having toned her feelings and arranged words on her lips for Mr.
 Henchard, and for him alone, she was.


---
She said.


---
she wanted
---
her sit down
---
where the
 younger of them has already been discovered by Elizabeth
---
While she still sat under the Scotchman's eyes
---
She could hear his words to
 Henchard:" Joshua Jopp, sir-- by appointment-- the new manager."

"
---
She could see.


---
until they rested on her figure
---
Now then,
 what is it, my young woman?"
---
" said she.


---
" Yes-- I suppose.
---
" I am sent
---
to tell you, sir," she innocently went on,"."


---
" Oh-- Susan is-- still alive?"
---
" Are you her daughter?"


---
His wife had behaved kindly to him
 in return for his unkindness, and.


---
It was with a gentle delicacy of manner, surprising to Elizabeth,.
---
Your mother,
 then, is quite well?"


---
" She is sir, with travelling."


---
she come
 from abroad-- America or Australia?
---
And where is your mother staying?"


---
" suddenly
 turning away with a wet eye," you shall take a note from me to your
 mother.
---
She is not left very well off by
 her late husband?"
---
," she said,
---
that she,, was much affected, and
---
tears rose to her
 aerial- grey eyes
---
that she was gone
---
that, as
 regarded her, at least, there could be little doubt
---
And a few hours
 would settle the question of her mother's identity
---
In the meantime Elizabeth had reached the inn.
---
Her mother, instead of
 taking the note with the curiosity of a poor woman expecting assistance,
 was much moved at sight of it.
---
She did not read it at once,, and
---
Elizabeth's back was turned.
---
when her mother opened the letter
---
The girl seems.
---
; it may tacitly have said to her.
---
She waited restlessly for the close of the day,;.
---
that she was invited
---
that she would
 go alone
---
But she said nothing to show that the place of meeting was not
 at his house, nor.



---
did she hand the note to Elizabeth.




11
---
that at a certain stage of the burning her
 heart burst and leapt out of her body, to the terror of them all, and
 that not one of those ten thousand people ever cared particularly for
 hot roast after that
---
her bow her head in acknowledgment
---
that she understood
---
said Susan,.


---
It is only that which makes me feel' ee an
 innocent woman.
---
" she asked,.


---
She can not be told all
---
-- she would so despise us both
!"


---
that-- I could not bear it
---
why she was brought up in ignorance of you
---
I could not bear
 it either."


---
" Well-- we must talk of a plan for keeping her in her present belief, and

---
I am in a large
 way of business here--
---
that I am Mayor of the town, and
---
I do n't know what all?"


---
" Yes," she murmured.


---
" These things, as well as the dread of the girl discovering our
 disgrace, makes it necessary to act with extreme caution.
---
So that I
 do n't see; and
---
as the wife and
 daughter I once treated badly
---
I only came to see--"

" No, no, Susan
---
that you and Elizabeth take a
 cottage in the town as the widow Mrs. Newson and her daughter; that I
 meet you, court you, and marry you
---
," she said meekly.
---
I came here
 for the sake of Elizabeth
---
"; for myself, to leave again
 to- morrow morning never come near you more, I am content to go."


---
" Quite," said she.


---
" And the girl is quite safe from learning the shame of her case and
 ours?--
---
" You would be surprised to find how unlikely she is to dream of the
 truth.
---
How could she ever suppose such a thing?"


---
I like the idea of repeating our marriage
---
said his wife anxiously.
---
I can find my
 way back
---
She murmured something; but
---
while his
 wife passed out through the lower way
---
she was walking
 at my side,, our only child.
---
" Well-- no wife could I hear of in all that time; and
---
And now-- she has come back."


---
" Come back, has she!"


---
for she
 was of good family, the daughter of some
 harum- scarum military officer who had got into difficulties, and
---
she took upon
 herself.
---
From that she got.

---
But being together in the same
 house, and her feeling warm, we got naturally intimate.
---
She was terribly careless of
 appearances, and
---
she suffered much on my account, and.
---
if she would run the risk of Susan being alive( very slight as I
 believed) and
---
She jumped for joy, and
---
no doubt soon have been married-- but, behold, Susan appears!"


---
this giddy girl devote herself to me over at Jersey, to the
 injury of her name
---
My first
 duty is to Susan
---
she cannet be your wife,

---
; that ye cannet see her more; and."


---
that-- ye
 wish her weel
---
My wife Susan has my daughter
 with her-- the baby that was in her arms at the fair; and
---
this girl knows
 nothing of me beyond that.
---
She
 has grown up in the belief that the sailor to whom I made over her
 mother, and who is now dead, was her father, and her mother's husband.

---
What her mother has always felt
---
, she and I together feel now--.

---
that we
 ca n't proclaim our disgrace to the girl by letting her know the truth
---
She'll forgive ye
 both."


---
her know the truth
---
Susan looks upon
 herself as the sailor's widow, and and
---
she's right."


---
as the mother and daughter were comfortably installed
---
During the entertainment Elizabeth was
---
though his wife was not particularly happy in it
---
The poor woman smiled faintly
---
; she did not enjoy pleasantries on a
 situation into which she had entered solely for the sake of her girl's
 reputation.
---
She liked them so little, indeed,.
---
that there was room for
 wonder why she had countenanced deception at all, and
---
the girl know her history
---
she said,"!"
---
I am afraid all this is taking up your time and
 giving trouble-- when I did not expect any such thing
---
And she looked at
 him and at his dress as a man of affluence, and at the furniture he had
 provided for the room-- ornate and lavish to her eyes.


---
That such a poor fragile woman should be.
---
when
 she stepped into the plain brougham which drew up at the door on the
 wedding- day to take her and Elizabeth- Jane to church
---
while a woman of your tonnage have not
---
" True; your mother was a very good woman
---
She were
 rewarded by the Agricultural Society for having begot the greatest
 number of healthy children without parish assistance, and other virtuous
 marvels."

"' Twas that that kept us so low upon ground-- that great hungry family."


---
how mother would sing
---
how we went with her to the
 party at Mellstock
---
because her face were
 so yaller and freckled
---
And canst mind"-- she
 prodded Solomon's shoulder with her finger- tip,, and
---
while her eyes twinkled
 between the crevices of their, and the
 zilver- snuffers
---
her fall
---
" She'll wish her cake dough afore
.
---
she's done of him
---
Lest she should pine for deeper
 affection
---
the two unassuming women
 scarcely made a perceptible addition to its contents.


---
she
 experienced
---
with which she was treated
---
The freedom, the indulgence, went beyond her
 expectations.
---
to which her mother's
 marriage had introduced her
---
The reposeful, easy, affluent life was, in truth, the beginning of a great
 change in Elizabeth.
---
She found and,."
---
she could have nice personal possessions
 and ornaments for the asking,
---
alas, she had not
---
as the winter and spring passed by her thin
 face and figure filled out in rounder and softer curves
---
; the lines and
 contractions upon her young brow went away; the muddiness of skin which
 she had looked upon as her lot by nature departed with a change to
 abundance of good things, and a bloom came upon her cheek.
---
Perhaps, too,
 her grey, thoughtful eyes revealed an arch gaiety sometimes; but
---
Like all people, light- heartedness seemed to her too irrational
 and inconsequent then; for she had been too early habituated to anxious reasoning to drop
 the habit suddenly.
---
She felt none of those ups and downs of spirit
 which beset so many people without cause;
---
but she well knew; and
---
her present cheerfulness was fairly proportionate to her
 solid guarantees for the same.


---
that, given a girl rapidly becoming
 good- looking, comfortably circumstanced, and for the first time in her
 life commanding ready money, she would go and.
---
that Elizabeth
 did was nowhere more conspicuous than in this question of clothes
---
This
 unsophisticated girl did it by an innate perceptiveness that was almost
 genius.
---
Thus she refrained from bursting out like a water- flower that
 spring, and clothing herself in puffings and knick- knacks,.
---
as most of
 the Casterbridge girls would have done in her circumstances
---
Her triumph
 was tempered by circumspection
---
, she had still that field- mouse fear of
 the coulter of destiny despite fair promise, which is common among the
 thoughtful who have suffered early from poverty and oppression.


---
" she would say to herself.
---
We now see her in a black silk bonnet, velvet mantle or silk spencer,
 dark dress, and carrying a sunshade.
---
In this latter article she drew
 the line at fringe, and.
---
She
 discovered.

---
that with the clarification of her complexion and the birth
 of pink cheeks her skin had grown more sensitive to the sun's rays
---
She protected those cheeks forthwith,.


---
she went out with him more
 frequently than with her mother now.
---
Her appearance one day was so
 attractive that he looked at her critically.


---
," she faltered,

---
rather as your mother advises ye
---
she appeared with her hair.
---
when she was a baby
---
She looked startled,?"


---
as Elizabeth was gone to her own room Henchard resumed
---
that the girl's hair
 certainly looked,
---
when she was a baby
---
And the same uneasy expression came out on her face, to which
 the future held the key.
---
her called
 Miss Henchard-- not Miss Newson
---
-- it is her legal name--
---
so it may as well be made her usual
 name
---
She
 wo n't object."


---
if she's
 willing
---
if she agrees
---
" O yes-- let," she replied.


---
that her manner was emotional and full of the
 earnestness of one who wishes to do right at great hazard
---
She went to
 Elizabeth- Jane, whom she found sewing in her own sitting- room upstairs,
 and."
---
what had been proposed about her surname
---
Elizabeth reflected.
---
I'll think of it, mother
---
"," she answered.


---
When, later in the day, she saw Henchard
---
, she adverted to the matter
 at once, in a way which showed that the line of feeling started by her
 mother had been persevered in."
---
she asked.


---
you women make about

---
I proposed it
---
if I care
---
Elizabeth still passed as Miss Newson, and not by her legal
 name
---
She saw.
---
Occasionally she would hear
 a perfect cannonade of laughter from Henchard, arising from something
.
---
One day, looking
 down on their figures from on high, she heard the latter remark,, that their habit of
 walking and driving about together rather neutralized Farfrae's value
 as a second pair of eyes, which should be used in places where the
 principal was not."'
---
When she walked with her mother
---
, on the other hand, she often beheld the
 Scotchman looking at them with a curious interest.
---
Besides, it was at her mother more particularly than
 at herself.
---
she decided
.


---
She did not divine the ample explanation of his manner, without personal
 vanity,.
---
who walked by her side
---
Her conjectures on that past
 never went further than faint ones based on things casually heard and
 mere guesses that Henchard and her mother might have been lovers
 in their younger days, who had quarrelled and parted.


---
, she thought.
---
as she had put on her bonnet
---
However, she entered and.
---
Presently she saw a figure approaching
 the gate-- that of Donald Farfrae.
---
not to meet him there
 alone, she quickly ascended the step- ladder leading to the granary
 door, and.
---
where she had just been standing
---
; could it be herself?
---
she had herself received
---
the longer she waited the
 more awkward.
---
she had been in hiding there
---
that she still waited on
---
A winnowing machine stood close
 beside her, and
---
she gently moved the handle
---
to relieve her suspense;
 whereupon a cloud of wheat husks flew out into her face, and.
---
," she faltered,
---
Elizabeth held
 out her note.


---
"' Tis a great liberty," said Elizabeth.


---
I would n't stand;

---
", I suppose, Mr. Farfrae?
---
" she inquired.


---
Why would I be?"


---
" I only supposed;
---
I did sing there--
---
O no,
 I do n't want!
---
Yet I'll sing the song to you wi' pleasure
.
---
I could sing it now, and?
---
But I fear rain or no."


---
I must go--
---
As Elizabeth neither assented nor
---
dissented Donald Farfrae began blowing
 her back hair, and her side hair, and her neck, and the crown of her
 bonnet, and the fur of her victorine, Elizabeth saying,""
  at every puff.
---
At last she was fairly clean,.


---
She declined the offer,.
---
that she was but a poor illustrative instance of
 the prophet Baruch's sly definition
---
When she walked abroad
---
she seemed.
---
She formed
 curious resolves on checking gay fancies in the matter of clothes,
.
---
because it was inconsistent with her past life
---
she had become
---
She wanted, but
---
she had no bonnet that would harmonize.
---
As an artistic
 indulgence she thought.
---
she would have such a bonnet
---
When she had a
 bonnet that would go with the gloves she had no dress that would go with
 the bonnet.
---
to finish; she ordered the
 requisite article, and.
---
that she had no sunshade to go with the
 dress
---
In for a penny in for a pound; she bought the sunshade, and
---
that her bygone simplicity was
 the art that conceals art, the" delicate imposition" of Rochefoucauld;
 she had produced an effect, a contrast
---
for as
 soon as Casterbridge thought her artful
---
it thought her worth notice
---
"," she said
 to herself;".
---
; sex had never before asserted itself in her so strongly,
 for in former days she had perhaps been too impersonally human to be
 distinctively feminine.
---
After an unprecedented success one day she came

---
indoors, went upstairs, and leant upon her bed face downwards quite
 forgetting the possible creasing and damage."
---
Good Heaven," she
 whispered,
---
Here am I setting up as the town beauty!"


---
When she had thought it over
---
, her usual fear of exaggerating appearances
 engendered a deep sadness.
---
what an unfinished girl I am
---
She looked from the window and.
---
Elizabeth saw no more of them.


---
when some of the women were a- walking home
---
every girl being in a coming- on disposition towards one who so
 thoroughly understood the poetry of motion as he
---
Among the rest of the
 onlookers were Elizabeth and her mother-- the former thoughtful yet
 much interested,.
---
her eyes beaming with a longing lingering light,
---
till
 his wife should be disposed
---
The tune
 had enticed her into it;
---
the girl looked at Henchard for approval; but

---
that in assenting to
 dance she had made a mistake of some kind
---
she did

---
what it was till a hint from a nodding acquaintance enlightened
 her
---
, she learnt
---
As the Mayor's step- daughter, she had not been quite in
 her place in treading a measure amid such a mixed throng as filled the
 dancing pavilion.


---
that her tastes were not good enough for her
 position, and
---
This made her very miserable, and
---
she looked about for her mother;
 but
---
who had less idea of conventionality than Elizabeth
 herself
---
her face being to- wards the shine
 from the tent
---
She thought but.
---
She faltered," Why?"


---
She said.


---
she could not dance-- in any proper way
---
I fear!
---
I offended your father by
 getting up this
---
And now, perhaps, I'll have
---
I wish, Miss Newson; and
---
I was richer
---
" offended, I would ask you something in a short time--.
---
yes, I would ask
 you to- night
---
instead of encouraging
 him she remained incompetently silent.
---
"" Never," said she.


---
" I wonder!"


---
I
 hope.
---
if I go
---
" That I'm sure we wo n't!"
---
she said earnestly.
---
" I-- wish."


---
" Now, I'll think over that."
---
what
 she was doing
---
Without any consciousness of she started."
---
till she reached
 her father's door
---
" she thought, breathless.


---
as she pulled
 up
---
Indoors she fell.
---
Elizabeth, that
 silent observing woman, had long noted.
---
she had feared
---
so that the announcement gave
 her little surprise
---
she took indoors, and
---
presently writing on a
 loose slip" Elizabeth- Jane," she laid the latter over" Sir,"."
---
When she saw the effect
---
a quick red ran up
 her face and.
---
what she
 had done
---
She quickly tore up the slip, and.
---
After this
 she grew cool and
---
Elizabeth- Jane's anxiety to know
 reached a pitch that disturbed
 her, for she could no longer conceal from herself the cause.
---
At length
 the news reached her.
---
Her heart fluttered; and
---
when she heard of this step of Donald's,
---
who cared one little bit
 for her
---
whether her appearance on the evening of the dance
 were such as
---
To solve the problem to inspire a fleeting love at first sight, she dressed
 herself up-- the muslin, the spencer, the
 sandals, the para- sol-- and
---
exactly as she had dressed then
---
was in her opinion, precisely of such a kind as to inspire that fleeting
 regard, and no more--"just enough to make him silly, and not enough
 to keep him so," she said luminously; and
---
Elizabeth thought, in a much
 lower key,.


---
when she felt
---
Hence,, she would say to
 herself with a mock pleasantry that carried an ache with it," No, no,
 Elizabeth- Jane--!"
---
She tried.


---
I'm a friend of his-- or
---
if I've not been his friend, who has, I should
 like to know
---
Did n't I keep him here
---
Did n't I help him to
 money, or
---
I stuck out for no terms--
---
when she entered she

---
She hesitated for a moment, and
---
When she had gone
---
She on her part has promised; and
---
his wife had not ventured.


---
which she, for many reasons, would have welcomed gladly
---
If at breakfast or dinner Elizabeth- Jane's mother inadvertently
 alluded to her favourite's movements
---
, the girl would implore her by a
 look to be silent; and
---
There came a shock which had been foreseen for some time by Elizabeth,
.


---
Her mother was ill-- too unwell to leave her room.
---
who treated
 her kindly
---
In a day or two she rallied.


---
Elizabeth,, did not appear at breakfast on the
 second morning, and
---
that she at length perceived
---
she was bound
---
" On calm reflection, therefore," she went on
---
that you really did set before
 me in your grim way the fact of there being a certain risk in intimacy
 with you, slight as it seemed to be after fifteen or sixteen years of
 silence on your wife's part
---
" On calm reflection, therefore," she went on," I quite forgive you for
 landing me in such a dilemma,. I thus look upon the whole as a misfortune
 of mine, and not a fault of yours.

" So that, Michael, I must ask you with which I
 pestered you day after day in the heat of my feelings. whilst I thought your conduct to me cruel now I know more
 particulars of the position you were in I see.

" Now you will, I am sure,. I know
 and I can trust you. To this end may I request you, particularly the letters written in the first
 abandonment of feeling.

" For the handsome sum you forwarded to me as a plaster to the wound
---
She is rich,
 and
---
she had appointed
---
there was no Lucetta
 inside or out.
---
She could not
 go out of doors any more.
---
One day, after much thinking distress her, she said.
---
she wanted
---
A desk was put
 upon her bed with pen and paper, and
---
at her request she was left alone.

---
She remained,.

---
Upon my heart and soul, if ever I should be left in a position to
 carry out that marriage with thee, I OUGHT-- I ought!"

 She had directed it in these words:--

" MR.
---
The latter sat up with her mother to the utmost of her strength night
 after night.
---
Between the hours barring the rare
 sound of the watchman-- was broken in Elizabeth's ear only by the
 time- piece in the bedroom ticking frantically against the clock on the
 stairs;
---
while the subtle- souled girl asking herself
---
why she was
 born,
---
ticking harder and harder to clang like a gong;
 and all this why sitting in a room, and blinking at the candle; why things
 around her had taken the shape they wore in preference to every other
 possible shape.
---
Why they stared at her so helplessly,
---
which spun in her at
 this moment like a top
---
Her eyes fell together
---
;
 she was awake, yet
---
she was asleep.


---
A word from her mother roused her.
---
" Why?" said Elizabeth, with a start.


---
" I-- wanted."


---
Elizabeth- Jane bent down her head so much that she looked
 quite into her own lap.
---
as her mother did not go on
---
But, she said," What
 reason?"


---
" Well, I had a reason.'
---
I wish!
---
I do n't know
---
"-- I do n't know."
---
After this her mother was silent, and
; and
---
she spoke on the subject no more.


---
who had been standing there for
 an indefinite time with her pitcher
---
as she had learnt them from the nurse
---
" And she was white as marble- stone
---
Yes,' says she,', and
---
when I'm gone, and,' she said.'
---
for I should n't like it
---
as I
 am carried out
---
Well, poor soul; she's helpless
---
" And all her shining keys will be took from her,
 and
---
her cupboards opened; and
---
her wishes and ways will all be as nothing!"




19.



---
" Elizabeth, do you think much of old times?
---
" said Henchard.

" Yes, sir; often," she said.


---
Ah! I am out of all
?
---
that, am I not
---
," she said quickly.
---
" I can think of no other as my
 father, except my father."


---
Henchard's wife was dissevered from him by death; his friend and helper
 Farfrae by estrangement; Elizabeth- Jane by ignorance.
---
that was the girl
---
" What did your mother tell you about me-- my history?"
---
" She should have told more--!
---
The back of Elizabeth's head remained still, and her shoulders did not
 denote even the movements of breathing.
---
Your mother and I were man and wife.
---
Your mother was too honest.
---
which a whole series of slight and
 unregarded incidents in her past life strangely corroborated
---
to give details; when, in
 short, she believed,
---
she became greatly agitated,
 and turning round to the table
---
She tried; but
---
she could not
---
to stand up and comfort him trustfully; she
 was troubled at his presence, like the brethren at the avowal of Joseph.


---
I; your
 mother wanted it Susan.
---
she heard.
---
Before she had moved, or in
 any way recovered from the effect of his disclosure
---
Your mother was against it, but
---
" she asked.


---
" I wonder?"


---
why mother did n't wish it
---
as I shall tell you
---
" I can see by the firelight
---
," she answered.
---
She got a piece of paper, and
---
before the bewildered girl could realize, or
---
She was
 thankful that he had left her to herself for the evening, and sat down
 over the fire.
---
Here she remained in silence, and.


---
to whom she seemed

---
Elizabeth was
 his at last
---
and she was a girl of such good sense and kind heart.
---
that
 she would be sure to like him
---
In sealing up the sheet, tucked in without an envelope, in the old- fashioned way, she had

---
Some trifling fancy or other of poor Susan's" he
 said; and
---
No; she died three months after that, and
---
she filled up the ache I felt at the other's loss.
---
as she forgives you
---
For the good of all three of us I have kept one thing
 a secret from you till now. I hope you will understand why; I think you
, I have
 I shall be in my grave, and
 how I was
 situated I can hardly write it, but I christened her by the same name we had given to the first,
 and Michael, I
 am dying, and I might have held my tongue; but I could not." I am to suffer, I perceive."" This
 much scourging, then, it is for me."
---
It furnished another
 illustration of that honesty in dishonesty which had characterized her
 in other things.


---
She was breathing profoundly.
---
that it fell slantwise on her face without
 shining on her eyes
---
His wife
 was dead, and
---
his daughter she should always think herself, no matter
 what hyprocrisy it involved.


---
Elizabeth advanced with open
 confidence to him and.


---
thought all night of it," she said frankly."
---
And I
 see.
---
And I am going.

---
if I had only been
 your step- daughter
---
whom my poor mother married by such
 a strange mistake
---
( she spoke with tears in her eyes);
" but
---
she said cheerfully.


---
which ever confronted a girl
---
Elizabeth's was her occasional pretty and picturesque use of dialect
 words-- those terrible marks of the beast to the truly genteel.


---
she happened to

---
wishing to show him something,", I'll get it
---
She reddened with shame and sadness.


---
" I meant' in a low, humble
 voice."
---
," she said,
---
I ought."


---
The sharp reprimand was not lost upon her, and
---
she said;
---
that she no longer spoke of
" dumbledores" but of" humble bees"
---
that
 she grew
---
when she had
 not slept
---
that she did not quaintly tell the servants next morning
---
that she
 had been" hag- rid," but
---
that she had" suffered from indigestion
---
A gratuitous ordeal was in store for her in the
 matter of her handwriting.
---
She was passing the dining- room door one
 evening, and.
---
till she
 had opened the door that she knew the Mayor was there in the company of

---
" Here, Elizabeth- Jane looking round at her" just write down

---
She brought forward blotting- book, paper, and ink, and.


---
She started the pen in an elephantine march across the sheet.
---
It was a
 splendid round, bold hand of her own conception,
---
a style stamped a woman as Minerva's own in more recent days.
---
that proper young girls wrote

---
Her considerate disposition became a pitfall to her now.
---
She was,.
---
She would go to the kitchen instead
 of ringing,"."
---
She went down on
 her knees, shovel in hand,
---
;
 moreover, she would persistently thank the parlour- maid for everything,
 till one day,!
---
as the girl was gone from the room
---
as if she
 were
---
Elizabeth shrank so visibly at the exclamation that he became
 sorry a few minutes after, and.


---
The increasing frequency of the
 latter mood told her the sad news that he disliked her with a growing
 dislike.
---
that her appearance and manners became
 under the softening influences which she could now command, and
---
in her
 wisdom did command
---
The more interesting, the more she seemed.
---
Sometimes she
 caught him.
---
that she could
 hardly bear
---
Elizabeth had latterly
.
---
,, she at once set

---
Do n't I pay her a dozen pound a year?"" Elizabeth, come here!"
---
she obeyed.


---
Coming to the door she cried regardless of consequences,"
---
" Then she must have had more charity than sense
---
.

" O no, she had n't.'
---
that
 she could comfortably scratch her elbows
---
that she was
---
she had resolved

---
Elizabeth followed him to the house like a culprit; but
---
when
 she got inside
---
she could not see him.
---
Nor did she see him again
---
how she made use of those
 silent hours
---
She read and.

---
She began the study of Latin, incited by the Roman characteristics of
 the town she lived in.
---
" well- informed," she would say to herself through the tears that would
 occasionally glide down her peachy cheeks when she was fairly baffled by
 the portentous obscurity of many of these educational works.


---
Thus she lived on, a dumb, deep- feeling, great- eyed creature, construed
 by not a single contiguous being;.
---
True, that for reasons best known to herself,
 she had,.


---
which she had occupied with such
 zest) to a front chamber overlooking the street
---
She seized on these days for her periodical visits to the spot
 where her mother lay buried-- the still- used burial- ground of the old
 Roman- British city, whose curious feature was this, its continuity as a
 place of sepulture.
---
Half- past ten in the morning was about her hour for seeking this spot-- a
 time when the town avenues were deserted as the avenues of Karnac.

---
There, approaching her mother's grave she saw a solitary dark figure in
 the middle of the gravel- walk.
---
The personage was in mourning like herself, but
 for the fact that it was a lady much more beautifully dressed than she.

---
unless for some temporary whim or purpose, her eyes were arrested by
 the artistic perfection of the lady's appearance
---
Her gait, too, had
 a flexuousness about it, which seemed to avoid angularity.
---
It was a
 revelation to Elizabeth that human beings could reach this stage of
 external development
---
-- she had never suspected it.
---
She felt.
---
all the
 freshness and grace to be stolen from herself on the instant by the
 neighbourhood of such a stranger
---
And this was in face of the fact that
 Elizabeth could now have been writ handsome, while the young lady was
 simply pretty.


---
Had she been envious
---
she might have hated the woman; but
---
she did not
 do that
---
-- she allowed herself the pleasure of feeling fascinated.
---
She
 wondered.
---
that
 this figure was no Casterbridge woman's,
---
even if a book in her hand
 resembling a guide- book had not also suggested it
---
Elizabeth went to the tomb
 herself
---
She returned homeward,
.


---
what she had seen
---
as she might have mused on a rainbow or the
 Northern Lights, a rare butterfly or a cameo
---
She clapped her hand to her mouth, but too late.


---
after this was by recalling the lady she had seen that day, and
---
she might see her again
---
if you care for her
---
she was startled by the
 apparition of Farfrae, who passed outside the gate
---
Unduly depressed by a sense of her own superfluity
---
she thought; and
---
She fell into painful thought on her position, which ended with her
 saying quite loud," O, I wish I was dead with dear mother!"


---
, she looked round, and
---
a face was bending over her,
 veiled, but still distinct, the face of the young woman she had seen
 yesterday.


---
she had been

---
though there was pleasure in her confusion
---
" I don't-- I ca n't tell you," said Elizabeth, face to hide a quick flush that had come.


---
; then the girl felt.


---
that
 the young lady was sitting down beside her
---
" I guess
---
" That was your mother."
 
---
She waved her hand towards the tombstone.
---
Elizabeth looked up at her as
.
---
that the girl decided there
---
" It was my mother," she said," my only friend."

" But your father, Mr. Henchard.
---
I was--" I swept up the coals
; and I said I was leery;-- and."

" she said ingenuously."
---
" O no; certainly not BAD," agreed the honest girl."
---
since mother died
---
, I daresay;
 and
---
Elizabeth- Jane looked wistfully at her questioner.
---
She found.
---
that her
 questioner was looking at her,
---
"," she
 said.
---
" And yet I can tell it,."


---
The lady assured her
---
that she did want
---
to know; whereupon Elizabeth- Jane
 told the tale of her life.


---
as she understood it, which was in general the
 true one, except that the sale at the fair had no part therein
---
Contrary to the girl's expectation her new friend was not.
---
This
 cheered her; and
---
till she thought of returning to that home

---
in which she had been treated so roughly of late
---
that her spirits fell
---
" I do n't know
---
how to return," she murmured.
---
" I think of going away.
---
But
 what can I do?
---
Where can I go?"


---
," said her friend gently.
---
" So I would
 not go far. Now what do you think of this: I shall soon want somebody to
 live in my house, partly as housekeeper, partly as companion But perhaps--"

" O yes," cried Elizabeth, with tears in her eyes.
---
" I would, indeed-- I
 would do anything to be independent;" I am no accomplished person. But I ca n't help, when I do n't mean
 to."

" Never mind, I shall like."

" And-- O, I know I sha n't do!"--she cried with a distressful laugh." I
 accidentally learned." What, not necessary to write ladies'-hand?" cried the joyous Elizabeth.


---
Elizabeth expressed her astonishment.


---
Elizabeth, her eyes shining at this prospect of a change from an
 unbearable position, joyfully assented; and
---
though her ears
 had heard its name on a hundred occasions
---
In the
 afternoon she had occasion to pay a few bills in the town and do a
 little shopping when she learnt that what was a new discovery to
 herself.
---
her being
 a customer
---
Elizabeth- Jane could, however, add a capping touch to information so new
 to her in the bulk.
---
, she said,
---
as to render
 chimneys, attics, and roofs invisible, Elizabeth, almost with a lover's
 feeling, thought.
---
she would like
---
She went up the street in that direction.


---
Elizabeth's eyes sought the upper rooms, and.
---
that this woman of comparatively
 practised manner had made upon the studious girl's mind
---
The impression was so deep that
 she enjoyed standing under an opposite archway merely to think that the
 charming lady was inside the confronting walls, and to wonder what
 she was doing.
---
Her admiration for the architecture of that front was
 entirely on account of the inmate it screened.
---
Elizabeth trotted through the open door in the dusk,
 but.
---
she went quickly out again by
 another which stood open in the lofty wall of the back court
---
To her
 surprise she found herself in one of the little- used alleys of the town.

---
which had given her egress
---
Looking round at the door, by the light of
 the solitary lamp fixed in the alley, she saw older even than the house itself.
---
The appearance was so ghastly by the weakly
 lamp- glimmer that she could not bear to look at it-- the first unpleasant
 feature of her visit.


---
She turned, but hearing footsteps approaching in that quarter, and
 having no great wish to be found in such a place at such a time she
 quickly retreated.
---
she stood behind a brick
 pier.


---
Had she watched.
---
she would have been
---
She would have seen that
 the pedestrian on coming up made straight for the arched doorway: that
 as he paused with his hand upon the latch the lamplight fell upon the
 face of Henchard.


---
that she discerned
 nothing of this
---
as she
 was ignorant of his identity, and
---
Elizabeth
 came out a second time into the alley, and.


---
; the events of the
 day had urged her to the course.
---
she anxiously awaited his manner towards her.
---
She found.
---
she asked.


---
She thought it undesirable and unnecessary to say anything at present
 about her destination to one who took so little interest in her.
---
I have heard of an opportunity of getting
 more cultivated and finished, and being less idle
---
"," she answered,
 with hesitation."
---
where I can have
 advantages of study, and
---
She thanked him for this offer.


---
She now simply waited.


---
Elizabeth- Jane
 having now changed her orbit from one of gay independence to laborious
 self- help
---
if her friend would only face it-- a matter of doubt
---
She went to
 the boot- room where her pattens had hung ever since her apotheosis; took
 them down,.
---
as she
 had done in old times
---
Thus mounted, and with cloak and umbrella, she
 went off to the place of appointment--.


---
wherein she had met many months earlier
---
Under
 the projection of the thatch she saw a figure.
---
Her presence so exceptionally substantiated the girl's utmost hopes that
 she almost feared her good fortune.
---
Here, in a churchyard old as civilization, in the worst of
 weathers, was a strange woman of curious fascinations never seen
 elsewhere
---
: there might be some devilry about her presence.
---
However,
 Elizabeth went on to the church tower, on whose summit the rope of a
 flagstaff rattled in the wind; and
---
thus she came to the wall.


---
The lady had such a cheerful aspect in the drizzle that Elizabeth forgot
 her fancy."
---
Well," said the lady, a little of the whiteness of her teeth
 appearing with the word through the black fleece that protected her
 face,
---
" I think I might be able to," said the girl,.


---
Both the women listened.


---
At last she said suddenly,"?"


---
" I thought it safer to get away first-- as he is so uncertain in his
 temper."


---
Besides, I have never told you my name.
---
I shall expect you to- day-- this evening,
."


---
" Which way shall I come, ma'am?"


---
Elizabeth- Jane shook her head."
---
On consideration I do n't fear it
---
," she
 said sadly."
---
as she passed them
---
she explained through the carriage
 window.


---
she said
 with spirit.


---
that all her things had not yet been brought down
---
since she had occupied it
---
Evidences of her care, of her endeavours for improvement, were
 visible all around, in the form of books, sketches, maps, and little
 arrangements for tasteful effects.
---
she said, with deep concern."
---
What have I done?"


---
" I ca n't tell you now.
---
But go on living as my
 daughter, I'll tell you all in time."


---
She was in the fly--."
---
whose manner had such
 charms for her
---
," she said,
---
as she could
---
Father as considerately," I
 think it best for us.
---
that I go on now
---
I need not stay long
---
; I shall not
 be far away, and
---
I can soon come back again."


---
I
 wish?
---
Or am I?"


---
She repeated the words.
---
she signified to the flyman
---
when Elizabeth- Jane was contemplating her stealthy
 reconnoitring excursion to the abode of the lady of her fancy
---
The self- repression, the resignation of her
 previous communication had vanished from her mood
---
; she wrote with
 some of the natural lightness which had marked her in their early
 acquaintance.



---
Poor
 woman, she seems.
---
As soon she was no more
---
Lucetta is related to her."
---
, I suppose,"
  Miss Le Sueur had been the name under which he
 had known Lucetta-- or" Lucette," as she had called herself at that time.


---
that Lucetta had not as yet settled in
---
that Lucetta had been sublimed into a lady of means by some munificent
 testament on the part of this relative
---
, the possibility
 lent a charm to her image which
 it might not otherwise have acquired.
---
Lucetta was,.



---
Elizabeth gone
 away
---
," she said," and comfortable
---
I am going
---
My good Aunt Templeman, the banker's widow, whose
 very existence to doubt, much more her affluence, has lately
 died, and.
---
I will not enter into
 details.


---
that I have taken her name-- as a means of escape
 from mine, and its wrongs
---
" I am now my own mistress, and.
---
I
 have thought better of this.


---
have
 doubtless laughed at the-- what shall I call it?--
---
her to live with me
---
But my first meeting with
 her was purely an accident.
---
partly why I have done
 it
---
She is a dear, good girl, and

---
she thinks.
---
you have treated her with undue severity
---
I am not disposed to upbraid you.--
---
She was
 plainly in a very coming- on disposition for marriage.
---
But what else
 could a poor woman be?

---
Probably conscience no less than affection had brought her here.
---
Lucetta was with Henchard
---
that she would be happy to
 see him the next day.


---
after all, she plainly had not expected him, and
---
These
 cursed women-- there's not an inch of straight grain in' em!"
---
On Elizabeth- Jane's arrival she had been phlegmatically asked by an
 elderly woman.
---
She replied with
 great earnestness.

---
that she would not think of giving that trouble, and

---
She was then conducted to the first floor on the landing, and.


---
She was probably some years older than
 Elizabeth, and.
---
The attitude had been so full of abandonment that she bounded up like a
 spring on hearing the door open.


---
that it was Elizabeth she lapsed into ease, and came across
 to her with a reckless skip that innate grace only prevented from being
 boisterous
---
"," she said,.


---
I have learnt
---
She gathered up the pack of cards,.


---
she asked.


---
I forgot,
---
" I
 was thinking of-- you, and me-- and
---
that I am here
---
Ah! never mind," she said.
---
" I'll lie here;
 and
---
Elizabeth drew up silently to the head of the sofa, but with obvious
 pleasure.
---
that though in years she was younger than her
 entertainer in manner and general vision
---
she seemed more of the sage.

---
Miss Templeman deposited herself on the sofa in her former flexuous
 position, and.


---
" I must tell you something,
---
" she said.
---
" I wonder.
---
I have only been mistress of a large house and fortune a little
 while."


---
" murmured Elizabeth- Jane, her countenance

---
" As a girl I lived about in garrison towns and elsewhere with my father,
.
---
till I was quite flighty and unsettled
---
I
 should not have mentioned this
---
had I not thought it best
---
She looked thoughtfully round the room-- at the little square
 piano with brass inlayings, at the window- curtains, at the lamp, at the
 fair and dark kings and queens on the card- table, and
---
Elizabeth's mind ran on acquirements to an almost morbid degree.
---
", no doubt," she said.
---
" I have not been
 able to get beyond a wretched bit of Latin yet."


---
since I was there
---
I went back and.
---
But I do n't value
 such past matters, and."


---
Lucetta's tongue had for a moment
---
She had arrived
 at Casterbridge as a Bath lady, and
---
there were obvious reasons why
 Jersey should drop out of her life.
---
But Elizabeth had tempted her to
 and
---
Lucetta's
 words went no further, and
---
after this day she was so much upon her
 guard that there appeared no chance of her identification with the young
 Jersey woman who had been Henchard's dear comrade at a critical time.

---
Not the least amusing of her safeguards was her resolute avoidance of a
 French word.
---
if one by accident came to her tongue more readily than
 its English equivalent
---
She shirked it with the suddenness of the weak
 Apostle at the accusation," Thy speech bewrayeth thee!"


---
Expectancy sat visibly upon Lucetta the next morning.
---
She dressed
 herself for Mr. Henchard, and
---
restlessly awaited his call before
 mid- day; she waited on through the afternoon.
---
But
 she did not tell Elizabeth.


---
that the person expected was the girl's
 stepfather
---
They sat in adjoining windows of the same room in Lucetta's great stone
 mansion, netting, and looking out upon the market, which formed an
 animated scene.
---
Elizabeth could see the crown of her stepfather's hat
 among the rest beneath, and.
---
that Lucetta watched the same
 object with yet intenser interest
---
said Lucetta,
---
Elizabeth replied vaguely, for an incident checked her.
---
She saw
---
" said Lucetta.

"
---
O, no," said her companion, a quick red shooting over her face.


---
Lucetta looked hard at her."
---
" she said.


---
Again Lucetta looked out.
---
" They are all farmers, I suppose?" she said.


---
she did not mention him.


---
, she thought.
---
though Lucetta repeated her dressing
 with scrupulous care
---
She got disheartened.
---
that Lucetta no longer bore towards Henchard all that warm allegiance
 which had characterized her in their first acquaintance
---
With strong social reasons on
 her side there had ceased.


---
since she had
 succeeded to fortune
---
At breakfast she said to
 Elizabeth- Jane quite coolly:.
---
" I imagine
---
I suppose?"


---
She shook her head."
---
," she said in a husky voice.


---
she believed
---
Elizabeth, wishing to shield the man to be her father from
 any charge of unnatural dislike, said" Yes."


---
Elizabeth nodded sadly.


---
Lucetta looked blank,.
---
Here was a disaster-- her ingenious scheme
 completely stultified.


---
I like your company much!"
---
" said Lucetta, as soon as she could speak.


---
" Yes, yes-- and so do I yours!"
---
Elizabeth chimed in soothingly.


---
" But-- but--" She could not finish the sentence, which was, naturally,
 that if Henchard had such a rooted dislike for the girl as now seemed to

---
Here she enumerated several commissions at
 sundry shops, which would occupy Elizabeth's time for the next hour or
 two, at least.


---
I forget where-- but
---
Elizabeth hastily put on her things and.
---
I wonder- day!"
---
she
 wants
---
she said sorrowfully.
---
as she went
---
That
 her absence, rather than her services or instruction, was in request
---
as she seemed
---
She had not been gone ten minutes.
---
when one of Lucetta's servants was

---
I am sadly disappointed that you have not come before,
---
for can I
 help anxiety about my own equivocal relation to you?-- especially now

---
my aunt's fortune has brought me more prominently before society?
---
I have
.
---
Say-- I
 shall be quite alone.


---
her mistress gave directions that if a
 gentleman called he was to be admitted at once, and.


---
Sentimentally she did not much care
---
with a sigh she arranged herself
 picturesquely in the chair; first this way, then.
---
that; next so that the
 light fell over her head
---
Next she flung herself on the couch in the
 cyma- recta curve which so became her, and
---
, she decided,
---
thus she remained.

---
Whereupon Lucetta, forgetting her curve,.
---
-- she had not seen Henchard
 since his( supposed) temporary parting from her in Jersey.


---
She could hear the servant showing the visitor into the room, shutting
 the door upon him, and leaving as if to go and look for her mistress.

---
Lucetta flung back the curtain with a nervous greeting.
---
that her visitor might be
---
A conjecture,
 flashed through Lucetta's mind; but
---
when she was on the point of bursting
 out
---
Lucetta blushed, and laugh on her face--"O
---
, I've made a mistake!"


---
" But I'm very sorry!"
---
," she said.


---
that I have come to the wrong house, madam
---
A little stimulated at not finding her
 ready and waiting-- so fanciful are men!--he
---
," she said."
---
I think of
---
while I
 watch from here
---
Why should she have answered?


---
as she did
---
" I look as at a picture merely.
---
But," she went on,,".
---
I may do so now
---
-- I may look for you
---
Ah-- I do n't mean it seriously!
---
"

" If so, I do n't know.
---
I came to Casterbridge
 thinking I should like to live here.
---
But I wonder."


---
if I shall
---
Yet I've done very well this year.
---
I bought largely of him in the autumn, and
---
I had!
---
Just when I sold the markets
---
I bought up
 the corn of those who had been holding back at less price than my first
 purchases.
---
" I
 sold it a few weeks after,
---
And so, by
 contenting mysel' with small profits frequently repeated, I soon made
 five hundred pounds-- yes!"--(bringing down his hand upon the table, and
 quite forgetting where he was)--"while the others by keeping theirs in
 hand made nothing at all!"


---
Lucetta regarded him with a critical interest.
---
" Ay, now, I'm wearying you!"
---
She said,".


---
I mean all you Scotchmen
---
"," she added in hasty correction."
---
I think of home sometimes!"
---
Lucetta did not add,,.


---
as she might have done
---
She shook her head.


---
what Lucetta had said,
---
"," she said.


---
The long
 bonnets of the women, like waggon- tilts, their cotton gowns and checked
 shawls, mixed with the carters' smockfrocks; for they, too, entered into
 the hiring.
---
The girl's lips quivered."
---
" she murmured."
---
" O! no, no," she insisted,; and

---
she turned her face to Lucetta's wall.
---
"," she said with strong feelings.
---
if I had my wish
---
O,, I'd let!"


---
" Maybe I can manage
---
she cried,."
---
she saw.
---
"," said Lucetta.
---
, I have

---
I must be a
 little stricter than that
---
" You are a-- a thriving woman; and
---
"," replied she,.
---
I've gone athwart and about
 the fair half- a- dozen times, and never a sign of him:."


---
" I quite forgot the engagement,
---
," said she;"?"


---
"," she urged.
---
" Certainly," she said.
---
" Oh, I do n't know that.
---
" No, I'll not say that.
---
I wish."


---
Lucetta almost laughed but
---
-- she would quite have laughed--
---
that there was
 a little emotion going in her at the time.
---
she said.

---
" I have never wished such things before
---
she said eagerly,.
---
I'm a coquette, which
 some may, because of the incidents of my life, do n't believe it, for I
 am not
---
" I swear!"
---
I will not
---
She had enkindled the young man's enthusiasm;.
---
Lucetta as a young girl would hardly have looked at a tradesman.
---
But her
 ups and downs, had made her
 uncritical as to station.
---
In her poverty she had met with repulse from
 the society to which she had belonged, and
---
she had no great zest for
.
---
Her heart longed for some ark into
.
---
she did not care so
.


---
Lucetta at the window watched.
---
She could see by his gait, and
---
she could see
 him no more.


---
when she had left the window
---
the
 waiting- maid tripped up.


---
But I do n't know-- I do n't know!"

" The Mayor," she said.


---
Lucetta had reclined herself, and
---
she was looking dreamily through
 her fingers.
---
She did not answer at once, and
---
the maid repeated the
 information with the addition," And
---
as I have a headache
---
that I wo n't detain him to- day
---
she heard the door close.


---
Lucetta had come to Casterbridge.
---
She had quickened them, and
---
now she was indifferent to
 the achievement.


---
she no longer felt strongly the necessity of getting rid of the girl for
 her stepfather's sake.
---
When the young woman came in, sweetly unconscious
 of the turn in the tide
---
, Lucetta went up to her, and
---
" I'm so glad you've come.
---
Her emotions rose,.




24.



---
what her malignant star had done to

---
she had won from Donald Farfrae
---
Lucetta's house being a home
---
For in addition to, that raking view of
 the market- place had as much attraction for her as for
 Lucetta.
---
Elizabeth and Lucetta were sitting at breakfast.
---
She called
 Elizabeth from her breakfast, and
---
Elizabeth saw.


---
the gowns spread out on the bed, one of a deep cherry
 colour, the other lighter-- a glove lying at the end of each sleeve, a
 bonnet at the top of each neck, and parasols across the gloves,
 Lucetta standing beside the suggested human figure in an attitude of
 contemplation
---
" I would n't think so hard about it
---
," said Elizabeth,
---
with which Lucetta was alternating the question
---
" so trying," said Lucetta.
---
that she would be the
 cherry- coloured person at all hazards
---
Lucetta walked with it into the front room,.


---
Elizabeth following
 her
---
The sun fell
 so flat on the houses and pavement opposite Lucetta's residence that
 they poured their brightness into her rooms.
---
, women drew near it
---
how it struck
 Lucetta
---
," she said.


---
," said Elizabeth.


---
" I wonder?"


---
Elizabeth left the window,.
---
She hardly knew."


---
that she had done
 this till Lucetta, animated by the conjunction of her new attire with
 the sight of Farfrae
---
because
 she alone rivalled it in colour
---
She
 looked up, and
---
there was her stepfather.


---
Elizabeth- Jane,
 embarrassed out of her equanimity,,
---
" I am
 happy to become acquainted with you, Mr. Henchard," she said.
---
She could
 not believe.
---
that they had been uttered by her stepfather;
---
Yet Lucetta seemed silent, and
---
of she did not know what
---
Lucetta next recognized him, and
---
more
 mistress of herself said archly," The' Lass of Gowrie' from inside of a
 seed- drill-- what a phenomenon!"


---
" she added, on the strength
 of Henchard's information.


---
Lucetta seemed.
---
" she
 asked of Farfrae.


---
than she appertained to
---
Lucetta, discerning, partly in his mercantile mood and partly in his romantic
 one, said gaily to him--


---
that she had been in the way,
---
Lucetta explained the matter somewhat by saying
 when they were again in the sitting- room--

" I had occasion to speak to Mr. Farfrae the other day, and so I knew him
 this morning."


---
Lucetta was very kind towards Elizabeth that day.
---
Lucetta and Elizabeth looked out upon this,
---
"," said Lucetta.

"
---
And having forgotten the momentary mystery of Henchard's seeming
 speech to Lucetta she continued,".
---
I am
 respectable
---
I have tried, but in
 vain!
---
Lucetta seemed to wince.
---
I do not-- of that kind precisely
---
"," she said,
" but
---
" O no," said Lucetta quickly.
---
" I was thinking of--."


---
when women get themselves in strange positions in the eyes of the world
 from no fault of their own
---
for might not other women despise them?
---
Lucetta winced again.
---
Her past was by no means secure from
 investigation, even in Casterbridge.
---
she could have

---
when her eyes met Lucetta's as

---
, she somehow knew.
---
who could
 read her
---
Lucetta passed on and

---
A seer's spirit took possession of Elizabeth,
---
She followed Lucetta somewhere as if by chance--.
---
because this one was
 Lucetta
---
She depicted his impassioned manner;
---
when Lucetta came noiselessly behind her and
---
as she had pictured
---
-- she could have sworn it.
---
Lucetta
 had a heightened luminousness in her eye over and above the advanced
 colour of her cheeks.


---
," said Elizabeth demurely.


---
" Yes," said Lucetta.
---
She knelt down on the hearth and.
---
But after all she did not say.


---
when or how she had seen him or

---
That night she became restless
---
; in the morning she was feverish; and

---
at breakfast- time she told her companion.
---
that she had something on her
 mind-- something which concerned a person in whom she was interested
 much
---
Elizabeth was earnest.


---
," she said
 tentatively.


---
as she
 did of him
---
She agreed.
---
though she had been so far compromised with
 him
---
; that she felt.
---
she could never belong to another man, as a pure
 matter of conscience,
---
even if she should wish to

."


---
her life quite closed up for her
---
" She suffered much on account of him;.
---
though I should add" But in the interval she-- my poor friend-- had seen a man
---
, she liked
 better than him.
---
she liked better
---
" Yes," said Lucetta,.
---
that she was forced
 into an equivocal position with the first man by an accident--
---
that she had
 discovered some qualities in the first that rendered him less desirable
 as a husband than she had at first thought him to be
---
I can not answer
---
Lucetta showed in her appealing tone how
 much she leant on Elizabeth's judgment.


---
" Yes, Miss Templeman," admitted Elizabeth.
---
Nevertheless, Lucetta seemed.
---
relieved by the simple fact of having
 opened out the situation a little, and was slowly convalescent of her
 headache
---
" I would rather not say."

 How do I appear to people?" she
 said languidly.


---
" Well-- a little worn," answered Elizabeth,.


---
she enabled Lucetta
---
which Lucetta anxiously did
---
" I wonder!"
---
if I wear well,
---
she observed after a while.


---
" Where am I worst?"


---
" Under your eyes-- I notice a little brownness there."


---
, I know.
---
I
 shall last
---
before I get hopelessly plain
---
There was something curious in the way in which Elizabeth, though
 the younger, had come to play the part of experienced sage in these
 discussions.
---
"," she said judicially.
---
Lucetta seemed.
---
She told Elizabeth- Jane no more of the past attachment; and
---
she had

---
Elizabeth,
 who in spite of her philosophy was very tender- hearted.
---
that her pretty, rich Lucetta did not treat
 her to the full confidence of names and dates in her confessions
---
For by
 the" she" of Lucetta's story Elizabeth had not been beguiled.

---
that Elizabeth
 sat invisible in the room
---
who could boast of a more
 Protean variety in her phases, moods, opinions, and also principles,

---
than could Elizabeth
---
Lucetta had persisted in dragging her into the
 circle; but
---
she had remained like an awkward third point which that
 circle would not touch.


---
as she had borne up under worse things, and
---
She stoically looked from her bedroom window, and."
---
Yes," she
 said at last,!"


---
that the young woman,
 was, when now qualified with a slight inaccessibility and a more matured
 beauty,
---
But she seemed, and.
---
so transubstantiated
 by her change of position
---
She said something very polite
 about his being good enough to call.
---
" Why, of course I have called, Lucetta
---
"," she said evasively.


---
" Yes, yes; I suppose.
---
But, Lucetta, I felt directly
---
my
 poor ill- used Susan died, and
---
when I could not bear the idea of marrying
 again
---
Still, I
 would n't call in a hurry,."
---
" Upon my life I did n't know such furniture
---
," said she."
---
" O no, I am not."


---
, I am sure,."
---
" I am greatly obliged to you for all that
---
," said she, rather with an air
 of speaking ritual.
---
I say
---
But there, there, I do n't wish
 to quarrel with' ee.
---
I come with an honest proposal for silencing your
 Jersey enemies, and
---
she answered,."
---
that my
 only crime was the indulging in a foolish girl's passion for you with
 too little regard for correctness, and
---
that I was
---
what I call innocent
 all the time they called me guilty
---
I
 suffered enough at that worrying time, when you wrote to tell me of
 your wife's return and my consequent dismissal, and
---
if I am a little
 independent now
---
For the first time in their acquaintance Lucetta had the move; and
---
yet
 she was backward."
---
For the present let," she said with some
 embarrassment."
---
I'll treat you as
 one.
---
She stopped; and
---
Lucetta's face became--.


---
as a woman's face becomes

---
she loves
---
the
 secret of her inaccessibility would have been revealed.
---
her tone was looking down so plumb- straight that he did not
 note the warm consciousness upon Lucetta's face
---
while Lucetta was so anxious to divert him from any suspicion of the
 truth that she asked him to be in no hurry
---
she
 insisted upon paring one for him
---
when she dropped upon the sofa and

---
she cried
 passionately;".
---
But Lucetta reasoned nothing:

---
she feared hard words from the people with whom she had been earlier
 associated
---
; she had; and
---
Elizabeth- Jane, surveying the position of Lucetta between her two lovers
 from the crystalline sphere of a straightforward mind
---
as she called him
---
she experienced from the almost absolute obliviousness to
 her existence that was shown by the pair of them
---
dissipated by her sense of its humourousness
---
When Lucetta had pricked
 her finger
---
they were as deeply concerned as if she were dying
---
when she
 herself had been seriously sick or
---
; she could not help.
---
what she had done to

---
As
 regarded Farfrae, she thought, after honest reflection,.
---
What was she beside Lucetta?-- as one of the" meaner
 beauties of the night,".


---
She had learnt the lesson of renunciation, and.
---
If
 her earthly career had taught her few book philosophies
---
Yet her experience had consisted less in
 a series of pure disappointments than in a series of substitutions.

---
what she had desired
---
that had not been
 granted her, and
---
that what had been granted her
---
she had not desired
---
So
 she viewed with an approach to equanimity the now cancelled days when
 Donald had been her undeclared lover, and.




26.



---
," do you remember my
 story of that second woman-- who suffered for her thoughtless intimacy
 with me
---
she wo n't marry
 me.
---
Now what would you think of her
---
Her windows gleamed as

---
; her curtains seem,.
---
when she offered him tea
---
if she knew Mr. Farfrae
---
O yes, she knew him
---
, she declared
---
; she could not help.


---
" Yes," said Lucetta.


---
Lucetta was full of little fidgets and flutters, which increased
 Henchard's suspicions without affording any special proof of their
 correctness.
---
into which she had placed herself for his sake
---
, the false position;
 such she had been
---
Lucetta, forming the
 third and haloed figure, was opposite them; Elizabeth- Jane,
---
" I should n't wonder
."" More bread- and- butter?" said Lucetta to Henchard and Farfrae equally,
.
---
" Oh-- I am so sorry!"
---
" How ridiculous of all three of them!" said Elizabeth to herself.


---
More than once,
 in spite of her care, Lucetta had been unable to restrain her glance
 from flitting across into Farfrae's eyes like a bird to its nest.
---
" I am again out of a foreman
---
She was so fully convinced that he was not the right man for
 the place that, at the risk of making Henchard angry, she expressed
 her apprehension to him when they met.
---
followed by angry voices outside Lucetta's house, which led her and
 Elizabeth- Jane to run to the windows, and pull up the blinds.


---
Lucetta and Elizabeth- Jane had by this time run down to the street
 corner, whence
---
The women had witnessed what nobody else had seen-- the origin
 of the mishap; and
---
Lucetta spoke.


---
" I saw it all, Mr. Henchard," she cried;" and
---
all the women side with Farfrae
---
that creeps into a maid's heart like
 the giddying worm into a sheep's brain
---
because Lucetta heard this low dialogue, or not her white
 figure
---
Candle- lights were flitting in and out of her bedroom, and
---
it was
 obvious that she was dressing for the appointment, whatever the nature
 of that might be at such an hour.
---
That she had been waiting just inside for him
---
for she instantly opened the door herself.
---
"," Lucetta was saying gaily.
---
After some broken words she added,?"


---
," she presently
 said.
---
" But I should wish."


---
If I wished for instance, upon
 finding that I should not be happy here
---
Lucetta insisted on parting from Farfrae.
---
to wait a few minutes, she was inexorable, and.


---
her dress rustling in the hall
---
In a moment she appeared.


---
as she saw him
---
she uttered a little cry, almost of terror
---
she exclaimed, with a flushed face.
---
" I do n't know.
---
that I've not the right
---
At any rate I have the excuse.
---
" I called an hour ago, and
---
I thought.
---
I have a little matter to
."


---
She sank into a chair, and.


---
" I do n't want--
---
I do n't want!"
---
she said through her
 hands,,
---
She was silent.
---
In feeling
 this she herself forgot for the moment her partially justifying
 argument--
---
, she
 had some excuse for not risking her happiness in his hands after once
 escaping them.
---
she could say
---
" she cried passionately.


---
A look of resignation settled upon her.
---
Without another word she rang the bell, and.
---
The latter appeared, surprised in the
 midst of her lucubrations.
---
as she saw Henchard
---
As soon she went across
 to him dutifully.


---
" Elizabeth- Jane taking her hand I want."
 
---
And turning to Lucetta:" Will you, or
---
No sooner had she given the promise.


---
than she fell back in a fainting
 state
---
" What dreadful thing drives her father,?"."
---
when it is such a
 pain to her
---
kneeling down by Lucetta
---
that she can not bear much
---
At this Lucetta seemed.


---
" she said wildly.


---
as I am concerned
---
" Nobody, as far," said Elizabeth firmly.


---
She agrees."


---
" But do n't dwell on it just now," entreated Elizabeth,.


---
if she promises
---
she said.

---
," Lucetta murmured with closed eyes,
 little thinking, however, so unsuspicious was she,.


---
" I would not-- do anything against you at all!"
---
till she was ready to burst
---
" I can not
 understand
---
; I do n't sympathize with him
 in it at all.
---
I'll go to him and."


---
" No, no," said Lucetta."
---
nothing of her was.


---
She was an
 old woman of mottled countenance, attired in a shawl of that nameless
 tertiary hue which comes, but can not be made-- a hue neither tawny,
 russet, hazel, nor ash; a sticky black bonnet that seemed to have been
 worn in the country of the Psalmist where the clouds drop fatness; and
 an apron that had been white in time so comparatively recent as still to
 contrast visibly with the rest of her clothes.
---
The steeped aspect of the
 woman as a whole showed.


---
her to be no native of the country- side or even
 of a country- town
---
She looked cursorily at Henchard and the second magistrate, and
---
as if she had reminded him
 indistinctly of somebody or something which passed from his mind as

---
Well, and what has she been doing?
---
" She is charged, sir, with the offence of disorderly female and
 nuisance,
---
" Where did she do that?"
---
Stubberd, with a suppressed gaze of victorious rectitude at the old
 woman, continued:".
---
She was wambling about quite
 dangerous to the thoroughfare and."


---
Yes, what did she say?
---
" I object to that where I,' is not sound testimony when I approached" She said,'."


---
she says
---
" Yes."

" Says she,'?
---
I
 have floored fellows,
---
if I haint
---
a dee sight finer- looking than a dee fool like
 thee' she says.


---
" I object to that conversation!"
---
" I was not
 capable enough to hear what I said, and
---
that the
 old woman had appeared in court so many more times than the magistrates
 themselves,
---
" Yes," she replied with a twinkle in her eye; and
---
" Twenty years ago or thereabout I was selling of furmity in a tent at
 Weydon Fair----"

"'
---
" the woman
 continued.
---
that the old
 furmity dealer had mysteriously hinted to the denizens of the lane in
 which she had been lodging since her arrival,
---
that she knew a queer
 thing or two about their great local man Mr. Henchard,
---
if she chose to

---
said Lucetta
 to her servant when the case was over.
---
She had risen late, and.


---
A woman has
 proved that before he became a gentleman he sold his wife for five
 guineas in a booth at a fair."


---
she now heard for the first time
---
as she dwelt upon the promise
 wrung from her the night before
---
During the day she went out to the Ring and to other places,.
---
as she saw Elizabeth- Jane after her return
 indoors
---
As soon she told her
---
that she had resolved
---
that she looked wan and disturbed
---
Elizabeth, seeing, encouraged her in
 the idea,.
---
a change would afford her relief
---
She could not help
 suspecting that the gloom which seemed to have come over Casterbridge
 in Lucetta's eyes might be partially owing to the fact that Farfrae was
 away from home.


---
Elizabeth saw her friend depart for Port- Bredy, and.
---
" Is she come now?
---
She returned this morning
---
But she
 is not indoors.
---
She has gone for a walk along the turnpike- road to
 Port- Bredy.
---
She will be home by dusk."


---
At this hour Lucetta was bounding along the road to Port- Bredy.
---
just as
 Elizabeth had announced
---
That she had chosen for her afternoon
---
walk the
 road along which she had returned to Casterbridge three hours earlier
 in a carriage.
---
Lucetta, in continuing her walk, had at length reached the end of the
 ranked trees which bordered the highway in this and other directions out
 of the town.
---
here she stopped.


---
Near
 her was a barn-- the single building of any kind within her horizon.


---
She strained her eyes up the lessening road, but
---
She sighed one word--"Donald!"
---
Elizabeth- Jane's.

 Lucetta, in spite of her loneliness, seemed a little vexed.
---
as she recognized her friend
---
Elizabeth's
 face, as soon, shaped itself into
 affectionate lines while yet beyond speaking distance.
---
" I suddenly
 thought I would come and meet you," she said,.


---
Lucetta's reply was taken from her lips by an unexpected diversion.
---
A
 by- road on her right hand descended from the fields into the highway
 at the point where she stood, and down the track.


---
a bull was rambling
 uncertainly towards her and Elizabeth,
---
The head of stock
 driven into and out of the town at this season was very large; and all these horned beasts, in travelling to
 and fro, sent women and children to shelter as nothing else could do.

---
Lucetta and Elizabeth regarded the animal in doubt
---
that the young women
 were
---
the two helpless girls to run
 wildly
---
"," she said.


---
The girls doubled so adroitly that their pursuer was
 against the wall when the fugitives were already half way to the other
 end.
---
Lucetta was hysterical, and
---
she cried, as soon as she could speak.


---
" I have returned your kindness
---
she asked,.


---
" I came out here.
---
I have been wanting; but
---
I could
 not.
---
Where is Elizabeth?"


---
" Here am I!
---
she slid down the face of the clover- stack to
 the floor
---
Henchard supporting Lucetta on one side, and Elizabeth- Jane on the
 other, they went slowly along the rising road.
---
that she had dropped her muff in the barn
---
I'll run back
---
She thereupon hastened down again to the barn,
.


---
Elizabeth soon found the muff, such an article being by no means small
 at that time.
---
Coming out she paused,
.
---
At length she turned the vehicle being driven by Farfrae.


---
when she saw a green- and- black gig approaching from the
 contrary direction
---
how greatly Lucetta had been jeopardized
---
" She has gone on with Mr. Henchard
---
" And you are sure she can get home?"


---
" Your stepfather saved her?"

" Entirely."


---
; she guessed why.
---
she felt more
 embarrassed at sitting thus beside her past lover; but
---
The face
 of the woman was frequently turned back, but
---
," said she.
---
though she would fain
---
said Lucetta.
---
I am
 full of gratitude to you
---
I am a monied person now.
---
Surely I can do
 something in return for your goodness-- something practical?"


---
" Then of?" she asked with renewed misgiving.


---
" I must tell you a secret.--
---
that I have
 been unlucky this year
---
I did; and
---
what I have never done before--
---
I lost.
---
even though she may be so nearly my own as you
---
"," she began, and
---
the dryness of her lips was
 represented in her voice.


---
," she said,
 with rising distress.


---
" I can not!"
---
she insisted desperately.


---
When I have
---
If I must tell you----
---
I am already his wife.
---
She was so alarmed at his silence that
 she murmured something about lending him sufficient money to tide over
 the perilous fortnight.


---
It was like this with tears in her eyes and quavers
 in her voice
---
," she explained,
---
O you false woman!" burst from Henchard.

---
She disappeared under the trees of the south walk.
---
Lucetta took no heed, but.




30.



---
it had been much hindered on account of the frequent
 pauses necessitated by exclamations of surprise at the event, of which
 the good woman had been briefly informed by letter a few hours earlier.


---
Moreover, there was a
 convenience in Lucetta arriving first at her house.
---
she was best in a position to break the news
 to the inmates, and.
---
By a strenuous effort, after leaving Henchard she calmed herself in
 readiness to receive Donald at High- Place Hall.
---
One supreme fact empowered her to this, the sense that, come
 what would
---
, she had secured him.
---
she met him with a relieved gladness, which a month's
 perilous absence could not have intensified.


---
," she said
 earnestly,.
---
she had finished
---
she might have heard of it in the town, and
---
" She can hardly have heard of it.
---
her living on with me just the same as
 before
---
She is so quiet and unassuming."


---
if she would care to
---
" O yes!" said Lucetta eagerly.
---
" I am sure she would like to.
---
Besides,
 poor thing, she has no other home."


---
that she did not suspect the secret of
 her more reserved friend
---
as you like with her by all means
---
speak to her," said Lucetta.


---
When she got upstairs to Elizabeth- Jane's room
---
the latter had taken off
 her out- door things, and.
---
Lucetta found in a
 moment.


---
that she had not yet learnt the news
---
" I did not come down to you, Miss Templeman
---
," she said simply.
---
" I was
 coming, but
---
I found
.
---
, I wonder?
---
Lucetta uttered a vague" Yes," and.
---
," she
 presently said;"
---
You should get out, and
 gossip about as other women do, and
---
Well, now, I have something to tell you."


---
she was so glad,
---
" I must go rather a long way back," said Lucetta, the difficulty of
 explaining herself satisfactorily to the pondering one beside her
 growing more apparent at each syllable.
---
" You remember that trying case
 of conscience I told you of some time ago-- about the first lover and the
 second lover?" She let out in jerky phrases a leading word or two of the
 story she had told.


---
" O yes-- I remember the story of YOUR FRIEND
---
," said Elizabeth drily,
.
---
she wanted, but
---
she ought
---
; so that she neglected
 the better course to follow the evil, like the poet Ovid
---
I've just been
 construing:' Video meliora proboque, deteriora sequor.'
---
; she did n't follow evil exactly!
---
" said Lucetta hastily.


---
you"-- answered Elizabeth,

---
that she-- or dropping the mask
---
Lucetta's blush at being seen through came and
---
she replied anxiously," will you,
 Elizabeth- Jane?"


---
" Then I will tell you
---
I and the first man were thrown
 together in a strange way, and.
---
But the wife returned, and

---
She is now dead, and
---
I was absolved from
 all vows by the return of the other woman."


---
She had divined Man Number One.


---
she ought
---
if
 she can
---
But I think, even if she were not the sinning party."

 Lucetta's countenance lost its sparkle."
---
to be a man I
 should be afraid to marry," she pleaded."
---
You must remain a single
 woman."

" But
---
Her craving for correctness of procedure was, indeed, almost
 vicious.
---
Owing to her early troubles with regard to her mother a
 semblance of irregularity had terrors for her which those whose names
 are safeguarded from suspicion know nothing of.
---
she went on with a
 quivering lip in whose movement two passions shared.


---
said Lucetta passionately.


---
Lucetta covered her eyes with her right hand,.


---
as if she could plead no
 more,
---
, I am sure, with your beauty and wealth and
 accomplishments.
---
You are the woman he will adore, and
---
cried Lucetta distressfully."
---
that I have married
---
I was so desperate-- so afraid of being forced to
 anything else-- so afraid of revelations that would quench his love for
 me, that I resolved to do it offhand,!"


---
Lucetta bowed.
---
She had recovered herself.


---
," she said.
---
I have told him."


---
that I want
---
" Let," the girl quickly replied,.


---
I am sure we shall be happy together."


---
Lucetta departed.
---
Not on account of her friend
 Elizabeth did she feel it: for of the bearings of Elizabeth- Jane's
 emotions she had not the least suspicion; but on Henchard's alone.


---
when she hastily put on her things
---
In a few minutes, knowing the ground, she had found a suitable
 lodging, and.
---
Returning and entering
 noiselessly she took off her pretty dress and
---
arrayed herself in a plain
 one, packing up the other to keep as her best; for she would have.
---
She wrote a note.
---
she trotted off down the street to her rooms
---
Here she sat down and.
---
The little
 annual sum settled on her by her stepfather
---
A wonderful skill in netting of all sorts---- might serve her in good
 stead; and
---
her studies,, might serve
 her in still better.


---
when she saw
---
A bystander
 informed her, with some surprise at her ignorance,.
---
She felt quite
 tearful, and.


---
when she heard, but
---
when Farmer James Everdene of Weatherbury
 spoke
---
as she might
---
Try, Elizabeth could never meet with him.
---
She believed
 in him still,; and
---
she wanted.


---
She wrote to him
---
She then went to his house-- the
 great house she had lived in so happily for a time-- with its front
 of dun brick, vitrified here and there and its heavy sash- bars-- but

---
that
 she was not his daughter
---
Thither she went.


---
Elizabeth thought it odd that he had fixed on this spot to retire to,
 but.
---
But even here her stepfather could not be seen.


---
" Not by his daughter?" pleaded Elizabeth.


---
," she was informed.


---
Afterwards she was passing by the corn- stores and hay- barns which had
 been the headquarters of his business.
---
She knew; but
---
that she regarded the familiar
 gateway
---
she said,
"?"


---
Meanwhile Elizabeth- Jane, in an upper room no larger than the Prophet's
 chamber, and with the silk attire of her palmy days packed away in a
 box
---
which she devoted

---
as she could get hold of
---
Her lodgings being nearly opposite her stepfather's former residence,

---
now Farfrae's, she could see Donald and Lucetta speeding in and out
 of their door with all the bounding enthusiasm of their situation.
---
She
 avoided, but
---
While living on thus quietly she heard the news that Henchard had caught
 cold and possibly a result of standing about
 the meads in damp weather.
---
She went off to his house at once.
---
she was
---
she remained.
---
She made the room more
 comfortable,
---
she
 went away
---
The effect, either of her ministrations or of her mere presence, was a
 rapid recovery.
---
" Yes, she was wise
---
, she was wise in her generation!"
---
It was no mercenary
 hankering after her fortune.

---
Elizabeth- Jane sat at her window one Sunday, and.
---
while there she heard
 in the street below a conversation which introduced Henchard's name
---
She
 was wondering, when a third person who was passing
 by asked the question in her mind.


---
, Lucetta and Farfrae passed again, this time homeward,
.
---
where her
 stepfather was
---
She took
 his arm, and
---
" she asked cautiously,.


---
May I come in?
---
" she said.


---
she went away;.


---
as it was certainly her strong
 desire
---
She seemed; and
---
she remained indoors
,
---
her face being visible to
 Elizabeth- Jane from her window aloft
---
The latter, however, did not say
 to herself, but,
"


---
full of her reading, she cited Rosalind's exclamation:" Mistress, know
 yourself; down on your knees and.
---
She kept her eye upon Henchard also.
---
,"
  said she.
---
Her motive on going to the yard was.
---
that
 her stepfather was a workman there
---
that she wished when the two were face to
 face
---
For two or three days after her arrival Donald did not make any
 appearance.
---
Meanwhile Lucetta, never having been informed.
---
where she came suddenly upon Henchard, and
---
the rest had done, to which she breathed a dead- alive
" Good afternoon."


---
" I beg your pardon, ma'am?
---
" I said good afternoon," she faltered.


---
" Lucetta looked embarrassed, and
---
She glanced at him entreatingly
---
" Yes," she said hastily;" half- past four."


---
as she could do so
---
As soon Lucetta left him,.
---
where she could be seen
---
That she had been taken by
 surprise
---
" Will you," said Lucetta, with as much bitterness as she could put into
 a small communication,
---
if I walk through the yard at
 any time
---
I bear you no ill- will, and
---
I am only too glad that you should
 have employment of my dear husband; but
---
I have

---
Lucetta took care.
---
She would
 rather have died.
---
she found, and
---
her stepfather was measuring up
 clover- seed and rape- seed in the corn- stores on the top floor
---
she
 ascended to him.
---
When Elizabeth's head rose through the trap she perceived that the upper
 door was open, and that her stepfather and Farfrae stood just within it
 in conversation, Farfrae being nearest the dizzy edge, and Henchard
 a little way behind.
---
Not to interrupt them she remained on the steps
 without raising her head any higher.
---
While waiting thus she saw-- or
.
---
she saw
---
for she had a terror of feeling certain-- her stepfather
 a curious
 expression taking possession of his face
---
Elizabeth felt quite sick at heart on thinking of what this MIGHT have
 meant.
---
As soon she mechanically took the tea to Henchard,
.
---
Reflecting, she endeavoured.
---
she
 finally resolved.




34.



---
Next morning, accordingly, she rose at five o'clock and.
---
She moved on to the bottom of Corn Street, and,.
---
before she heard the familiar
 bang of his door
---
She met him at
 the point where the last tree of the engirding avenue flanked the last
 house in the street.


---
She asked him.

---
" But I am anxious to mention something
---
," she said.
---
" And I wished not to
 alarm Mrs. Farfrae by calling."


---
She now felt the difficulty of conveying to his mind the exact aspect
 of possibilities in her own.
---
But she somehow began, and."
---
" she said with an effort,".


---
And she could see.
---
she went homeward,
---
Elizabeth entered her
,.


---
she had done no good,
---
appear foolish by her weak note of warning
---
Lucetta, light as a sylph, ran
 forward and
---
as I've a day's work to offer he shall do it if
 he chooses But I'll
 drop the idea of establishing him in a shop till I can think more about
 it."

" Oh!" she cried playfully,."
---
, she noticed.
---
Without directly inquiring why
 she let.


---
" No," said Lucetta.
---
Lucetta had grown somewhat wan."
---
No," she replied.


---
" I give him employment--
---
I cannet
---
But neither can I blind
 myself to the fact that with a man of passions such as his, there is no
 safeguard for conduct!"


---
"?" said Lucetta in alarm.
---
The
 words on her lips were" anything about me?"--
---
but she did not utter them.

---
She could not, however, suppress her agitation, and
---
her eyes filled with
 tears.


---
I wish
---
", I suppose of poor Doctor Chalkfield's death?
---
From this evening onward Lucetta was very uneasy.
---
If she had not been

---
she would not have acted
---
as she did
---
when she met
 Henchard by accident a day or two later
---
She explained."
---
how the death of her aunt had prevented
---
her taking the
 journey on that day
---
" she asked.


---
When she was gone
---
I-- and the
 fair Lucetta was....
---
i' the
 bud-- Henchard; what he could tell!


---
" I was going
---
That ever I should see'em again! I
 hope?"

" She has felt a bit weary; and."


---
What became of the poor woman
---
" Luckily she married, and
---
she poured out on me
---
what an angry woman will
 say
---
who is yet no more to you than the
 first woman you meet in the street--
---
That in the event of your present wife's death you will place me
 in her position
---
how she went on to me
---
it is the way wi' women
---
she assumed
---
But why did n't you marry her?"
---
when your
 wife Susan died
---
" In spite of all her
 protestations, to do so, as in generosity bound, she
 was not the woman for me."


---
" She had already married another-- maybe?"


---
She had
---
, she had
---
, Lucetta had retired early to her room because of
 fatigue.
---
She had,.
---
At the ringing of
 the door- bell by Henchard she wondered.
---
The dining- room was almost under her
 bed- room
---
; she could hear, and
---
She could
 think of nothing.
---
At last she left
 the room, and.
---
The dining- room door was ajar, and
 in the silence of the resting household the voice and the words were
 recognizable before she reached the lower flight.
---
She stood.

---
as if she would make a friend of it in her misery
---
Rigid in
 this position, more and more words fell successively upon her ear.
---
what amazed her most
---
Is it quite fair to this
 young woman's memory?"


---
Lucetta heard no more.


---
She went back to her bedroom in a semi- paralyzed state.
---
For very fear
 she could not undress, but.
---
Her suspense was
 terrible.
---
Had she confessed all to Donald in their early acquaintance; but
---
; she could hear.
---
The spark in
 her eyes well- nigh went out.
---
Her
 gaze hung doubtful for a moment, then to her joyous amazement she saw
.
---
She could hold out no longer, and

---
Finding this, she was much perplexed as to Henchard's motives in opening
 the matter at all
---
Next morning Lucetta remained in bed,.
---
for she dreaded lest in doing so he, like
 the rest of the world
---
that the episode was rather her
 fault than her misfortune
---
She decided.
---
It seemed the only practicable weapon
 left her as a woman.
---
Having laid her plan she rose, and.
---
who
 kept her on these tenterhooks:--

"
---
To herself she said, on closing up her appeal:"!"


---
With this view she made a toilette which differed from all she had ever
 attempted before.
---
To heighten her natural attraction had hitherto been
.
---
in which she was no
 novice
---
But now she neglected this, and.
---
Beyond a natural reason for her slightly drawn
 look, she had not slept all the previous night, and
---
this had produced
 upon her pretty though slightly worn.
---
She selected-- as
 much from want of spirit as design-- her poorest, plainest and longest
.


---
To avoid the contingency of being recognized she veiled herself, and

---
The sun was resting on the hill like a
 drop of blood on an eyelid by the time she had got up the road opposite
 the amphitheatre, which she speedily entered.
---
She was not disappointed in the fearful hope with which she awaited him.

---
she saw a change in his bearing
---
; she could not think why.


---
that in appointing this
 spot, and this hour, for the rendezvous, Lucetta had unwittingly backed
 up her entreaty by the strongest argument she could have used outside
 words, with this man of moods, glooms, and superstitions
---
before she had spoken a word
---
, her point was

---
Of course I'm glad to come if you want me."


---
" O, thank you," she said apprehensively.


---
" I am sorry to see'
---
She shook her head."
---
," she asked,"?"


---
," she said.
---
" I have no other grief.
---
When I came here

---
I was a young woman
---
; now I am rapidly becoming an old one.
---
which had led to all her trouble
---
Moreover that thoughtless want of foresight
 remained with poor Lucetta still
---
; she
 had come.
---
Such a woman was very small deer to hunt
---
" Ah!" she said with eager tremulousness;" but!"


---
not till I have proved
 myself a faithful and deserving wife to him, and
---
-- I hope so
---
Returning from her appointment Lucetta saw a man waiting by the lamp
 nearest to her own door.
---
When she stopped
---
if Lucetta would say a word in his favour to her
 husband
---
"," said Lucetta coldly.


---
" knew you there by sight," she replied.
---
" But I knew nothing of you."


---
" I think, ma'am,.


---
She steadily refused.


---
till she had vanished
---
I wish
---
animated by resentment at Lucetta's haughtiness
---
Another was the frequency of white aprons over dingy gowns among the
 women around the doorways.
---
A white apron is a suspicious vesture in
 situations where spotlessness is difficult; moreover, the industry and
 cleanliness which the white apron expressed were belied by the postures
 and gaits of the women who wore it-- their knuckles being mostly on their
 hips( an attitude which lent them the aspect of two- handled mugs), and
 their shoulders against door- posts; while there was a curious alacrity
 in the turn of each honest woman's head upon her neck and in the twirl
 of her honest eyes, at any noise resembling a masculine footfall along
 the lane.


---
The landlady
 was a virtuous woman who years ago had been unjustly sent to gaol as
 an accessory to something or other after the fact.
---
She underwent her
 twelvemonth, and.


---
who apprehended her,
---
when she winked her
 eye
---
Your wife swore false that time,."


---
Joe-- O, by Gad, she
 did no denying it

she could n't see.

---

She then began.'

I was
 And then she sware, Joe;'
---
that the cock pheasant
 was one of her rearing,
---
the furmity- woman,, sat among
 the rest
---
Having travelled a great deal in her time she spoke with
 cosmopolitan largeness of idea.
---
It was she.


---
that a woman should love one man so well, and
---
Lucetta had so earnestly hoped,
---
"' Tis a humbling thing
 for us, as respectable women, that one of the same sex could do it.
---
And
 now she's avowed herself to another man!"


---
" So much the better for her," said the aged furmity- woman."
---
Ah, I saved
 her from a real bad marriage, and
---
she's never been the one to thank me."


---
" I say, what a good foundation for a skimmity- ride
---
receiving a lantern
 from her went out at the back door and down the garden- path, which ended
 abruptly at the edge of the stream already mentioned.
---
when a
 man's wife is-- well, not too particularly his own
---
she simpered.
---
Within an hour its contents were reduced to ashes by Lucetta,
 who, poor soul!.
---
, that episode, if known, was not the less likely to
 operate fatally between herself and her husband.

---
" Carry out what?" said she,.


---
I am going
---
She was perplexed."
---
" she said.


---
I have other fish to fry.
---
She could do nothing to elucidate this, and.
---
she got sight again of her
 stepfather.
---
She thought; but
---
She waited in the crowd without.


---
the
 front seat was occupied by Lucetta, the Mayor's wife, just at present.

---
She appeared so bright and
.
---
as gaily dressed women's
 eyes will too often do on such occasions
---
Her manner signified quite
 plainly.


---
that she meant
---
But she was never tired of watching Donald,,.
---
She was living his part rather than her own, and

---
and Lucetta was
 ready to faint.
---
then her interest in the
 spectacle as a strange phenomenon got the better of her fear.


---
said Mrs. Blowbody, a lady of
 the neighbourhood who sat beside Lucetta.


---
observed Mrs.
 Bath, the physician's wife, a new- comer to the town through her recent
 marriage with the doctor.


---
," said Lucetta.

"
---
a lady of her quality to go snacks wi'
 en in such quick time
---
Now there's a
 better- looking woman than she,."


---
because she's
 akin to that hontish fellow Henchard
---
" I could worship ye, Buzz, for saying that," remarked Nance Mockridge.
" I do I am
 quite unequal to the part of villain myself, or I'd gi'e all my small
 silver.... And perhaps I shall soon," she added
 significantly.


---
what she meant
---
diffused by the reading of Lucetta's letters at Peter's Finger
---
since she came here
---
if there was anything wrong about
 her afore
---
The proceedings had been brief-- too brief-- to Lucetta; but
---
The shake of the Royal hand still lingered
 in her fingers; and
---
the chit- chat she had overheard,
---
as her Scotchman was
---
She has supplicated to me in her time;
 and
---
now her tongue wo n't own me nor
---
her eyes see me!
---
she shall be
 sorry.
---
your fine wife no longer lift' ee above me
---
For poor Lucetta they took no protective measure,
---
believing with the
 majority there was some truth in the scandal, which she would have to
 bear as she best might.


---
Lucetta was sitting in the drawing- room
 alone.
---
she had not had
,.
---
for she preferred, and
---
She was leaning back in the chair, in a more hopeful
 mood than she had enjoyed since her marriage.
---
she really seemed.


---
It did not
 greatly surprise her,.

---
But her attention was at once riveted to the matter by the voice of a
 maid- servant next door, who spoke from an upper window across the street
 to some other maid even more elevated than she.


---
She's facing the head, and
---
There-- now I have got'em
" What's the woman like?
---
just as SHE dressed
---
when she sat in the front
 seat at the time the play- actors came to the Town Hall
---
Lucetta started to her feet, and
---
" I have come to see you," she said breathlessly.
---
I did not stop to
 knock
---
I see, and
---
Without waiting for Lucetta's reply she crossed quickly to the window
 and.
---
Lucetta glided to her side."
---
she said peremporily, in a dry voice,
---
while she seized

---
Their intercourse
 had been so low and hurried that not a word had been lost of the
 conversation without, which had thus proceeded:--

" Her neck is uncovered, and her hair in bands, and her back- comb in
 place
---
; she's got on a puce silk, and white stockings, and coloured
 shoes."


---
Lucetta held her
 by main force.


---
she said, with a face pale as death."
---
The look of Elizabeth betrayed.


---
that the rigid
 wildness of Lucetta's features was growing yet more rigid and wild with
 the meaning of the noise and laughter
---
" she shrieked."
---
" to stop it"
  she cried.
---
She relinquished Lucetta's hands, and.
---
" I will see it!
---
Lucetta herself,
 saying recklessly" turned to the window,.
---
Elizabeth immediately followed, and

---
Lucetta's eyes were straight upon
 the spectacle of the uncanny revel,.
---
" implored Elizabeth;" and
---
She's me
---
"-- she's me-- even to the parasol-- my green parasol!"
---
as she stepped in
---
She stood motionless for
 one second--.


---
Almost at the instant of her fall the rude music of the skimmington
 ceased.
---
Elizabeth was only
 indirectly conscious of this
---
; she had rung the bell, and.
---
She rang again and again, in vain; the probability
 being that the servants had all run out of the house to see more of the
 Daemonic Sabbath than they could see within.


---
The shutters, hastily pushed to by Elizabeth
---
Lucetta carried to her room, and the man
 sent off for a doctor
---
While Elizabeth was undressing her
---
she recovered
 consciousness; but
---
as she remembered
---
," Elizabeth said.


---
But a fit in the present state of her health means mischief.
---
"," said the parlour- maid;" to some
 place on the Budmouth Road.
---
Here, I'll come with you.
---
" Ah," she said apologetically,".
---
so I put
 it there."


---
Though Lucetta's life seemed at that moment
---
to depend upon
 her husband's return( she being in great mental agony,
.
---
It is-- your wife!
---
She is ill.
---
She is in danger.
---
his wife was
 with child
---
" How is she?
---
they have killed her
---
as if she
 struck him in a new light, then, without further remark
---
But about Elizabeth- Jane; in the midst of his gloom she seemed
 to him as a pin- point of light.
---
as she
 answered him from the stairs
---
She was not his own, yet,.


---
Lucetta had been

---
when, immediately after his entry, she had tried the
 secret which so oppressed her
---
while those immediately around Lucetta
 would not venture
---
What, and how much, Farfrae's wife ultimately explained to him of her
 past entanglement with Henchard,.
---
That she informed him of the bare
 facts of her peculiar intimacy with the corn- merchant
---
when she discovered reasons for
 fearing him
---
when she was
 in a measure committed to the first
---
: to what extent she spoke of these
 things
---
a servant raise her hand to the knocker,
.
---
She turned in some surprise at his presence, and.
---
Recognizing him, she said,"."





---
; she will never hear it any more
---
She came into his room,.


---
" she asked."
---
She is-- dead!
---
I know it
---
-- she did, and

---
She could hear; but
---
her mind ran most strongly on Lucetta, whose death
 in such fulness of life and amid such cheerful hopes of maternity was
 appallingly unexpected.
---
Presently she fell asleep.


---
Meanwhile her stepfather in the outer room had set the breakfast in
 readiness; but
---
that she dozed
---
lit by her filial presence
---
" She was a warm- hearted, home- spun woman.
---
She was not
---
-- better she had been."


---
" She was not."


---
", she was simple- minded enough to think
 that the sale was in a way binding.
---
She was as guiltless o."


---
If she had seen it as
.
---
she would never have left me
---
how should she be

---
What advantages had she?
---
She could write her own
 name, and no more."


---
" Well, it was not in my heart to undeceive her when the deed was done
---
that she would be happier with me
---
She was fairly
 happy, and
---
; she had another, and.
---
after she and I and the child returned from America
---
when somebody she
 had confided her history to
---
After that she was never happy
 with me.
---
She pined and.
---
She said.
---
she must
 leave me, and
---
I did it,.
---
for I thought
---
I left her
 at Falmouth, and.
---
When I got to the other side of
 the Atlantic
---
I got ashore at
 Newfoundland, and
---
" I thought, and I never would have undeceived her till the day of her
 death. then I asked myself what I should do.

"' Since I'm here, here I'll bide,' I thought to myself;'' twill be most
 kindness to her.'
---
, now she's taken against me,;
 but
---
her believe
---
me lost,
 for,' I thought,' while she supposes us both alive she'll be miserable
---
if she thinks me dead
---
she'll go back to him, and
---
that,, she went to you, and my daughter with
 her
---
that Susan was dead
---
where is she?
---
" Where is she buried?
---
" When did she die?"


---
so that the sudden prospect of
 her loss had caused.
---
who had been constantly in her presence
---
that she would have vanished
---
there she was--
---
she said.
---
" I had no sooner lain down,
.
---
than I napped
---
though I did not mean to
---
I wonder; but
---
I did not dream about poor Mrs.
 Farfrae, after thinking of her so
---
I did not.
---
" I am glad you have been able to sleep
---
Elizabeth- Jane's thoughts reverted to
 Lucetta.
---
," she said, as soon as she recalled herself to the outspread
 meal,
---
I idly asleep the while."


---
I do it every day
---
what
 Elizabeth would think of him for his deception.


---
Then she arose, and
---
" At this moment her heart is as warm towards me as mine is towards her,

---
she would live with me here in this humble cottage for the asking!
---
then she will scorn
 me!"


---
Susan,
 Farfrae, Lucetta, Elizabeth-- all had gone from him, one after one,
 either by his fault or by his misfortune.


---
She came forward,.
---
," she said,"
---
so I have come
 again
---
Not that I am anything but sad myself.
---
I know."


---
How this woman divined things!
---
Yet she had not divined their whole
 extremity.


---
"

," she said.


---
I will show' ee."


---
what I mean
---
She agreed willingly, and
---
She
 would gladly have talked of Lucetta, but.
---
what she saw
---
She went, and.
---
" Nothing," she said.


---
She proceeded to the river brink a second time.
---
On her return, after
 some delay, she told him; but
---
that she saw something floating round and round
 there
---
she could not discern
---
She went back, and
---
till her head was close to the
 margin of the pool
---
She started up, and.


---
" But tell me-- do-- what is?"

" The effigy," she answered hastily.
---
That performance of theirs killed her, but!"


---
she cried.

---
" May I live with you, and?
---
as I used
---
I do not mind
.
---
I would have agreed, but
---
" I will," said she.

 You can not!"


---
Thus she assured him, and
---
to be;
 the effigy was discovered by a cowherd, and that of Lucetta a little
 higher up in the same stream.
---
Lucetta had been borne along the churchyard
 path
---
; Casterbridge had for the last time,
 before proceeding to its work as if she had never lived.
---
But Elizabeth
 remained undisturbed in the belief of her relationship to Henchard, and

---
Lucetta had confessed everything to him before her
 death, and
---
that she
 was still a creature of the present
---
After that revelation of her
 history,, it
 was hard.


---
that life with her would have been productive of
 further happiness
---
her weaknesses provoking only the gentlest criticism,
 and her sufferings attenuating wrath at her concealments to a momentary
 spark now and then.


---
She took
 long walks into the country two or three times a week, mostly in the
 direction of Budmouth.
---
when she sat
 with him in the evening after those invigorating walks
---
that she was civil
 rather than affectionate
---
She had her own way in everything now.
---
In going and coming, in buying
 and selling, her word was law.


---
," she said.


---
it seemed an unusually good one for her to possess
---
, I suppose, my dear
---
," she said quietly.
---
" O no," said the netted lion, anxious not to pique her in the least.


---
She, on her part, was quite
 unconscious of his attention, and
---
that the Scotchman had once shown a tender interest
 in her, of a fleeting kind
---
that she replied" No."


---
that I saw him in the
 street
---
She did not enlighten him, and lest

---
her to shape thoughts unfavourable to their present
 friendly relations
---
her going and
---
it may at once be owned on her account
.
---
that she was guilty of occasional conversations with Donald
---
SHE( reddening).--"I do n't know that.
---
Elizabeth admitted, but
---
that she did
---
she refrained from confessing why
 the sea attracted her.
---
that, in addition to early marine
 associations, her blood was a sailor's
---
she added shyly."
---
to be bereft of her, so it must be.
---
And so Elizabeth
 would grow, and
---
Elizabeth to be his actual
 daughter, from his own assertion
---
Thus would
 the girl,, be withdrawn from him by degrees
 through her husband's influence, and.


---
Had she lost her heart to any other man in the world than the one he had
 rivalled, cursed, wrestled with for life in days before his spirit was
 broken
---
then she would be her
 step- sire's own again.


---
the simple perambulating term being used hereabout; and the nineteen superior young ladies of Casterbridge, who
 had each looked upon herself as the only woman capable of making the
 merchant Councilman happy, indignantly left off going to the church

---
whose first wife was no credit to him
---
what is
 it for a young perusing woman that's her own mistress and well liked?

---
; she's a sensible piece for
 a partner, and."


---
there's no faithful woman in high life now';--well
---
if she's tender- inclined
---
she
 occupied
---
Elizabeth, as has been said, often took her walks on the Budmouth Road,
 and
---
her to neglect her customary walk that day
---
she had chosen another road for variety's sake.
---
She might be here, and
---
Elizabeth's strict nature would cause
 her for the first time to despise her stepfather,
---
she said innocently.
---
" I have had a letter-- a strange
 one-- not signed.
---
she cried," and?"


---
She looked down and
---
her tears fell silently.
---
It seemed to her.
---
She showed her devotion to Farfrae, however, by mastering her
 emotion and speaking out.


---
," she said with difficult firmness.

---
" For I thought it probable-- possible--, and
---
that I might marry Mr. Farfrae
 some little time hence
---
I did not know!"


---
" I approve of anything you desire to do, Izzy
---
that her affection could urge
---
to reconsider his
 determination; for she could not urge--.
---
what she did not know
---
when
 she should learn
---
that she would refrain from despising him, and
---
when she knew
---
she would refrain from hating him
---
that she would not so refrain
---
that I go" Then," she said at last,."


---
" I do n't want--
---
I do n't want!"
---
when you are living as the wife of the richest
---
that though I loved' ee late I loved' ee
 well
---
she sobbed.


---
" I do n't forbid you
---
She promised mechanically, in her agitation; and
---
She watched his form diminish across the
 moor,
---
till she could no longer see them
---
Though she did not know it Henchard
 formed at this moment much the same picture as he had presented when
 entering Casterbridge for the first time nearly a quarter of a century
 before; except, to be sure,.


---
Elizabeth, in the meantime, had breathed him a sigh,.
---
Before she had reached
 the first house she was met in her walk by Donald Farfrae.
---
She walked beside her lover, and
---
Elizabeth entered.
---
whom she had been separated half- a- dozen years, as if by death
---
Moreover, she had grown up under Newson's paternal care; and.


---
what she had grown up
---
But what do the young woman say herself
 about it?
---
Elizabeth, my child, come and.'


---
, that's not a drinking woman,
---
Elizabeth lived here
---
Elizabeth now gave earnest heed to his story.


---
And, if you'll believe me, I was that upset, that
 I went back to the coach that had brought me, and. I give the man credit for't!"

" she
 cried."
---
Elizabeth sighed.
---
that I should be such a simpleton" No," said Elizabeth- Jane firmly, in her revulsion of feeling."
---
my
 mother say so hundreds of times--
---
there was nobody to set before Elizabeth
 any extenuation of the absent one's deceit.
---
" She was carrying the baby, and
---
Then we
 crossed about here-- she so sad and weary, and I speaking to her hardly
 at all, because of my cursed pride and mortification at being poor.

---
His wronged wife had foiled
 them by a fraud so grandly simple as to be almost a virtue.
---
her sitting down
 and
---
"," said a woman inside the waggon- tilt.
---
that the woman's memory served her well
---
Yet she had said.


---
as she wished
---
She had
 regretted his decision to be absent
---
mainly
 women going short journeys
---
She was one of those people whom nothing
 surprises, and
---
, she willingly volunteered.


---
On second thought she said.
---
she left him.
---
Just as she got across the
 landing to the door of the best parlour
---
she
 returned
---
that she would wait
---
who knew in spite of her maidenhood
---
That the quiet Elizabeth,, and, should have had zest for this
 revelry.
---
She was in a
 dress of white silk or satin
---
who awaited her
---
she entered the room
 immediately.


---
" she said,.


---
as she seized her hand
---
I
 see.
---
She flushed up, and.
---
I could have loved you
 always
---
-- I would have, gladly
---
"," she said.
---
when I know you

---
" But how can I have deceived me so--!
---
O how can I love!"


---
as I once did a man who
 has served us like this

before she could collect her thoughts
---
she saw him no more.

Elizabeth- Jane had grown accustomed to the novelty of her situation, and

Elizabeth- Jane was standing in the middle of her upstairs parlour,
