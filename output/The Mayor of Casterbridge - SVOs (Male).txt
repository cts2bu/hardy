The man was of fine figure, swarthy, and stern in aspect; and
---
he
 showed in profile a facial angle so slightly inclined as to be almost
 perpendicular.
---
He wore a short jacket of brown corduroy, newer than the
 remainder of his suit, which was a fustian waistcoat with white horn
 buttons, breeches of the same, tanned leggings, and a straw hat overlaid
 with black glazed canvas.
---
At his back he carried by a looped strap a
 rush basket, from which protruded at one end the crutch of a hay- knife,
 a wimble for hay- bonds being also visible in the aperture.
---
His measured,
 springless walk was the walk of the skilled countryman as distinct from
 the desultory shamble of the general labourer;.


---
while in the turn and
 plant of each foot there was, further, a dogged and cynical indifference
 personal to himself,
---
as
 he paced along
---
that the man was reading, or
---
which he kept before his eyes with some difficulty by the
 hand that was passed through the basket strap
---
whether it were an assumed one to escape
 an intercourse that would have been irksome to him
---
his taciturnity was unbroken, and
---
Sometimes the
 man's bent elbow almost touched her shoulder,, but
---
That the man and woman were husband and wife, and
---
, the family group was met by a turnip- hoer with his hoe on
 his shoulder, and his dinner- bag.
---
" he asked phlegmatically,.
---
the labourer did
 not understand him
---
And thinking, he added," Anything in the hay- trussing line?"


---
which he obviously was
---
Looking towards the village, he continued,"
---
I've been working within

---
I did n't go up-- not I.
---
The trusser and his family proceeded on their way, and.
---
, the frivolous contingent of visitors,
 including journeymen out for a holiday, a stray soldier or two come on
 furlough, village shopkeepers, and the like,;
 persons whose activities found a congenial field among the peep- shows,
 toy- stands, waxworks, inspired monsters, disinterested medical men who
 travelled for the public good, thimble- riggers, nick- nack vendors, and
 readers of Fate.


---
The man mentally weighed the two inscriptions
 and inclined to the former tent.


---
" I always like furmity; and so
 does Elizabeth- Jane; and" I've never tasted it," said the man.
---
However, he gave way to her
 representations, and
---
The young man and woman ordered a basin each of the mixture,.
---
the
 man, with the instinct of a perverse character, scented it quickly.

---
After a mincing attack on his bowl, he watched the hag's proceedings
 from the corner of his eye, and.
---
He winked to
 her, and.
---
The man as slily sent back money in payment.


---
He found the concoction, thus strongly laced, much more to his
 satisfaction than it had been in its natural state.
---
he persuaded her to
, and
---
The man finished his basin, and
---
The effect of it was soon
 apparent in his manner, and
---
But he turned a deaf ear to those bird- like chirpings.
---
He talked loud to
 the company.
---
the man had risen to serenity
---
At the end of the first basin; at the
 second he was jovial
---
signified by the shape of his face
---
; at the third, argumentative, at the fourth, the
 qualities, the occasional clench of
 his mouth, and the fiery spark of his dark eye, began
---
The ruin of good men by bad wives, and, more particularly, the
 frustration of many a promising youth's high aims and hopes and the
 extinction of his energies by an early imprudent marriage, was the
 theme.


---
He
 pointed at himself and family with a wave of the hand intended to bring
 out the penuriousness of the exhibition.


---
" I married at
 eighteen, like the fool that I was; and" I have n't more than fifteen shillings in the world, and yet I am a good
 experienced hand in my line. I'd challenge England; and if I were a free man again I'd be worth a thousand
 pound before I'd done o't. But a fellow never knows these little things
 till all chance of acting upon'em."


---
why men do n't want'em,
 should n't get rid of'em
---
Shall I say forty shillings?'" For my part I do n't see,"
  said the man in the tent.
---
sell'em
 by auction to men who are in need of such articles
---
Why, begad, I'd
 sell mine this minute!"


---
he had

---
" I've had my breedings in as good circles, I may say, as
 any man," he added," and
---
Then,
 crossing his legs, he resumed his pipe with a nicely- adjusted gaze at a
 point in the air.


---
The fuddled young husband stared for a few seconds at this unexpected
 praise of his wife, half in doubt of the wisdom of his own attitude
 towards the possessor of such qualities.
---
But he speedily lapsed into his
 former conviction, and
---
who had gone on lacing his
 furmity more and more heavily
---
But a quarter of an hour later the man,, though he was either so strong- minded or
 such an intrepid toper that he still appeared fairly sober,."
---
waited; yet he did not move.
---
In ten minutes the man broke
 in upon the desultory conversation of the furmity drinkers with.
---
" said the man.


---
I wish
---
," said he."
---
I'll take my tools, and.'
---
" Do n't, my chiel," whispered a buxom staylace dealer in voluminous
 petticoats,;" yer good man do n't know."


---
what he's
 saying
---
I be
---
," said the husband.
---
to give
 more," said the husband.
---
" Three guineas-- going for three guineas!" said the rheumy man.


---
No bid?" said the husband."
---
" I'll tell ye what-- I wo n't sell her for less than five," said the
 husband,.
---
" I'll sell
 her for five guineas to any man that will pay me the money, and treat
 her well; and
---
he shall have her for ever, and.

---
A dead silence
 followed his affirmation.


---
Upon the
 face of this he clinked down the shillings severally-- one, two, three,
 four, five.


---
that the
 man, in spite of his tantalizing declaration, was really in earnest
---
that, being out
 of work, he was, as a consequence, out of temper with the world, and
 society, and
---
breaking the silence,, Michael, listen to me.
---
shouted her husband, his
 resentment rising at her suggestion.
---
He took the sailor's notes and,
 and.


---
" he said kindly.

---
as he made towards the
 door
---
A stolid look of concern filled the husband's face,; and
---
as if, after all, he
 had not quite anticipated this ending
---
" he said.


---
He rose and.
---
In presence of this scene after the other there was a
 natural instinct to abjure man as the blot on an otherwise kindly
 universe;.


---
He's without
 doubt a stranger here."


---
" He came in about five minutes ago
---
" Serves the husband well be- right
---
" A comely
 respectable body like her-- what can a man want more?
---
od send, if a
 husband had behaved so to me!
---
his keacorn was raw
---
the man do seem."


---
The man stretched his elbows
 forward on the table leant his face upon his arms, and.
---
where the man reclined
---
the
 sleeper,, stay, and his basket
 with him
---
where he was
---
when
 the man awoke
---
He looked about-- at the
 benches-- at the table supported by trestles-- at his basket of tools-- at
 the stove where the furmity had been boiled-- at the empty basins-- at
 some shed grains of wheat-- at the corks which dotted the grassy floor.

---
Among the odds and ends he discerned a little shining object, and.
---
It was his wife's ring.


---
he thrust his hand into his breast- pocket.
---
This second verification of his dim memories was enough
---
; he knew now
.
---
He remained seated,.
---
" I must get out of this as soon as I can," he said deliberately
 at last, with the air of one who could not catch his thoughts without
 pronouncing them.
---
I had the
 furmity, and rum in it-- and.
---
Now, what am I
---
to do-- am I sober enough to walk
---
, I wonder?
---
"
  He stood up,.
---
that he was in fairly good condition for progress,
 unencumbered
---
Next he shouldered his tool basket, and.
---
he could
 carry it
---
Then lifting the tent door he emerged into the open air.


---
Here the man looked around with gloomy curiosity.
---
as he stood
---
He and his family
 had been weary, and
---
so that he now beheld it as a new thing
---
He was the only positive spectator of the hay- trusser's exit from the
 Weydon Fair- field.


---
He went on in silent thought,
.
---
When he reached a lane, a good mile from the scene of the
 previous evening
---
, the man pitched his basket and leant upon a gate.
---
A
 difficult problem or two occupied his mind.


---
he said to himself; and
---
that he did not
---
His general
 demeanour was enough to show how he was surprised and
---
nettled-- as much could be seen in his face, and
 in the way he nibbled a straw which he pulled from the hedge.
---
He knew

---
On this latter point he felt almost certain,.
---
when he had declared during a fuddle
---
that he
 would dispose of her
---
as he had done
---
him say
---
" he exclaimed."
---
he
 roared out.
---
When he was calmer
---
he turned to his original conviction that he must
 somehow find her and his little Elizabeth- Jane, and put up with the
 shame as best he could.
---
It was of his own making, and
---
he ought.
---
But first he resolved: and
---
than he
 had ever sworn before
---
to do it properly he required a fit place and
 imagery
---
to register an oath, a greater oath; for there was something fetichistic in this man's beliefs.


---
He shouldered his basket and and
---
as he walked
---
He instantly made towards the latter object.
---
Hence he reached the church without observation, and
---
he entered
---
The hay- trusser deposited his basket
 by the font,
---
till he reached the altar- rails
---
where he seemed
---
went up the nave, and
 opening the gate entered the sacrarium, to feel a
 sense of the strangeness for a moment; then he knelt upon the
 footpace.
---
Dropping his head upon the clamped book, he said aloud--


---
" I, Michael Henchard, on this morning of the sixteenth of September, do
 take an oath before God here in this solemn place that I will avoid all
 strong liquors for the space of twenty- one years to come, being a year
 for every year that I have lived.
---
I swear upon the book before
 me; and may I be strook dumb, blind, and helpless, if I break this my
 oath!"


---
When he had said it and.
---
he saw a thick jet of wood smoke suddenly

---
He went round to the door, and
---
Then he started on the search for his wife and child.


---
Though he examined and.
---
he described
---
he could gain

---
As money was short with him
---
he decided,
 after some hesitation,; but
---
that a
 certain shyness of revealing his conduct prevented Michael Henchard from

---
that he obtained no clue,
---
though everything was done by him
---
still he searched on,.
---
he had

---
there he derived intelligence that persons
 answering somewhat to his description had emigrated a little time
 before.
---
Then he said.


---
he would search no longer, and
---
that he would go and

---
which he had had for some time in his mind
---
Next day he started,.




3.



---
till he reached the town of Casterbridge,
 in a far distant part of Wessex
---
One of the two was she who had figured as the young
 wife of Henchard on the previous occasion
---
A glance was sufficient to inform the eye that this was Susan Henchard's
 grown- up daughter.
---
I thought?
---
And now
 he's drowned and!"
---
It was edged with black, and
" In
 affectionate memory of Richard Newson, mariner, who was unfortunately
 lost at sea, in the month of November184--, aged forty- one years."


---
" He is, or a connection by marriage
---
for he may be dead
---
He's not a near relation,

---
" He was a hay- trusser,
---
was n't he,?


---
when you last heard of him
---
" He was."


---
he never knew me
---
Mrs. Henchard paused for a moment, and.
---
I daresay."

" I am not so sure of that," said Mrs. Newson,.
---
," resumed Mrs. Newson,.


---
" I will just say a word-- you, Elizabeth- Jane,."


---
Mrs. Newson glanced
---
that he came back here to the next year's fair, and
---
he had gone
 to--
---
where?-- Casterbridge-- yes-- to Casterbridge, said he
---
Mrs. Newson would have rewarded the old woman as far as her small
 means afforded.
---
" he said.
---
he was living at
 Casterbridge
---
that he said it
---
there I think."


---
The risk of endangering a child's strong affection by
 disturbing ideas was to Mrs. Henchard
 too fearful a thing to contemplate.
---
Her simplicity-- the original ground of Henchard's contempt for
 her-- had allowed.
---
The history of Susan Henchard's adventures in the interim can be told
 in two or three sentences.
---
where Newson made a living for a few years as boatman and general handy
 shoreman
---
He then engaged in the Newfoundland trade, and
---
When Newson came home at the end of one winter he saw

---
he had so carefully sustained
---
There was then a time of sadness, in which she told him her doubts
 if she could live with him longer.
---
Newson left home again on the
 Newfoundland trade.
---
The vague news of his
 loss at sea a little later on solved a problem which had become torture
 to her meek conscience.
---
Of Henchard they heard nothing.
---
One day a month or
 so after receiving intelligence of Newson's death off the Bank of
 Newfoundland,, she was sitting on a
 willow chair in the cottage they still occupied,.
---
Susan's
 staunch, religious adherence to him as her husband in principle,, was demanded no more.
---
To pocket her pride and search for the first husband
 seemed, wisely or not, the best initiatory step.
---
But he might, on the other hand, have had too
 much sense to do so
---
; for in her time with him he had been given to bouts
 only, and.


---
if he lived
---
At any rate, the propriety of returning to him,, was
 unquestionable.
---
The awkwardness of searching for him lay in enlightening
.
---
him to take
---
what steps he might choose to that

---
to proceed two
 men passed outside the hedge, engaged in argumentative conversation.


---
" those men mentioned the
 name of Henchard in their talk-- the name of our relative?"


---
," said Mrs. Newson.


---
" That seems a hint to us that he is still here."


---
" Yes."

" Shall I run after them, and
---
He may be in the workhouse, or
 in the stocks, for all we know."


---
The sight reminded Mrs. Henchard- Newson and her daughter; and
---
" And less good beer than swipes," said a man with his hands in his
 pockets.


---
" Oh,' tis the corn- factor-- he's the man, and, so.
---
he has sold'em growed wheat, which they did n't know
 was growed
---
I've been a wife, and
---
I've been a mother, and
---
I never see
 such unprincipled bread in Casterbridge as this before.--
---
I am
---
how he stands in the town
---
if he is here
---
he must be
---
," said the old man, without taking
 his eyes from the window.
---
That's Mr. Henchard, the Mayor, at the end of the table, a
 facing ye; and
---
that's the Council men right and left....
---
" Henchard!" said Elizabeth- Jane, surprised, but by no means suspecting
 the whole force of the revelation.
---
Facing the window, in the
 chair of dignity, sat a man about forty years of age; of heavy frame,
 large features, and commanding voice; his general build being rather
 coarse than compact.
---
He had a rich complexion, which verged on
 swarthiness, a flashing black eye, and dark, bushy brows and hair.
---
When
 he indulged in an occasional loud laugh at some remark among the
 guests
---
, his large mouth parted so far back.


---
that he obviously still could boast of
---
if he had
 any
---
Susan Henchard's husband-- in law, at least-- sat before them,;.
---
He was
 jewelled studs, and a heavy gold chain.

---
Three glasses stood at his right hand; but,.


---
to his wife's surprise, the
 two for wine were empty,
---
he was sitting in a corduroy jacket, fustian
 waistcoat and breeches, and
---
you seen him, mother?
---
" I have seen him, and
---
Now I only want
---
whispered in her mother's ear," Does
 he seem to you not likely to befriend us?
---
I thought.
---
he looked a generous
 man
---
What a gentleman he is
---
, is n't he?
---
and how his diamond studs shine!

---
he might be in the stocks, or in
 the workhouse, or dead
---
Why do
 you feel so afraid of him?
---
-- he can

---
he do n't own such remote kin
---
I am not at all; I'll call upon him" I do n't know at all-- I ca n't tell. I feel so down."

" Do n't be that, mother
---
He is not
---
he
 would be
---
-- he overpowers me!
---
" They do n't fill Mr. Henchard's wine- glasses
---
him to be
---
He scorns all tempting liquors
---
that he sware

---
So they
 do n't press him,
---
Another elderly man, hearing this discourse, now joined in by inquiring,

---
" How much longer have he got, Solomon Longways?
---
why, it
 keeps a man up, no doubt
---
I do n't know the why and the wherefore of
.," said Longways.


---
" When did he lose his wife?
---
" I never knowed her.'
---
he came to Casterbridge
---
Solomon
 Longways replied with terminative emphasis,."
---
as if the fact of his
 ignorance of Mrs. Henchard were sufficient to deprive her history of all
 interest
---
But I know."


---
that' a's a banded teetotaller, and that if any of
 his men be ever so little overtook by a drop he's down upon'em as stern
 as the Lord upon the jovial Jews
---
" Has he many men, then?" said Elizabeth- Jane.


---
Why, my good maid, he's the powerfullest member of the Town
 Council, and quite a principal man in the country round besides.
---
Henchard's got a hand in it.
---
he'll go into other things too;
 and
---
where he makes his mistake
---
He worked his way up from nothing
; and
---
now he's a pillar of the town.
---
what he's

---
Not but been shaken a little to- year about this bad corn he has supplied in
 his contracts.
---
though Mr. Henchard has never cussed me
 unfairly, a little small
 man
---
I've seen the sun rise over Durnover Moor these
 nine- and- sixty year, and though Mr. Henchard has never cussed me
 unfairly ever since I've worked for'n, seeing I be but a little small
 man, I must say that I have never before tasted such rough bread.' there's a list at bottom o' the loaf as
 thick as the sole of one's shoe."


---
Henchard's voice arose above the rest
---
; he was telling a story of his
 hay- dealing experiences, in which he had outwitted a sharper who had
 been bent upon outwitting him.


---
" Ha- ha- ha!" responded his audience at the upshot of the story; and
," This is all very
 well; but how about the bad bread?"


---
" Well, I admit," he said.
---
" But I was
 taken in in buying it as much as the bakers who bought it
---
" And the poor folk to eat it whether or no," said the
 inharmonious man outside the window.


---
Henchard's face darkened.
---
," he
 said.
---
However, I have
 mended my arrangements on account o't.
---
Since I have found my business
 too large
---
, I have advertised for
 a thorough good man as manager of the corn department.
---
When I've got
 him
---
" inquired the
 man who had before spoken, and
---
Henchard's face had become still more stern at these interruptions, and

---
he drank from his tumbler of water.

---
Instead of vouchsafing a direct reply, he stiffly
---
I'll take it back with pleasure.
---
Henchard was.
---
Having said this, he sat down.




6.



---
Distinct from
 either there appeared a stranger-- a young man of remarkably pleasant
 aspect-- who carried in his hand a carpet- bag of the smart floral pattern
 prevalent in such articles at that time.


---
He was ruddy and of a fair countenance, bright- eyed, and slight in
 build.
---
He might possibly have passed by without stopping at all, or
---
at
 most for half a minute to glance in at the scene, had not his advent
 coincided with the discussion on corn and bread, in which event this
 history.
---
he whispered some inquiries of the other bystanders, and.


---
When he heard Henchard's closing words
---
,"," he smiled
 impulsively,.
---
He tore out the leaf,, and but,.


---
till he reached the door of the hotel, where one of the
 waiters who had been serving inside was now idly leaning against the
 doorpost
---
," he said,
---
Elizabeth- Jane had seen his movements and.
---
" he
 languidly answered;" but
---
I have never stayed there myself
---
as he seemed
---
The Scotchman, to be, thanked him, and.
---
While he was disappearing
 slowly down the street the waiter left the door, and
---
Henchard looked at it carelessly,.
---
which had held possession of his face
---
since the
 subject of his corn- dealings had been broached
---
He read the note slowly, and.


---
Men were putting their heads together in
 twos and threes,.
---
Square- built men showed a tendency to become hunchbacks
---
; men with
 a dignified presence lost it in a curious obliquity of figure, in which
 their features grew disarranged and one- sided,.
---
Only Henchard did not conform to these flexuous changes
---
; he
 remained stately and vertical, silently thinking.


---
what is best to do about him
---
where the young man has gone to
---
" He is respectable.
---
as
 stated, continued to hold him in abstraction till, whispering to his
 neighbour to take his place, he found opportunity to leave the chair.

---
This was just after the departure of his wife and Elizabeth.


---
he saw the waiter
---
He was a Scotchman seemingly."


---
" Did he say?"


---
how he had got it
---
" He wrote it himself, sir,."


---
as he stood outside the window
---
Is the young man in the hotel?"


---
He went to the Three Mariners,
---
The mayor walked up and down the vestibule of the hotel with his hands
 under his coat tails,.
---
as if he were merely seeking a cooler atmosphere
 than that of the room he had quitted
---
But there could be no doubt that
 he was in reality still possessed to the full by the new idea, whatever
 that might be.
---
At length he went back to the door of the dining- room,
 and.
---
this the
 Mayor took his hat, and
---
when the waiter had helped him on with a thin
 holland overcoat
---
his eyes, by a sort of
 attraction, turned and dwelt upon a spot about a hundred yards further
 down.
---
It was the house to which the writer of the note had gone-- the
 Three Mariners-- whose two prominent Elizabethan gables, bow- window, and
 passage- light could be seen from where he stood.
---
a while he strolled in that direction
---
This ancient house of accommodation for man and beast, now,
 unfortunately, pulled down.
---
as every passer knew, the
 ruddy polls of Billy Wills the glazier, Smart the shoemaker, Buzzford
 the general dealer, and others of a secondary set of worthies, of a
 grade somewhat below that of the diners at the King's Arms, each with
 his yard of clay
---
As a
 matter of fact, this state of things was not, as from the lack of a painter in Casterbridge
 who would undertake to reproduce the features of men so traditional.


---
Henchard stood without the inn for a few instants;
---
in other ways toning himself down
 to his ordinary everyday appearance, he entered the inn door.




7.



---
, shoulder to
 shoulder with his waiting- maids-- a stately slowness, however, entering
 into his ministrations by contrast with theirs,
---
Mr. Henchard is too high,

---
ourselves known to him
---
if his supper is on
 the tray
---
you can take it up to him.
---
this being at a time a house in
 which the twelve- bushel strength was still religiously adhered to by the
 landlord in his ale
---
He was now idly reading a copy of the local paper, and.


---
how his forehead shone, and
---
how nicely his
 hair was cut
---
The tremors in Susan Henchard's tone might have led any person but one
 so perfectly unsuspicious of the truth as the girl was, to surmise
 some closer connection than the admitted simple kinship as a means of
 accounting for them.


---
Two men were indeed talking in the adjoining chamber, the young
 Scotchman and Henchard, who, having entered the inn while Elizabeth- Jane
 was in the kitchen waiting for the supper,.
---
which
 Mrs. Henchard mechanically did,
---
Henchard seemed, and
---
in a moment he resumed:
?"
---
" Then," said Henchard,"?
---
I am under the impression that we have met by
 accident while waiting for the morning to keep an appointment with each
 other
---
My name is Henchard
---
" Surely you are the man
---
Jopp-- what was his name?"


---
said the young man.
---
" My name is Donald Farfrae.
---
I am in the corren trade
---
I have replied to no advertisement,
 and. I am on my way to Bristol-- from there to the
 other side of the warrld,! I have some inventions useful to the trade, and
" To America-- well, well," said Henchard, in a tone of disappointment, so
 strong as to make itself felt like a damp atmosphere."
---
And yet I could
 have sworn!"


---
you were the man
---
till
 Henchard resumed:"
---
Then I am
---
which I declare to Heaven
---
I did n't know
---
I've some hundreds
 of quarters of it on hand; and
---
I saw
.
---
But I should like; and
---
The young man reflected a moment or two.
---
I do n't know
---
that I have any
 objection
---
"," he said.
---
" I'm going to another country, and
---
Yes, I'll tell ye the whole of
 it
---
I can show ye by a sample in my
 carpet- bag."


---
after a pause,, he exclaimed," There, now, do you
 taste that."


---
the young man
 still replied, with some distress in his accents.


---
said Henchard conclusively.
---
Come to my house, I can find something better for' ee than cold ham and
 ale."


---
Donald Farfrae was grateful--
---
he feared
---
he must decline--
---
that he
 wished
---
" Very well," said Henchard quickly,.
---
But I tell you,
 young man,.
---
What shall I
 pay you for this knowledge?"


---
I do n't value it at all.
---
I thought, and
---
I might just as well
 let,
---
Henchard paused.
---
I sha n't soon forget this
---
"," he said.
---
I could n't believe!
---
you were not the man I had engaged
---
Says
 I to myself,'.'

---
He knows, and
---
who I am
---
that you are not the man who answered
 my advertisement, but a stranger
---
" Ay, ay," said the young man.


---
Henchard again suspended his words, and
---
then his voice came
 thoughtfully:"
---
the nose, too, is n't unlike his.
---
I reckon?
---
I am six foot one and a half
 out of my shoes.
---
Unluckily, I am bad at science, Farfrae; bad at
 figures-- a rule o' thumb sort of man.
---
-- I can
 see that.
---
I have been looking for such as you these two year, and
---
before I go
---
me ask this Though you are
 not the young man I thought you were, what's the difference
---
I wo n't mince matters.
---
I feel--
---
"," said the young man, in negative tones.
---
" I have
 formed a scheme, and
---
I find."


---
" No, no; I fain
---
I ca n't
---
he was rising
---
" When
 I was a young man I went in for that sort of thing too strong-- far too
 strong-- and was well- nigh ruined by it!
---
I did a deed on account of it
 which I shall be ashamed of to my dying day.
---
that I'd drink nothing stronger than
 tea for as many years
---
as I was old that day
---
I have kept my oath; and

---
though, Farfrae, I am sometimes that dry in the dog days that I could
 drink a quarter- barrel to the pitching
---
, I think o' my oath, and touch no
 strong drink at all."


---
" I'll no' press ye, sir--
---
I respect your vow."


---
" Well, I shall get a manager somewhere, no doubt
---
," said Henchard, with
 strong feeling in his tones.
---
before I see one
---
The young man appeared.
---
much moved by Henchard's warm convictions of
 his value
---
He was silent.
---
I wish
---
I could
 stay--
---
sincerely I would like to
---
"," he replied.
---
I want."





---
the mother's face being strangely bright
 since Henchard's avowal of shame for a past action
---
that Donald Farfrae had again
 rung his bell, no doubt to have his supper removed
---
; for humming a tune,
 and walking up and down, he seemed.
---
He sauntered
 out upon the landing, and.


---
When Elizabeth- Jane had carried down his supper tray, and
---
now the Scotchman had made himself so soon at home.


---
that, at the request
 of some of the master- tradesmen, he, too, was favouring the room with a
 ditty
---
would I be,
     
---
As I pass through Annan Water with my bonnie bands again
---
It was of such a kind that the snapping of a
 pipe- stem too long for him by old Solomon Longways, who was one of those
 gathered at the shady end of the room,.
---
the pathos of Donald's song was temporarily effaced.


---
And removing his pipe a finger's breadth from his lips, he
 said aloud,"."


---
Let," said the glazier, a stout,
 bucket- headed man, with a white apron rolled up round his waist.
---
And
 turning aside, he said in undertones,"?--
---
" Yes, straight from the mountains of Scotland, I believe,
---
" replied
 Coney.


---
Young Farfrae repeated the last verse.
---
with which he worked himself up to a
 climax
---
inquired Christopher Coney, from the background,
 with the tone of a man who preferred the original subject.
---
we be bruckle folk here-- the best o' us hardly honest sometimes, what
 with hard winters, and so many mouths to fill, and Goda'mighty sending
 his little taties so terrible small to fill'em with
---
" But, no!" said Donald Farfrae,;" the best of ye hardly honest-- not that surely?
---
what did n't belong to him
---
no, no!" said Solomon Longways,.
---
" That's only his
 random way o' speaking.'
---
A was always such a man of underthoughts."
---
( And
 reprovingly towards Christopher):" Do n't ye be so over- familiar with a
 gentleman that ye know nothing of-- and
---
Christopher Coney was silenced, and
---
as he could get no public sympathy
---
,
 he mumbled his feelings to himself:" Be dazed, if I loved my country
 half as well as the young feller do, I'd live by claning my neighbour's
 pigsties afore I'd go away!
---
For my part I've no more love for my country
 than I have for Botany Bay!"


---
" Come," said Longways;
---
the young man draw onward with his ballet
---
him breathe
---
him breathe,
---
He hain't got his
 second wind yet
---
I have! he at once rendered
" O Nannie" with faultless modulations, and another or two of the like
 sentiment, winding up at their earnest request with" Auld Lang Syne."


---
By this time he had completely taken possession of the hearts of the
 Three Mariners' inmates, including even old Coney.
---
the tone
 of his mind seemed
---
; he was to them like the poet of a new school who takes
 his contemporaries by storm; who is not really new, but is the first
 to articulate what all his listeners have felt, though but dumbly till
 then.


---
The silent landlord came and leant over the settle while the young
 man sang; and
---
said the Scotchman, with melancholy fatality in his voice,

---
," said Solomon Longways.
---
when such a man opens his mouth
---
" Nay, but ye mistake my country," said the young man, looking round upon
 them with tragic fixity,.
---
till his eye lighted up and
---
his cheek kindled
 with a sudden enthusiasm
---
He's a simple home- spun man,
---
as I may say?" inquired
 Christopher Coney.


---
Donald's eyes dropped into a remote gaze:
---
as he added
---
that his statements showed
---
him to be no
 less thoughtful than his fascinating melodies
---
him to be cordial
 and
---
He had seen no jest in ambiguities and roguery,; and
---
he did not appreciate them.
---
He seemed;.
---
the young Scotchman expressed his wish to
 retire,.
---
, Mr. Farfrae
 was at the foot.
---
that when confronting her he smiled; and
---
who has started himself on a flight of
 song whose momentum he can not readily check
---
then, with the manner of a
 temporarily light- hearted man,, he softly tuned an old
 ditty that she seemed to suggest--

         
---
" I've sent on my luggage-- Donald's eyes dropped into a remote gaze as he added:" But I said to
 myself,' unless I
 undertake it!' and I decided."

" As I came in by my bower door,
             As day was waxin' wearie,
          Oh wha came tripping down the stair
             But bonnie Peg my dearie."


---
, the latter was still in thought-- on quite
 another matter than a young man's song.


---
Her" he" was another man than her poor mother's.

---
" For myself" I did n't at all mind waiting a little upon him.

---
He's so respectable, and.

---
They thought him very simple not to know their grim broad way of talking
 about themselves here.
---
But of course he did n't know
---
-- he was in his mind!"
---
Meanwhile, the" he" of her mother was not so far away as even they
 thought.
---
After leaving the Three Mariners he had sauntered up and down
 the empty High Street,.

---
When the Scotchman sang his voice
---
" he had said to
 himself.
---
" I suppose' tis.
---
because I'm so lonely
---
I'd have given him a
 third share in the business to have stayed!"




9.



---
Mr. Henchard-- now habited
 no longer as a great personage, but as a thriving man of business--
---
Henchard, had

---
before he had noticed his acquaintance of
 the previous evening
---
He came back a few steps, Donald Farfrae opening
 the window further.


---
, I suppose?
---
Henchard looked at the
 bag as at an enemy.
---
there was no mistake about the young man's
 departure
---
," he said,"
---
Ah, my lad you should have been a wise man, and

---
," said Donald,.
---
when I say
---
He was a good man-- and
---
he's
---
there was no reason why he should have wished me good- bye."


---
then he had looked away
 again without nodding, or smiling, or saying a word.


---
He was always so.
---
if he takes so warmly to people who are
 not related to him at all
---
Now, surely,, may he not take as warmly to his own kin?"


---
The spectacle renewed his wife's conviction that, for her daughter's
 sake, she should strain a point to rejoin him.


---
that Mrs. Henchard decided, for good or for ill,
---
that his relative Susan, a
 sailor's widow, was in the town
---
whether or not
 he would recognize her
---
He had been described as a lonely widower; and

---
he had expressed shame for a past transaction of his life.
---
If he says no
---
if he thinks
---
it does not become the good position he has
 reached to in the town, to own--
---
us call on him as--
---
";" to let his distant
 kinfolk, say,'...
---
we are so-- little allied to him!"


---
if he say yes?
---
" In that case," answered Mrs. Henchard cautiously,"."


---
when and how he will see us-- or ME
---
that I fully know
---
I have no claim upon him-- that
 I am glad to find he is thriving
---
; that I hope
---
his life may be long and
 happy
---
He was bound also,.


---
Horses for sale were tied in rows, their forelegs on the pavement, their
 hind legs in the street, in which position they occasionally nipped
 little boys by the shoulder who were passing to school.
---
If he wondered
---
though all Henchard's carts and waggons were rattling
 past him
---
,, you knew it from perceiving the inside of his crimson mouth,
 and a target- like circling of his eyes.
---
Deliberation caused sundry
 attacks on the moss of adjoining walls with the end of his stick,
 a change of his hat from the horizontal to the less so
---
Henchard's
 house was one of the best,.
---
Mr. Henchard was not in the house, but in the store- yard.
---
Mr. Henchard could be found
---
He
 directed her to an office which she had not seen before, and."


---
His hat hung on a peg behind him, and the roses
 of his carpet- bag glowed from the corner of the room.


---
said the Scotchman, like a man who permanently ruled
 there.


---
He's engaged just now
---
the young
 man, apparently not recognizing her as the girl at the inn
---
He handed
 her a chair,.

---
waiting in great amaze at the young man's
 presence we may briefly explain.


---
how he came there
---
," said Henchard,.

---
I shall often think of this time, and."


---
he paused
---
Now I am not the man
---
And I'll speak.
---
I'll agree to'em willingly and' ithout a
 word of gainsaying; for, hang it, Farfrae, I like thee well!"


---
The young man's hand remained steady in Henchard's for a moment or two.

---
He looked over the fertile country that stretched beneath them, then
 backward along the shaded walk reaching to the top of the town.
---
His face
 flushed.


---
I never expected this
---
"-- I did not!
---
" he said.
---
No; I'll not go to America
---
; I'll stay and!"


---
which had lain lifeless in Henchard's
---
His hand,, returned the latter's
 grasp.


---
," said Donald Farfrae.


---
The face of Mr. Henchard beamed forth a satisfaction that was almost
 fierce in its strength."
---
he exclaimed.
---
Farfrae caught up his bag and.
---
as he had come
---
Henchard was all
 confidence now.


---
" I am the most distant fellow in the world
---
when I do n't care for a man
---
,"
  he said.
---
when a man takes my fancy
---
" But he takes it strong.
---
Now I am
 sure you can eat another breakfast?
---
I can always make a good meal in the morning.
---
I've got.
---
," said Farfrae with a smile.


---
" Well, of course, I did n't know.
---
I do n't drink it because of my oath,
 but
---
I am obliged."


---
at which Henchard heaped the young Scotchman's plate to a prodigal
 fulness
---
He would not rest satisfied, and.
---
till Farfrae had written for his
 luggage from Bristol
---
When
 it was done this man of strong impulses
---
that his new friend
 should take up his abode in his house--
---
He then took Farfrae round and, and the stores
 of grain, and other stock; and.




10.



---
a man came up to the
 door,.
---
as Henchard opened the door of the inner office to

---
The new manager!--he's in his office," said Henchard bluntly.


---
" In his office!" said the man, with a stultified air.


---
" I mentioned Thursday,
---
" said Henchard;" and
---
, I have engaged another manager.
---
At first I thought.
---
he must

---
I can wait
---
" I can say no more."

" You as good as engaged me," murmured the man.


---
" Subject to an interview," said Henchard.
---
I am sorry for you
---
the man came out,.
---
that his mouth twitched
 with anger, and
---
that bitter disappointment was written in his face
 everywhere
---
His dark pupils-- to have a red spark of light in
 them,-- turned indifferently
 round under his dark brows."
---
he said blandly.


---
" Can I speak to you-- not on business, sir?
---
" He looked at her more thoughtfully.


---
that a distant
 relative of yours by marriage, Susan Newson, a sailor's widow, is in the
 town, and
---
The rich rouge- et- noir of his countenance underwent a slight change.

---
he asked with difficulty.


---
This at once suggested to Henchard.
---
that the transaction of his early
 married life at Weydon Fair was unrecorded in the family history
---
It was
 more than he could have expected.
---
I am-- a good deal interested in your news
---
"," he said.
---
that
 he showed her out of the office and through the outer room, where Donald
 Farfrae was overhauling bins and samples with the inquiring inspection
 of a beginner in charge
---
Henchard preceded her through the door in the
 wall to the suddenly changed scene of the garden and flowers, and
 onward into the house.
---
to which he introduced her still

---
The dining- room exhibited the remnants of the lavish breakfast laid for Farfrae.
---
on one lay three huge folio
 volumes-- a Family Bible, a" Josephus," and a" Whole Duty of Man.
---
," he said, with a shake in his voice
 as he uttered her name, and sitting down himself."
---
he allowed
---
his hands
 to hang between his knees
---
while he looked upon the carpet
---
when did he die
---
" Father was lost last spring."


---
Henchard winced at the word" father,"."
---
" he asked.


---
I was twelve."


---
By such conversation he discovered the circumstances
 which had enveloped his wife and her child in such total obscurity that
 he had long ago believed them to be in their graves.
---
, he returned to the present."
---
" And you are her daughter Elizabeth- Jane?" repeated Henchard.
---
He arose,
.
---
I think,
---
" he said,
---
I should like....
---
His eye fell on Elizabeth's clothes, which, though
 a respectable suit of black, and her very best, were decidedly
 old- fashioned even to Casterbridge eyes.


---
that he had divined this without her
 being obliged to express it
---
He sat down at the table and.
---
which he put in the envelope with the
 letter
---
Sealing the
 whole up carefully, he directed it to" Mrs. Newson, Three Mariners Inn,"
  and.


---
" Deliver it to her personally, please," said Henchard."
---
Well, I am glad
, Elizabeth- Jane-- very glad.
---
He took her hand at parting, and.
---
The instant Henchard's state showed
 itself more distinctly;.


---
he sat in his dining- room
 stiffly erect,
---
as if he read his history
 there
---
he suddenly exclaimed,.
---
" I did n't think of that.

---
However, a something in Elizabeth- Jane soon assured him.
---
; for he had arranged
 in his note.


---
" said Henchard.
---
His keenly excited
 interest in his new friend the Scotchman was now eclipsed by this event,
 and
---
Donald Farfrae saw so little of him during the rest of the day that
 he wondered at the suddenness of his employer's moods.


---
the very words Mr. Henchard
 used.
---
I can say no more now.
---
till I have seen you
---
M. H."


 He said nothing about the enclosure of five guineas.
---
that he bought her
 back again
---
who had lain there in his silent unobtrusive rest for a space of
 fifteen hundred years
---
He was mostly found
---
lying on his side, in an oval
 scoop in the chalk, like a chicken in its shell; his knees drawn up to
 his chest; sometimes with the remains of his spear against his arm,
 a fibula or brooch of bronze on his breast or forehead, an urn at
 his knees, a jar at his throat, a bottle at his mouth; and mystified
 conjecture pouring down upon him from the eyes of Casterbridge street
 boys and men, who had turned a moment to gaze at the familiar spectacle
 as they passed by.


---
Apart from the sanguinary
 nature of the games originally played therein, such incidents attached
 to its past as these: that for scores of years the town- gallows had
 stood at one corner; that in1705 a woman who had murdered her husband
 was half- strangled and then burnt there in the presence of ten thousand
 spectators.
---
Some boys had
---
Possibly, too, the boys were timid
---
Henchard had chosen this spot as being the safest from observation which
 he could think of for meeting his long- lost wife, and at the same time
 as one easily to be found by a stranger after nightfall.
---
As Mayor of the
 town, with a reputation to keep up, he could not invite her his house.


---
Just before eight he approached the deserted earth- work and.
---
In
 a few moments he could discern a female figure creeping in by the great
 north gap, or public gateway.
---
-- there was no necessity for speech-- and the
 poor woman leant against Henchard, who supported her in his arms.


---
" I do n't drink," he said in a low, halting, apologetic voice.
---
I do n't drink now--
---
I have n't since that night.
---
" Those were his
 first words.


---
He felt.
---
After a
 minute or two he again began:

"!
---
If I had known, Susan
---
I took every possible step
.
---
that you
 had started for some colony with that man, and
---
because of him-- what other reason could there be?
---
I thought

---
I owed him faithfulness to the end of one of our lives-- foolishly

---
I believed
---
; I
 thought.
---
even in honour I dared
---
when he had paid so
 much for me in good faith
---
I meet you now.
---
only as his widow-- I consider
 myself
---
that, and that I have no claim upon you
---
Had he not died-- never!
---
I should
 never have come
---
" I do n't know.
---
if I had not thought
 like that
---
he said with kindly
 severity.
---
" I have thought of this plan:.
---
This would leave my shady, headstrong, disgraceful life
 as a young man absolutely unopened
---
I should have the pleasure of seeing my own only child under
 my roof, as well as my wife
---
" I am quite in your hands, Michael
---
to hear that," said Henchard gently.
---
I have proposed for a few
 hours
---
I have
; but
---
", I suppose?
---
till I come back
---
"," said Mrs. Henchard, after
 a pause.
---
Now I think
."


---
I must go back to Elizabeth- Jane, and
---
I'll go some way with you."


---
" Right," said Henchard."
---
" Never mind-- all in good time," said he."
---
He retreated, and.
---
Then Henchard himself went homeward,.
---
that by the
 time he reached his door
---
he was almost upon the heels of the unconscious
 woman from whom he had just parted
---
He watched her up the street, and
.



---
On entering his own door after watching his wife out of sight, the Mayor
 walked on through the tunnel- shaped passage into the garden, and thence
 by the back door towards the stores and granaries.
---
Henchard could see.
---
Donald Farfrae still seated
---
where he had left him,

---
Henchard entered,"
---
He stood behind Farfrae's chair,.
---
yet it was not without a dash
 of pity for the tastes of any one who could care to give his mind to
 such finnikin details.
---
Henchard himself was mentally and physically
 unfit for grubbing subtleties from soiled paper
---
; he had in a modern
 sense
---
"," he said at length,.
---
I am
---
He shut
 the account- books with friendly force.


---
Donald had wished; but
---
he already saw, and
---
that his
 friend and employer was a man who knew no moderation in his requests and
 impulses
---
he yielded gracefully.
---
He liked Henchard's warmth,; the great difference in their characters adding
 to the liking.


---
even if
 it inconvenienced him
---
the young man followed his companion
 through the private little door.
---
which, admitting directly into
 Henchard's garden,
---
Henchard said,"--."
---
He applied a light to the laid- in fuel, and
---
"," said Henchard,".
---
that two men should meet, and that at the end of the first day I should
 wish to speak to' ee on a family matter
---
But, damn it all, I am a lonely
 man, Farfrae
---
: I have; and
---
why should n't I tell
 it to' ee?"


---
" I'll be glad to hear it,
---
if I can be of any service
---
," said Donald,
.


---
his eyes to travel over the intricate wood- carvings of the
 chimney- piece, representing garlanded lyres, shields, and quivers, on
 either side of a draped ox- skull, and
---
" I've not been always," continued Henchard, his firm deep
 voice being ever so little shaken.
---
what I am now
---
He was plainly under that strange
 influence which sometimes prompts men to confide to the new- found
 friend what they will not tell to the old.
---
" I began life as a working
 hay- trusser, and
---
when I was eighteen
---
I married on the strength
---
" I heard in the town."


---
Well, I lost my wife
 nineteen years ago or so-- by my own fault....
---
One summer evening I was travelling for employment, and
---
I was a drinking man at that time."


---
Henchard paused a moment,.
---
so that his elbow rested
 on the table
---
, his forehead being shaded by his hand, which, however, did
 not hide the marks of introspective inflexibility on his features as

---
he narrated in fullest detail the incidents of the transaction with the
 sailor
---
Henchard went on
---
to describe his attempts to find his wife; the oath he
 swore; the solitary life he led during the years which followed.
---
I have

---
" kept my oath for nineteen years," he went on
---
;" I have risen to what you
 see me now."


---
being by nature
 something of a woman- hater, I have found it no hardship to keep mostly
 at a distance from the sex.
---
No wife could I hear of.
---
, I say, till this
 very day
---
what I've planned and
---
But, Farfrae," said Henchard
 gloomily," by doing right with Susan I.
---
" In the nature of things, Farfrae, it is almost impossible that a man
 of my sort should have the good fortune to tide through twenty years o'
 life without making more blunders than one.
---
I do a large trade wi' them
 in that line.
---
Well, one autumn when stopping there I fell quite ill, and

---
in my illness I sank into one of those gloomy fits I sometimes suffer
 from, on account o' the loneliness of my domestic life, when the world
 seems to have the blackness of hell, and,."


---
like Job, I could curse the
 day that gave me birth
---
" Ah, now, I never feel like it
---
," said Farfrae.


---
While in this state I
 was taken pity on by a woman-- a young lady I should call her,.
---
He was dead now, and her mother too, and she was as
 lonely as I.
---
when I was pulled down
---
why, for I was n't worth it
---
I wo n't go into
 particulars of what our relations were.
---
Though, Farfrae, between you and me, as
 man and man, I solemnly declare.
---
I was perhaps more, because o' my dreary state; and
---
At last I was well, and.
---
When I was gone
---
till latterly, I felt, and
---
I
 owed her something
---
as I had not heard of Susan for so
 long
---
that,, I would make this other one the only return I could make, and
---
such as I was
---
Donald showed his deep concern at a complication so far beyond the
 degree of his simple experiences.


---
what injury a man may cause around him
---
when I was young
---
if I had never been so selfish

---
Yet,, I must
 bitterly disappoint one of these women; and
---
For myself I do n't care--'twill all end one way.
---
Henchard paused in reverie.
---
" I feel."


---
I should like
---
as a man can
---
Od seize it, I must do a little more than that! I
 must-- though she did always brag about her rich uncle or rich aunt, and
 her expectations from' em-- I must send a useful sum of money to her, I
 suppose-- just as a little recompense, poor girl.... I've told ye I'm so bad at letters."

" And I will."

" Now, I have n't told you quite all yet. I am some sort of relation by marriage I want your advice."

" I think I'd run the risk, and." Never!" said Henchard.
---
" I am not going.
---
and I be going; and
---
Farfrae thereupon said no more.
---
The letter to the young Jersey woman was
 carefully framed by him, and
---
Henchard saying,," I feel it a great relief, Farfrae,!
---
he might be from the state of his
 pocket
---
" I do.
---
And I'm sorry for ye!
---
" said Farfrae.


---
When he was gone
---
Henchard copied the letter, and,.


---
from which he walked back thoughtfully
---
he said.
---
which Michael Henchard hired for his wife Susan under her
 name of Newson-- in pursuance of their plan
---
As soon, with a
 white- aproned servant and all complete, Henchard paid them a visit,
 and.
---
carefully
 hoodwinked by the very general tone of the conversation that
 prevailed-- a proceeding which seemed to afford some humour to Henchard,
.
---
The visit was repeated
 again and again with business- like determination by the Mayor, who
 seemed to have schooled himself into a course of strict mechanical
 rightness towards this woman of prior claim, at any expense to the later
 one and to his own sentiments.


---
when Henchard came
---
he
 said drily,"."


---
" Not at all," said Henchard, in rough benignity.
---
whose like I've never been
 able to lay hands on before
---
I shall soon be able to leave everything
 to him, and have more time to call my own than I've had for these last
 twenty years."


---
Henchard's visits here grew so frequent and so regular.
---
His well- known haughty indifference to the
 society of womankind, his silent avoidance of converse with the sex,
 contributed a piquancy to what would otherwise have been an unromantic
 matter enough.
---
his choice was
 inexplicable, except on the ground that the engagement was a family
 affair in which sentimental passion had no place;
---
Mrs. Henchard was so pale that the boys
 called her" The Ghost.
---
at which his face would darken with an expression of
 destructiveness towards the speakers ominous to see
---
he said
 nothing.


---
He pressed on the preparations for his union, or rather reunion, with
 this pale creature in a dogged, unflinching spirit which did credit
 to his conscientiousness.
---
Nobody would have conceived from his outward
 demeanour that there was no amatory fire or pulse of romance acting as
 stimulant to the bustle going on in his gaunt, great house; nothing
 but three large resolves-- one, to make amends to his neglected Susan,
 another, to provide a comfortable home for Elizabeth- Jane under his
 paternal eye; and a third,
---
Susan Henchard entered a carriage for the first time in her life.
---
He, however, was too inexperienced, too thoughtful,
 too judicial, too strongly conscious of the serious side of the
 business,.
---
That required
 the special genius of Christopher Coney, Solomon Longways, Buzzford, and
 their fellows.
---
since I had my settlement in this here town
---
,"
  said Coney;" but!
---
if I ever see
---
a man wait so long before to take
 so little
---
There's a chance even for thee after this, Nance Mockridge."
 
---
The remark was addressed to a woman who stood behind his shoulder-- the
 same who had exhibited Henchard's bad bread in public when Elizabeth and
 her mother entered Casterbridge.


---
if I'd marry any such as he, or thee either
---
And as for he-- well, there--(lowering her voice)' tis said
'."


---
" And now he's worth ever so much a minute
---
When a
 man is said
---
" to be worth so much a minute, he's a man to be considered!"


---
Turning, he saw a circular disc reticulated with creases, and."
---
," he said,"
---
Here's Mrs. Newson, a mere skellinton,
---
has got another husband,.
---
" I have not.
---
" Yes; with the blessing of God leather breeches shall go."

"' Tisn't worth my old while to think of another husband," continued Mrs.
 Cuxsom."
---
And yet I'll lay my life
---
I'm as respectable born as she.
---
-- I can mind her.
---
I do, hee- hee
---
", I do!
---
" said Christopher Coney.


---
" And well do I
---
-- for I was getting up husband- high at that time-- one- half
 girl, and t'other half woman,.
---
that I do--
---
I used
---
Ah, the miles to walk then; and now I can hardly step
 over a furrow!"


---
Their reminiscences were cut short by the appearance of the reunited
 pair-- Henchard looking round upon the idlers with that ambiguous gaze
 of his, which at one moment seemed to mean satisfaction, and at another
 fiery disdain.


---
though he do call himself a
 teetotaller
---
," said Nance Mockridge.
---
he's well enough!
---
If I had a
 choice as wide as the ocean sea
---
I would n't wish for a better man.
---
said Solomon.
---
" There was a man dropped down dead yesterday, not so very
 many miles from here; and what wi' that, and this moist weather,' tis
 scarce worth one's while to begin any work o' consequence to- day.
---
I'm in
 such a low key with drinking nothing but small table
---
that I shall call and
---
as I pass
 along
---
" I do n't know but
---
that I may as well go with' ee, Solomon
---
," said
 Christopher;"."





---
I'm as clammy as a cockle- snail
---
than he could give he
---
Among other things he had the iron railings,
 that had smiled sadly in dull rust for the last eighty years, painted
 a bright green, and the heavy- barred, small- paned Georgian sash windows
 enlivened with three coats of white.
---
He was as kind to her as a man,
 mayor, and
---
" I wo n't be too gay on any account,
---
as He used
---
Henchard had become very fond of her, and
---
" I happened, so
---
I made it up.


---
" Ay-- of course-- to be sure," he replied in his leonine way."
---
Henchard was looking silently,, at this head of
 hair, which in colour was brown-- rather light than dark.
---
as he often did
---
" I thought

---
he said to his wife.


---
Did I
---
What I meant
---
, I know--
---
but I was n't aware it lightened ever?
---
as Henchard went on
---
Now Susan, I want.
---
-- I do n't like for my own flesh and blood.
---
I'll
 advertise it in the Casterbridge paper
---
Well, then, I shall do it peremptorily."
---
," he said,
---
Then Mrs. Henchard acted somewhat inconsistently
---
is it not a slight upon Newson
---
-- now he's dead and?"


---
in which everything depended upon
 his memory
---
that Donald and Mr. Henchard were inseparables
---
When
 walking together Henchard would lay his arm familiarly on his manager's
 shoulder,.
---
as if Farfrae were a younger brother,
---
Donald had said,
---
In Henchard's somewhat lonely life he evidently found the young
 man as desirable for comradeship.

---
as he was useful for consultations
---
Donald's brightness of intellect maintained in the corn- factor the
 admiration it had won at the first hour of their meeting.
---
that he entertained of the
 slim Farfrae's physical girth, strength, and dash
---
The poor
 opinion, and but ill- concealed, was more than
 counterbalanced by the immense respect he had for his brains.


---
Her quiet eye discerned that Henchard's tigerish affection for the
 younger man, his constant liking to have Farfrae near him, now and then
.
---
which, however, was checked in a
 moment when Donald exhibited marks of real offence
---
I like a fellow to talk to.
---
that he had

---
The fact met her at the Three Mariners, since
 on the occasions on which she had entered his room he had never raised
 his eyes.
---
that he looked, to Elizabeth- Jane's half- conscious,
 simple- minded, perhaps pardonable, disappointment
---
that it might be apparent only-- a way of turning his eyes that Mr.
 Farfrae had
---
that was afforded by the fact of Donald being the depositary
 of Henchard's confidence in respect of his past treatment of the pale,

---
The farmer's boy could sit under his barley- mow
 and the red- robed judge, when he condemned a sheep- stealer,
 pronounced sentence to the tune of Baa, that floated in at the window
 from the remainder of the flock browsing hard by; and at executions
 the waiting crowd stood in a meadow immediately before the drop, out of
 which the cows had been temporarily driven to give the spectators room.


---
A street of farmers' homesteads-- a
 street yet echoing with the thump of
 the flail, the flutter of the winnowing- fan, and the purr of the milk
 into the pails-- a street-- this
 was the Durnover end of Casterbridge.

 Henchard,
---
his waggons were often down that way.

---
As this was the granary whose contents Henchard was
 removing
---
the request had something to do with his business,
 and
---
He looked up at the church clock, and

---
before he had seen her
---
he moved
 and
---
He,
 too, was plainly expecting some one
---
In a few minutes he looked at his watch, and.


---
He must
 have heard the slight movement for he looked up, and.


---
" Ah-- it's Miss Newson
---
," he said as soon as he could see into the
 granary.
---
" I did n't know.
---
I have kept the appointment, and

---
" O Mr. Farfrae" so have I.
---
But I did n't know,
---
I wished
---
-- at least, that is, I am afraid there may be
 a mistake.
---
Indeed, at no hand would I have thought of it!
---
And he held up his.


---
if the passer were about to enter and declare himself
 their summoner
---
," said Farfrae.
---
Miss Newson"-- and Donald's
 voice musically undulated between two semi- tones as it always did when
 he became earnest--"it's; but
---
he said, in tones of extreme delicacy."
---
though Farfrae, having got
 over his first concern at the situation, seemed
---
" Ah-- now I'll go and
---
get ye an umbrella," he said.


---
Farfrae walked slowly
 after,,"."





---
As I came down through Cannobie
---
Donald Farfrae's gaze, it is true,

---
he was
 only one.
---
Henchard gave Elizabeth- Jane a box of delicately- tinted gloves
 one spring day.
---
But Donald Farfrae admired her, too; and
---
; the men were dropping off homeward one by one.

---
The last to leave was a round- shouldered, blinking young man of nineteen
 or twenty, whose mouth fell ajar on the slightest provocation, seemingly
 because there was no chin to support it.
---
Henchard called aloud to him!"


---
as
 he went out of the gate," Here-- Abel Whittle
---
Whittle turned, and."
---
," he said,
---
as if he knew
---
what I say
---
I'm not going."


---
Then Abel Whittle left, and Henchard and Farfrae; and

---
Now there was good reason for this command on Henchard's part.
---
as he was called
---
Poor
 Abel,, had an inveterate habit of over- sleeping himself
 and coming late to his work.
---
His anxious will was; but
---
if his comrades omitted
---
that he always
 tied round his great toe and
---
to pull the string left hanging out the window for that
 purpose, his will was as wind.
---
He did not arrive in time.


---
As he was often second hand at the hay- weighing, or at the crane.
---
this
 affliction of Abel's was productive of much inconvenience
---
For two
 mornings in the present week he had kept the others
---
there was no Whittle.
---
At half- past six Henchard
 entered the yard; the waggon was horsed; and

---
that Abel was
---
the other man had been waiting twenty minutes.
---
Then Henchard swore, and

---
Whittle coming up breathless at that instant,;.


---
the corn- factor turned on
 him, and
---
if he
 were behind once more
---
that, by God, he would come and
---
sommit wrong in my make, your worshipful!" said Abel,
" especially in the inside,
---
I've said my few scrags of prayers. I'd got man's wages, whereas I never enjoy my bed
 at all, for no sooner do I lie down than I be asleep, and afore I be
 awake I be up. I've fretted my gizzard green about it, maister, but what
 can I do? Now last night, afore I went to bed, I only had a scantling o'
 cheese and--"

" I do n't want!"" To- morrow the waggons must
 start at four, and
---
I'll mortify thy
 flesh for thee!"

" But let, your worshipful----"

 Henchard turned away.


---
" He asked me and to the yard in general."
---
he questioned me, and!"
---
said Abel,
---
Now, I shall twitch like a
 moment- hand all night to- night for fear o' him!"


---
But Abel was missing.
---
Henchard appeared in the garden doorway
---
Where's Abel
 Whittle?
---
Henchard went off,
---
entered Abel's house, a little cottage in Back
 Street, the door of which was never locked.
---
the corn- factor shouted a
 bass note so vigorously that Abel started up instantly, and beholding
 Henchard standing over him.


---
which had not much relation to getting on his clothes
---
The unhappy Whittle threw on his sleeve waistcoat, and.
---
while Henchard thrust his
 hat over his head
---
Whittle then trotted on down Back Street
---
who had been to Henchard's house
---
he soon perceived
---
that showed below his waistcoat
---
said Farfrae,
---
Henchard being some way in the rear by this time.


---
" he said, and
---
he'd mortify my flesh
---
I did n't get up sooner
---
now
 he's a- doing on't!
---
Mr. Farfrae; things do
 happen queer sometimes!
---
I be,; but
---
since he do command
---
I shall kill myself afterwards
---
how I feel such things, Maister
 Farfrae, and how forlorn thoughts get hold upon me.
---
Yes-- I shall do

---
I feel!
---
I'm afeard
---
" I must n't!
---
" I do n't care, nor anybody else!'
---
what Mr. Henchard said
---
" Hullo, hullo!" said Henchard,.
---
" Who's sending him
 back?"


---
All the men looked towards Farfrae.


---
" I am," said Donald.
---
" I say."


---
" And I say!
---
if I am manager
---
" Not," said Farfrae."
---
He either goes home, or
---
I march
 out of this yard for good."


---
Henchard looked at him with a face stern and red.
---
But he paused for
 a moment, and
---
Donald went up to him,.


---
for he saw in
 Henchard's look that he began to regret this
---
" Come," said Donald quietly," a man o' your position should ken better,
 sir!
---
him remember
---
He presently added, in a tone of one bitterly hurt:
?
---
Ah-- I know why!
---
I've told ye the secret o'
 my life-- fool that I was to do't-- and you take advantage of me!"


---
" I had forgot it
---
," said Farfrae simply.


---
Henchard looked on the ground,.

---
Farfrae learnt from the men that Henchard had kept Abel's
 old mother in coals and snuff all the previous winter, which made him
 less antagonistic to the corn- factor
---
But Henchard continued moody and
 silent, and
---
when one of the men inquired of him
---
, he said shortly,
---
He's master here!
---
Morally he was
---
who had
 hitherto been the most admired man in his circle
---
Henchard,, was.
---
," he said.
---
" I'll come."


---
" But please will Mr. Farfrae come?"
---
" I am going that way.... Why Mr. Farfrae?" said Henchard, with the fixed
 look of thought.
---
" Why do people always want Mr. Farfrae?"


---
" I suppose.
---
because they like him so
---
" Oh-- I see--
---
They like him because he's
 cleverer than Mr. Henchard, and
---
because he knows more; and"


---
, in short,
 Mr. Henchard ca n't hold a candle to him-- hey?
---
And he's, and Henchard's a fool to him,'
---
He's a
 diment
---
-- he's a chap
---
-- he's the best--
---
he's the horse for my money,'

---
He's the most understanding man o' them two
 by long chalks
---
he was the master instead of Henchard
---
"

," Henchard replied with covered gloom."
---
And I am coming
---
The
 boy departed, and
---
Henchard murmured,?"


---
he were master here
---
He went towards Durnover.
---
On his way he overtook Farfrae.
---
Henchard looking mostly on the ground
---
Donald inquired.


---
" Yes, I am very well
---
," said Henchard.

"
---
I am going there.
---
" I'll go with ye."


---
As Henchard did not reply Donald
---
practised a piece of music sotto voce,
 till, getting near the bereaved people's door, he stopped himself with--

" Ah,.
---
as their father is dead
---
I wo n't go on with such as that
---
How could
 I forget?"


---
" I am sorry
---
if I have hurt yours, sir
---
," replied Donald,.
---
The cloud lifted from Henchard's brow, and
---
as Donald finished the
 corn- merchant turned to him,.


---
" I have been hearing things that vexed me
---
," he said.
---
Now, I do n't
 want
---
I have, and
---
that were not very plain to him
---
On Henchard's
 part there was now again repose; and
---
whenever he thought of
 Farfrae
---
he often regretted.




16.



---
that he had
 told the young man his whole heart, and
---
On this account Henchard's manner towards Farfrae insensibly became
 more reserved.
---
He was courteous-- too courteous-- and
---
Farfrae was quite
 surprised at the good breeding which now for the first time
.
---
he had hitherto thought
 undisciplined, if warm and sincere
---
The corn- factor seldom or never
 again put his arm upon the young man's shoulder.
---
He left off and."
---
Hoy, Farfrae,
 boy, come and!
---
Then one
 day Donald Farfrae broached the subject to Henchard by asking if he
 would have any objection to lend some rick- cloths to himself and a few
 others, who contemplated getting up an entertainment of some sort on
 the day named, and required a shelter for the same, to which they might
 charge admission at the rate of so much a head.


---
" Have as many cloths," Henchard replied.


---
When his manager had gone about the business Henchard
---
It certainly had been very remiss of him,.
---
as Mayor, he
 thought,
---
But Farfrae had been so cursed quick in his movements.

---
he determined

---
if the other Councilmen would leave the matter in his hands
---
So Henchard set about his preparations for a really brilliant
 thing--.
---
As for Farfrae's
 little affair, Henchard nearly forgot it
---
it coming into his mind
---
; except once now and then when,
 on, he said to himself," Charge admission at
 so much a head-- just like a Scotchman!--who is going to pay anything
 a head?"
---
He had grown so dependent upon Donald that he could scarcely resist
 calling him in to consult.
---
But by sheer self- coercion he refrained.
---
No,
 he thought,
---
Farfrae would be suggesting such improvements in his damned
 luminous way that in spite of himself he, Henchard, would sink to the
 position of second fiddle, and only scrape harmonies to his manager's
 talents.


---
that he meant
---
He advertised about the town, in long posters of a pink colour,.
---
Moreover, not forgetting his principles, Henchard provided a
 mammoth tea, of which everybody who lived in the borough was invited to
 partake without payment.
---
Passing to and fro the Mayor beheld the unattractive exterior of
 Farfrae's erection in the West Walk, rick- cloths of different sizes
 and colours.
---
He was easy in his mind now,.


---
Henchard wished.
---
he had not
 been quite so sure about the continuance of a fair season
---
by three
 o'clock Henchard discerned
---
that his project was doomed
---
said Henchard, after the lapse of
 half- an- hour,.
---
during which time only two men and a woman had stood up to
 dance
---
" They are at Farfrae's affair in the West Walk
---
Henchard walked away moodily.
---
the whole scene presented the most melancholy
 appearance Henchard gave orders that the proceedings were to be
 suspended, and
---
Henchard returned to his house,.
---
He soon saw.
---
The notes of a stringed band came from the
 enclosure that Farfrae had erected-- the pavilion as he called it-- and
 when the Mayor reached it.
---
he perceived
---
Henchard went round and.


---
the usually sedate Farfrae was in the midst of
 the other dancers in the costume of a wild Highlander,.
---
For a moment Henchard could not help
.
---
Then he perceived the immense admiration for the Scotchman
 that revealed itself in the women's faces; and
---
Donald had disappeared for a time to
 return in his natural garments
---
, he had an unlimited choice of partners,
.


---
He did not care, and
---
when he went into the dark
---
for there he heard

---
A few, I suppose.:

" Mr. Henchard's rejoicings could n't say good morning to this
---
" A man must be a headstrong stunpoll to think folk would go up to that
 bleak place to- day."


---
" Where would his business be?'
---
Twas verily Fortune sent him to
 Henchard.
---
His accounts were like a bramblewood.

---
when Mr. Farfrae came
---
He used.
---
But now this accomplished young man does it all by ciphering and
 mensuration.
---
Then the wheat-- to taste so strong
 o' mice when made into bread-- Farfrae has a plan for purifying,.
---
O yes, everybody
 is full of him, and
---
" But he wo n't do it for long, good- now
---
" No!" said Henchard to himself behind the tree."
---
if he do
---
Or, he'll be

---
that he's built
 up in these eighteen year
---
He went back to the dancing pavilion.
---
Farfrae was footing a quaint
 little dance with Elizabeth- Jane-- an old country thing, the only one she
 knew, and
---
though he considerately toned down his movements
---
to suit her
 demurer gait, the pattern of the shining little nails in the soles of
 his boots became familiar to the eyes of every bystander.
---
, so Mr. Farfrae had said, and.


---
that it was very popular
 in his own country
---
he did not give it.
---
He seemed."
---
," he
 said, like one whose mind was elsewhere,"
---
Look here, Farfrae I'll go to Port- Bredy Great
 Market.
---
Donald drew aside.
---
Cut ye out quite, has n't he?"


---
he did, and

---
where he's beat you
---
" He'll be top- sawyer soon of you two, and
---
" No," said Henchard gloomily."
---
He wo n't be that,."
---
because he's shortly

---
He looked towards Donald, who had come near."
---
Mr.
 Farfrae's time as my manager is drawing to a close?"


---
who could now read the lines and folds of Henchard's
 strongly- traced face
---
The young man,, quietly
 assented; and
---
asked he
 simply replied.


---
that Mr. Henchard no longer required his help
---
Henchard went home, apparently satisfied.
---
when his
 jealous temper had passed away
---
But in the morning,, his heart sank within him.
---
what he had

---
He was the more disturbed.




17.



---
when he found
---
that this time
 Farfrae was determined
---
Elizabeth- Jane had perceived from Henchard's manner.
---
Mrs. Henchard,, had gone away,.
---
A man followed in a few minutes, and
---
he recognized her.
---
It was Farfrae--
---
which had signified his dismissal
---
and I've been looking for ye everywhere!
---
"
  he said,."
---
May I walk on with you as far as your street- corner?"


---
till Farfrae said,
---
like that I'm going

---
I hoped."


---
that he might not hear her
---
-- perhaps he had heard her after all:


---
What he would have asked her and
---
he did not say,
---
" I never found out
---
," said Donald, in his undulating tones.
---
," said
 Donald Farfrae
---
And I'll not come up to your door; but part from you
 here
---
; lest it make your father more angry still."


---
Farfrae returning into the dark Bowling Walk, and

---
O dear me-- what am I at?
---
how he was rising in favour among
 the townspeople; and
---
that
 Farfrae's days as manager were numbered,
---
His occult breathings to her might be
 solvable by his course in that respect.


---
The next day was windy-- so windy that walking in the garden she picked
 up a portion of the draft of a letter on business in Donald Farfrae's
 writing, which had flown over the wall from the office.
---
Farfrae and Henchard had

---
if Farfrae were going away from the town
---
that he was not going
---
A man
 following the same trade as Henchard, but on a very small scale, had
 sold his business to Farfrae, who was forthwith about to start as corn
 and hay merchant on his own account.


---
that he meant
---
yet, would a man have endangered his suit by setting up a business in opposition
 to Mr. Henchard's?
---
only which had led him
---
that by this time he had discovered
---
her heart going out to him
---
who had been hurt at finding that Farfrae did not mean to
 put up with his temper any longer
---
Henchard,, was incensed beyond measure.
---
when
 he learnt
---
what the young man had done as an alternative
---
that he first became aware of
 Farfrae's coup for establishing himself independently in the town; and

---
his voice might have been heard as far as the town- pump expressing his
 feelings to his fellow councilmen
---
that, though under
 a long reign of self- control he had become Mayor and
---
, there was still the same unruly volcanic stuff beneath the
 rind of Michael Henchard.


---
as when he had sold his wife at Weydon Fair
---
" Well, he's a friend of mine, and
---
Did n't he come here without a sound shoe to his voot?

---
whatever he wanted?
---
And now he's defied me!
---
I said' Name
 your own price.' I'd have shared my last crust with that young fellow
 at one time, I liked him so well. But damn him,
 I'll have a tussle with him now-- at fair buying and selling, mind-- at
 fair buying and selling! And if I ca n't overbid such a stripling as he,
 then I'm not We'll show!"


---
His friends of the Corporation did not specially respond.
---
Henchard was
 less popular now
---
than he had been when nearly two years before
---
, they
 had voted him to the chief magistracy on account of his amazing
 energy.
---
So he went out of the hall and down the street alone.


---
Reaching home he seemed.

---
He called Elizabeth- Jane.
---
how he looked
---
" Nothing to find fault with," he said,."
---
Only I
 want.
---
That man, Farfrae-- it is about him.
---
I've
 seen
---
him talking to you two or three times
---
-- he danced with' ee at the
 rejoicings, and.
---
Have you made him any foolish promise?
---
I have promised him nothing."


---
I particularly wish."


---
you not to see him
 again
---
" I do.
---
He's an enemy to our house!"


---
he sat down, and
---
I make request that henceforth you and my stepdaughter be as
 strangers to each other.
---
I trust,.


---
One would almost have supposed Henchard.
---
that no better modus vivendi could be arrived at with Farfrae than by
 encouraging him to become his son- in- law
---
With all domestic finesse of that kind he was hopelessly at
 variance.
---
Loving a man or hating him, his diplomacy was; and
---
Meanwhile Donald Farfrae had opened the gates of commerce on his own
 account at a spot on Durnover Hill-- as far as possible from Henchard's
 stores, and with every intention of keeping clear of his former friend
 and employer's customers.
---
, it seemed to the younger man, room
 for both of them and to spare.
---
with his native sagacity he saw
 opportunity for a share of it
---
So determined was he.


---
that he refused his first customer-- a
 large farmer of good repute--
---
because Henchard and this man had dealt
 together within the preceding three months
---
" He was once my friend
---
," said Farfrae," and
---
for me to take
 business from him
---
I am sorry to disappoint you, but
---
I can not hurt the
 trade of a man who's been so kind to me."


---
that his northern energy was an overmastering force
 among the easy- going Wessex worthies, or
---
whatever he touched
---
that he prospered in
---
Like Jacob
 in Padan- Aram, he would no sooner humbly limit himself to
 the ringstraked- and- spotted exceptions of trade than the
 ringstraked- and- spotted would multiply and prevail.


---
Farfrae's character was just the reverse of Henchard's,
.


---
who might not inaptly be described-- as a
 vehement gloomy being who had quitted the ways of vulgar men without
 light to guide him on a better way
---
Farfrae duly received the request to discontinue attentions to
 Elizabeth- Jane.
---
His acts of that kind had been so slight that the
 request was almost superfluous.
---
Yet he had felt a considerable interest
 in her, and
---
after some cogitation he decided.
---
as he might
---
when, avoid collision with his former friend,
 Farfrae was compelled, in sheer self- defence,.
---
He could no longer parry the fierce attacks
 of the latter by simple avoidance.
---
Northern insight matched against Southern doggedness-- the dirk
 against the cudgel-- and Henchard's weapon was one which, if it did not
 deal ruin at the first or second stroke, left him afterwards well- nigh
 at his antagonist's mercy.


---
Donald was always ready, and even anxious,, but
---
the Mayor invariably gazed stormfully past him,
 like one who had endured and lost on his account, and; nor.
---
The large farmers, corn- merchants, millers, auctioneers,
 and others had each an official stall in the corn- market room, with
 their names painted thereon; and when to the familiar series of
" Henchard,"" Everdene,"" Shiner,"" Darton," and so on, was added one
 inscribed" Farfrae," in staring new letters, Henchard was stung into
 bitterness; like Bellerophon, he wandered away from the crowd, cankered
 in soul.


---
From that day Donald Farfrae's name was seldom mentioned in Henchard's
 house.
---
her husband would say,"?"




18.



---
Henchard,, except in moments of irritation, sent at once for the
 richest, busiest doctor, whom he supposed to be the best.
---
Henchard sat down alone.
---
He was startled to see
 a letter for him from Jersey in a writing he knew too well, and.
---
He took it up in his hands and; and
---
then he
 read it as an unimportant finale to conjecture.


---
That such reunion had been the only
 straightforward course open to him.



---
" For the handsome sum you forwarded to me as a plaster to the wound I
 heartily thank you.

" I am now on my way to Bristol,. I hope. I shall return through Casterbridge
 and Budmouth, where I shall take the packet- boat. I shall be in the coach which changes
 horses at the Antelope Hotel at half- past five Wednesday evening; I
 shall be wearing with a red centre, and. I should prefer this plan of receiving them to having them
 sent.-- I remain still, yours; ever,

" LUCETTA"


 Henchard breathed heavily."
---
that he had in his mind
---
The contingency was, of course, the death of
 Mrs. Henchard.


---
As requested, he sealed up Lucetta's letters, and;.
---
this plan of returning them by hand
 being apparently a little ruse of the young lady for exchanging a word
 or two with him on past times
---
He would have preferred;
 but
---
,
 he went at dusk and.


---
Henchard crossed over to
 it; but
---
he gave the matter up and
---
Meanwhile Mrs. Henchard was weakening visibly.
---
the first
 sparrow shook himself, the silence in Casterbridge--
---
Without preface, and as the
 continuation of a scene already progressing in her mind, Mrs. Henchard
 said:"--?"


---
' Twas I did it."


---
you to marry Mr. Farfrae
---
Henchard hates him."


---
when he observed
---
He rang
 the bell so softly that it only sounded a single full note and a
 small one; and
---
then he was informed.


---
that Mrs. Henchard was dead-- just
 dead-- that very hour
---
when he passed a few old
 inhabitants, who came there for water whenever they had, as at present,
 spare time to fetch it,
---
Mrs. Cuxsom,, was describing the incidents of
 Mrs. Henchard's death,.


---
But, that man, Christopher Coney, went and.'
---
,' he said,' why
 should death rob life o
---
,' says he.
---
" Gad, then I wo n't quite ha'e it
---
," said Solomon Longways.
---
" I say it
 to- day, and and
---
I would n't speak wrongfully for
 a zilver zixpence at such a time.
---
I do n't see noo harm in it.
---
I would n't sell skellintons-- leastwise
 respectable skellintons-- to be varnished for' natomies, except I were
 out o' work.
---
I say."


---
Henchard and Elizabeth sat.
---
after Mrs. Henchard's funeral, the candles were not lighted, and a
 restless, acrobatic flame, poised on a coal, called from the shady walls
 the smiles of all shapes that could respond-- the old pier- glass, with
 gilt columns and huge entablature, the picture- frames, sundry knobs and
 handles, and the brass rosette at the bottom of each riband bell- pull on
 either side of the chimney- piece
---
Henchard always looked like one bent on resisting pain."
---
when
 Elizabeth- Jane spoke of Richard Newson as" father
---
"" he said....
---
" Was Newson a kind father?"


---
Henchard's face settled into an expression of stolid loneliness which
 gradually modulated into something softer."
---
I had been your real
 father
---
Suppose?" he said.
---
" Would you have cared for me as much as you cared for
 Richard Newson?"


---
" I ca n't think it
---
It seemed to him
.

---
His mind began.
---
till he could no longer sit still
---
He
 walked up and down, and
---
then he came and.
---
He could no longer restrain his impulse.

---
he asked.


---
Elizabeth, it is I who am your father, and
 not Richard Newson.
---
Henchard went on:"
---
I'd rather
 have your scorn, your fear, anything than your ignorance;' tis that I
 hate!
---
-- Newson became her husband."


---
This was the nearest approach Henchard could make to the full truth.
---
As
 far as he personally was concerned he would have screened nothing
---
;
 but he showed a respect for the young girl's sex and years worthy of a
 better man.


---
When he had gone on
---
his story to be true
---
said Henchard, with vehement pathos,
---
" I ca n't
 bear it,
---
I wo n't bear it.
---
I am your father
---
Am I so
 dreadful, so hateful to' ee?
---
he cried,."
---
though I was a
 drinking man once, and
---
than HE was
---
I'll do anything,!"


---
if you will only look upon me as your
 father
---
" I do n't want
---
He went out at the door and, and
---
him go
 away into the garden
---
But he had not done.
---
, he reappeared.


---
No, Elizabeth, I do n't.
 I'll go away and and then
 I'll show' ee papers. There, I am gone, and I gave you your name" One word more, Elizabeth," he said.
---
I'll talk to my lawyer
---
-- I do n't know the law of it
 exactly; but
---
I must have it
---
", must n't I?
---
bending over the fender wrote at
 his dictation words which he had evidently got by heart from some
 advertisement or other-- words to the effect that she, the writer,
 hitherto known as Elizabeth- Jane Newson, was going to call herself
 Elizabeth- Jane Henchard forthwith.
---
" Now," said Henchard, with the blaze of satisfaction
---
that he always
 emitted--
---
when he had carried his point
---
But I wo n't trouble you with them till to- morrow.

---
He was gone.
---
Henchard in the meantime had gone upstairs.
---
Papers of a domestic nature
 he kept in a drawer in his bedroom, and
---
this he unlocked.
---
He was the kind of man to whom some
 human object for pouring out his heart upon--
---
The craving for his heart for the
 re- establishment of this tenderest human tie had been great during
 his wife's lifetime, and
---
now he had submitted to its mastery without
 reluctance and without fear.
---
He bent over the drawer again, and

---
the keys of which had been handed to him at her request
---
Here was
 the letter addressed to him with the restriction," NOT TO BE OPENED TILL
 ELIZABETH- JANE'S WEDDING- DAY."


---
Mrs. Henchard, though more patient than her husband, had been no
 practical hand at anything.
---
Henchard had no reason to suppose the restriction one of serious weight,
 and
---
his feeling for his late wife had not been of the nature of deep
 respect."
---
, I suppose,
---
without curiosity he allowed
---
his eyes to scan the letter:--



---
But, dear Michael done it for the best.
---
this living one is my other
 husband's.
---
Her husband regarded the paper.
---
which he saw for miles
---
His lips twitched, and
---
he seemed.
---
His usual habit was
---
whether
 destiny were hard upon him or not
---
-- the shape of his ideals in cases of
 affliction being simply a moody
---
what he had
 deserved
---
the girl's name altered from
 Newson to Henchard
---
His wife's extreme reluctance to have was now accounted for fully.
---
He remained unnerved and purposeless for near a couple of hours;
---
till he
 suddenly said,"!"


---
Ah-- I wonder
---
He jumped up in an impulse,.
---
where he put his ear to
 the keyhole and
---
Henchard softly
 turned the handle,,.
---
Gradually bringing the light from behind a screening curtain
 he held it in such a manner.
---
He steadfastly regarded her features.


---
: his were dark.
---
In sleep there come to the surface buried genealogical facts, ancestral
 curves, dead men's traits, which the mobility of daytime animation
 screens and overwhelms.
---
In the present statuesque repose of the young
 girl's countenance Richard Newson's was unmistakably reflected.
---
He could
 not endure the sight of her, and.


---
the first impulse for revenge died with the thought that
 she was beyond him.
---
He looked out at the night as at a fiend.
---
Henchard,
 like all his kind, was superstitious, and.
---
he could not help
---
was the
 scheme of some sinister intelligence bent on punishing him
---
If he had not revealed his past history to
 Elizabeth
---
he would not have searched the drawer for papers, and so on.

---
that he should have no sooner taught a girl
---
than he discovered her
---
This ironical sequence of things angered him like an impish trick from
 a fellow- creature.
---
Like Prester John's, his table had been spread, and

---
He went out of the house, and

---
till he came to the bridge at
 the bottom of the High Street
---
Here he turned in upon a bypath on the
 river bank,.


---
This missing feature, without
, was, in truth, the corpse of a
 man,.
---
where
 Henchard now walked
---
The exaggeration impressed Henchard more than he had expected.
---
The lugubrious harmony of
 the spot with his domestic situation was too perfect for him, impatient
 of effects scenes, and adumbrations.
---
It reduced his heartburning to
 melancholy, and
---
he exclaimed,"!"
---
He went
 on past the cottage in which the old local hangman had lived and died,
 in times.


---
For the sufferings of that night, engendered by his bitter
 disappointment
---
, he might well have been pitied.
---
He was like one who had
 and.
---
In words
 he could blame his wife, but not in his heart; and
---
had he obeyed the
 wise directions outside her letter this pain would have been spared him
 for long-- possibly for ever.


---
He was far too self- willed to recede from a position,
.
---
he had asserted

---
His daughter her to be, and
---
But he was ill- prepared for the first step in this new situation.
---
he came into the breakfast- room
---
" I have thought and
---
Newson--"( Henchard was glad that he had disguised matters
 here),
---
that is not the same thing as being one's real father after all.

---
he had

---
; yet it was no less than
 a miserable insipidity to him now.
---
His reinstation of
 her mother had been chiefly for the girl's sake, and
---
Of all the enigmas there can have been
 seldom one like that which followed Henchard's announcement of himself
 to Elizabeth as her father.
---
He had done it in an ardour and an agitation
 which had half carried the point of affection with her; yet, behold,
 from the next morning onwards his manner was constrained as she had
 never seen it before.


---
when he was rising from table,
---
'" he echoed sharply,"
---
where you are,' father
---
He made no reply, and.


---
Henchard, being uncultivated himself, was the bitterest critic the fair
 girl could possibly have had of her own lapses-- really slight now, for
 she read omnivorously.
---
It was not a man with whom he transacted business.


---
," he said,,
---
what I tell you--
---
I am a poor tool with a pen."


---
so be I
---
Henchard's creed was
---
ladies'-hand-- nay, he believed.
---
, he reddened
 in angry shame for her, and
---
as soon, Henchard broke
 out with," Good God
---
that he did not mean
---
But his passion had
 less terror for her than his coldness.
---
Not knowing his secret it was cruel mockery that she should
 for the first time excite his animosity when she had taken his surname.


---
Nance accepted this offering thankfully at first; afterwards
 as a matter of course.
---
when Henchard was on the premises he saw
 his step- daughter enter the hay- barn on this errand; and
---
On a day to work arranging two trusses of hay as a table, Mockridge meanwhile
 standing with her hands on her hips,.


---
said Henchard; and
---
" he said with suppressed
 passion."
---
Have n't I told you fifty times?
---
Now these words were uttered loud enough to reach Nance inside the barn
 door, who fired up immediately at the slur upon her personal character.

---
Come to that,
 Mr. Henchard
---
, I can let!"


---
," said Henchard
---
" Just ask her," said Nance,.


---
" he said to her.
---
Nance glanced triumphantly at Henchard, and.
---
Henchard, however, said nothing about
 discharging her.
---
Unduly sensitive on such points by reason of his
 own past, he had the look of one completely ground down to the last
 indignity.
---
though it had never before reached
 his own ears
---
Convinced of the scathing damage to his local repute and position, Henchard showed a positive distaste for the presence of
 this girl not his own,.
---
whenever he encountered her
---
He mostly dined with
 the farmers at the market- room of one of the two chief hotels,.
---
Could he have seen.
---
he might have found reason to reserve his judgment on
 her quality
---
If I am not
---
whenever he passed the house
---
as for the young
 man, he seldom or never turned his head
---
Mrs. Henchard's dust mingled with the dust of women
 who lay ornamented with glass hair- pins and amber necklaces, and men who
 held in their mouths coins of Hadrian, Posthumus, and the Constantines.


---
This figure, too, was reading; but not
 from a book: the words which engrossed it being the inscription on Mrs.
 Henchard's tombstone.
---
The stranger presently moved from the tombstone of Mrs. Henchard, and

---
Henchard,,
 had been made aware that he was not to be chosen to fill a vacancy in
 the list of aldermen; and
---
that Farfrae was likely to become one of the
 Council.
---
This caused the unfortunate discovery that she had played the
 waiting- maid in the town of which he was Mayor to rankle in his mind yet
 more poisonously.
---
He had learnt by personal inquiry at the time that
 it was to Donald Farfrae-- that treacherous upstart-- that she had thus
 humiliated herself.
---
that the simple thrifty deed was regarded as little less than a
 social catastrophe by him
---
which had changed his luck
---
That dinner at the
 King's Arms with his friends had been Henchard's Austerlitz
---
: he had had
 his successes since, but
---
his course had not been upward.
---
He was not
-- that Peerage of burghers-- as he had
 expected to be, and the consciousness of this soured him to- day.


---
he said to her with offhand laconism.


---
" I've been strolling in the Walks and churchyard, father,."
---
till I feel
 quite leery
---
This was just enough to incense Henchard after the other crosses of the
 day.
---
" I WON'T!"
---
he thundered."'
---
One day I learn.
---
Then I hear.
---
I'm

---
Meanwhile Henchard was sitting up,.
---
Farfrae to pay his addresses to this girl who did not belong
 to him,
---
when if he had allowed
---
he might not have been
 encumbered with her
---
At last he said to himself with satisfaction as

---
he jumped up and
---
he'll think
---
not that I do n't want my house to be
 troubled with her, and no portion at all!"
---
He wrote as follows:--


 Sir,--
---
On consideration, I do n't wish.
---
I therefore withdraw my objection;
.


---
He glanced up for a
 moment from a pocket- book in which he appeared to be making figures as
 he went;.


---
whether or not he saw her
---
he took no notice, and
---
he
 probably scorned her
---
Yes, I heard
 you
---
He is living?"


---
" Yes, he is living
---
" Is he not kind to you?"


---
" I've no wish to complain of him."

" There has been a disagreement?"


---
he
 was angry with me
---
That he is a
 hot- tempered man-- a little proud-- perhaps ambitious; but not a bad man."
 
---
Her anxiety not to condemn Henchard while siding with Elizabeth was
 curious.


---
And he has not even
 been unkind to me till lately--.
---
for then perhaps my father might
 get.
---
Wealth enjoys it" however vague his opinions of
 those accessories might be
---
Men had still quite recently been going in and out with parcels
 and packing- cases,.
---
till the intruder should have gone his ways
---
Henchard passed in, as ignorant of her presence.
---
Henchard's chiding, by begetting in her a nervous fear of doing anything
 definable as unladylike, had operated thus curiously in keeping them
 unknown to each other at a critical moment.
---
: What could he or she possibly be doing there?


---
whatever his business at the lady's house, reached his own
 home only a few minutes later than Elizabeth- Jane
---
Her plan was to
 broach the question of leaving his roof this evening
---
But its execution depended upon his
 mood, and
---
He showed no further tendency to be angry
---
; he
 showed something worse.
---
his coldness was such that it encouraged her to
 departure, even more than hot temper could have done.


---
rather I shall be living here after twelve o'clock
 to- day."

" I have been staying at Budmouth for a few days. I am going into though not all: I sleep there
 to- night for the first time" Father, have you any objection to my going away?"
---
He
 would know that soon enough.
---
After a pause he said,"?
---
"," he added after a pause.
---
what I should like
---
so that I may be independent of you.
---
" Then I'll see about it this very day."
---
He seemed relieved to get her
 off his hands by this arrangement, and as far as they were concerned the
 matter was settled.
---
" Your father is willing?"


---
" One is my father.
---
He rents that yard and barn."


---
Did you
 tell him
---
that he may
 alter his mind?"


---
He has grown quite cold to me."


---
Now Henchard had not the slightest suspicion that Elizabeth- Jane's
 movement was to be so prompt.
---
when, just before six, he
 reached home and, and
---
his
 step- daughter, with all her little bags and boxes, getting into it
---
Hence saw a fly at the door from the King's Arms, he
 was taken by surprise.


---
" Well, well, have your own way," he replied.
---
He entered the house, and,
.
---
He had never been there.

---
Henchard had known nothing of these
 efforts.
---
He gazed at them,.


---
," he said,
---
" Look here in an altered voice-- he never called her by
 name now--"don't
---
I've spoke roughly to
 you
---
I've been grieved beyond everything by you-- there's something
 that caused it."


---
He nodded ever so slightly, as a receipt of her decision and no more.

---
" Where?" said Henchard, his face stilling.


---
He neither moved nor.




22.



---
At the hour, he had
 been not a little amazed at receiving a letter by hand in Lucetta's
 well- known characters.
---
as I hope
---
that I have come
---
how long I
 can not tell
---
he is a man, and a merchant,
 and a Mayor, and one who has the first right to my affections.


---
Seriously, mon ami, I am not so light- hearted.
---
as I may seem
---
I have come here in consequence of hearing of the death of your
 wife-- whom you used to think of as dead so many years before!
---
I am glad you acted fairly by
 her.
---
as I knew
---
that I ought by asking you to carry out
 your promise to me.
---
I hope, and
---
As, however, I did not know, or
---
situated, I decided.


---
as I do about this
---
I shall be able to see you in a
 day or two.
---
I was unable to keep my appointment to meet you for a moment or
 two in passing through Casterbridge the other day.
---
Henchard had already heard.
---
He said with a puzzled air to the first person he encountered,
"?"


---
, I believe, sir,
---
" A lady of the name of Templeman" said his informant.


---
Henchard thought it over."
---
he said to himself
---
Yes, I must put her in her proper position,
 undoubtedly."


---
that he regarded the moral necessity now
---
His bitter disappointment at finding
 Elizabeth- Jane to be none of his, and
---
himself a childless man, had left
 an emotional void in Henchard that he unconsciously craved to fill.
---
In
 this frame of mind, though without strong feeling, he had strolled up
 the alley and into High- Place Hall by the postern at which Elizabeth
 had so nearly encountered him.
---
He had gone on thence into the court, and

---
whom he saw unpacking china from a crate
---
The man replied in the negative;.

---
Henchard went away,.


---
He was in this interested stage of the inquiry.
---
when he witnessed
 Elizabeth- Jane's departure the next day
---
On hearing her announce the
 address there suddenly took possession of him the strange thought that
 Lucetta and Miss Templeman were one and the same person, for he could
 recall that in her season of intimacy with him the name of the rich
 relative whom he had deemed somewhat a mythical personage had been given
 as Templeman.
---
Though he was not a fortune- hunter
---
He was getting on towards the dead
 level of middle age, when material things increasingly possess the mind.


---
But Henchard was not left long in suspense.
---
" I am in residence,.
---
which these announcements produced in Henchard's gloomy
 soul was to him most pleasurable
---
He sat over his dining- table long and
 dreamily, and by an almost mechanical transfer the sentiments which
 had run to waste since his estrangement from Elizabeth- Jane and Donald
 Farfrae gathered around Lucetta before they had grown dry.
---
who had given her time and her heart to him
 so thoughtlessly, at that former time,
---
On the
 whole he did not blame her.


---
he said,.


---
that he would like
---
He put on his hat and.
---
when he reached her door
---
The answer brought him; but
---
he thought.
---
he took
 the refusal quietly.
---
Nevertheless he resolved."
---
he said.


---
us follow the train of Mr. Henchard's thought, and
---
He was an officer in the army.
---
as he did not come
---
He moved about amid the throng, at
 this point lively as an ant- hill; elsewhere more reposeful, and broken
 up by stalls of fruit and vegetables.


---
Some men were well dressed; but
---
In fact, was ready money-- money insistently ready-- not ready next year like
 a nobleman's-- often not merely ready at the bank like a professional
 man's, but ready in their large plump hands.


---
that they were held by men from the cider- districts who came
 here to sell them, bringing the clay of their county on their boots
---
Henchard had come up,,"
---
I wonder accidentally encountering the young man, to inquire Do we speak to each other?"


---
her stepfather throw a shine into his eye which answered" No!"
 
---
Luckily Farfrae's figure was immediately covered by the apple- tree.


---
he's a wine merchant
---
Farfrae stood
 out quite distinctly now; but
---
Henchard had not called on Lucetta
---
though he had

---
He must have been too busy
---
He would come on
 Sunday or Monday.


---
But
 there remained a conscientious wish to bring about her union with him,
 now that there was nothing to hinder it-- to right her position-- which
 in itself was a happiness to sigh for.
---
your father may call
---
he stands close by in the market- place with the rest
 of the corn- dealers
---
He wo n't come."


---
" He has taken against me
---
he will avoid
---
-- his delays had wearied
 her, but
---
till a man's step was heard on the stairs
---
The man before
 her was not Henchard.




23.



---
He was years younger than the Mayor of Casterbridge; fair, fresh, and
 slenderly handsome.
---
He wore genteel cloth leggings with white buttons,
 polished boots with infinite lace holes, light cord breeches under a
 black velveteen coat and waistcoat; and
---
he had a silver- topped switch in
 his hand.
---
he said, in deprecating tones.
---
" I came and
---
I
 inquired for Miss Henchard, and!"


---
in no case
 would I have caught ye so unmannerly if I had known
---
" I was the unmannerly one
---
said Mr.
 Farfrae,.


---
Miss Henchard
 will be here directly."


---
which had awakened the interest of
 Henchard, and
---
that something about the young
 man-- that hyperborean crispness, stringency, and charm, as of a
 well- braced musical instrument, of Elizabeth- Jane and of the Three Mariners' jovial crew,
 at sight, made his unexpected presence here attractive to Lucetta.

---
He hesitated,.


---
Farfrae's sudden entry was simply the result of Henchard's permission to
 him to see Elizabeth if he were minded to woo her.
---
At first he had taken
 no notice of Henchard's brusque letter; but
---
an exceptionally fortunate
 business transaction put him on good terms with everybody, and.
---
that he could undeniably marry
---
if he chose
---
Apart from
 her personal recommendations a reconciliation with his former friend
 Henchard would, in the natural course of things, flow from such a union.

---
He therefore forgave the Mayor his curtness; and
---
this morning on his
 way to the fair he had called at her house, where he learnt that she
 was staying at Miss Templeman's.
---
He seemed in doubt, and
---
" he asked.


---
even if one does not want him
---
And I from near Edinboro'," he murmured.
---
a man must live.
---
where his money is made
---
O
 yes," he went on with ingenuous enthusiasm.
---
" You see that man with the
 drab kerseymere coat?
---
And then," cried Farfrae impetuously, his face alight,!
---
He was quite a new type
 of person to her.
---
he exclaimed.


---
It was now Farfrae who showed the modest pink.


---
he said simply.


---
" So do I-- as far as I can.
---
I seem hardly."


---
"," he murmured.
---
And his mind could be seen
.
---
that the curious double strands
 in Farfrae's thread of life-- the commercial and the romantic-- were very
 distinct at times
---
" Ah, no, ma'am," said Farfrae,.


---
Among the rest, at the corner of the pavement, stood an
 old shepherd, who attracted the eyes of Lucetta and Farfrae by his
 stillness.
---
He was evidently a chastened man.
---
The battle of life had been
 a sharp one with him, for,
---
to begin with, he was a man of small frame.

---
He was now.
---
that, approaching from
 behind, a person could hardly see his head
---
He had planted the stem of
 his crook in the gutter and.
---
which was by the long friction of his hands
---
He had quite

---
where he was
---
what he had come for.
---
, his eyes being bent
 on the ground
---
which
 had reference to him
---
he did not hear them, and
---
when his skill laid open to him any farm for the asking
---
The negotiations were between a farmer from a distant county and the old
 man's son.
---
in other words, the old man
 without the younger; and the son had a sweetheart on his present farm,

---
" I'm sorry to leave ye, Nelly
---
," said the young man with emotion."
---
But,
, I ca n't starve father, and
---
he's out o' work at Lady- day.'
---
I shall never see' ee again!"
---
-- I never shall
---
when he pressed her hand
---
he would give the young man half- an- hour for his answer, and
---
Lucetta's eyes, full of tears, met Farfrae's.
---
His, too, to her surprise,
 were moist at the scene.


---
," said Farfrae.
---
I want
 a young carter; and."


---
perhaps I'll take the old man too--
---
yes; he'll not be
 very expensive, and
---
doubtless he will answer my pairrpose somehow
---
Farfrae went out, and
---
him speak to the group
---
Farfrae returned to her

---
Farfrae looked more serious,.
---
"," he said.


---
I am a struggling hay- and- corn
 merchant."


---
" I am a very ambitious woman."


---
Ah, well, I cannet
---
I do n't know ambitious or no; and
---
how to talk to ladies,
," said Donald with grave regret.
---
" I try
!"


---
I see
---
Under this revelation of insight
 Farfrae again looked out of the window into the thick of the fair.


---
" Have you seen young Mr. Farfrae this morning?
---
He promised
; but
---
though he's mostly
 a man to his word
---
" murmured Farfrae.


---
" Yes," he replied.
---
But he still remained.


---
He looked anxiously at the farmer who was seeking him and who just then
 ominously walked across to where Henchard was standing, and
---
he looked
 into the room and at her.
---
" I like; but
---
I fear!"
---
I must go
---
he
 said.
---
I'll come another time--?"


---
if I may, ma'am
---
," said the Scotchman, with a
 simple, shamed, apologetic look for his weakness.
---
Dear me,
 I feel I have quite demoralized you!"

" But look or look not, I will see you in my thoughts. Well, I'll
 go" Maybe I'll get into my market- mind when I've been out a few minutes,"
  he murmured."
---
As he went
---
he said fervidly.


---
till he was

---
while he from merely affording her a new
 form of idleness, had gone on
---
capped by her indiscretions with Henchard
---
Farfrae was shown out,.
---
it having entirely escaped him
---
that he had called

---
him threading the maze
 of farmers and farmers' men
---
that he
 was conscious of her eyes
---
her heart went out to him for his
 modesty--.
---
that he might be
 allowed
---
He entered the market- house, and
---
he's afraid he has n't much time to

---
spare, he says.
---
Henchard had neglected her all these days, after
 compromising her indescribably in the past.
---
The least he could have done
,.


---
when he found himself free, and herself affluent
---
His face, for, either
 through shyness, or not to disturb his mercantile mood, he avoided
.


---
Donald Farfrae was in the minds of both as the innovator, for though.
---
he was
---
as if
 in response to their thought he came up at that moment
---
as if he knew something about
 its make
---
The two watchers had inwardly started at his coming, and

---
His greeting had been somewhat dry and thunderous, and
---
" This is the
 lady I live with, father-- Miss Templeman."


---
Henchard put his hand to his hat, which he brought down with a great
 wave till it met his body at the knee.
---
" Yes," Henchard replied; and
---
he proceeded, and.


---
" Oh, do n't ask me, ma'am!" said Henchard.
---
Twas brought here by one of our machinists on
 the recommendation of a jumped- up jackanapes of a fellow who thinks----"
  His eye caught Elizabeth- Jane's imploring face, and
---
he stopped, probably
.


---
He turned.
---
which his
 stepdaughter fancied
---
A murmur
 apparently came from Henchard's lips in which she detected the words,
" You refused to see me!"
---
Henchard had by this time

---
They could see behind it the bent back of a man who was
 pushing his head into the internal works to master their simple secrets.

---
Satisfied at last with his investigation the young man stood upright,
 and.


---
O no!" said Farfrae gravely.
---
" Then the romance of the sower is gone for good," observed
 Elizabeth- Jane, who felt herself at one with Farfrae in Bible- reading
 at least."'
---
He shall not sow,'
---
his words will not be to the point any more.
---
Donald admitted,."
---
his gaze fixing itself on a
 blank point far away
---
," he added apologetically.


---
," said he,
---
he was quite at his ease.

---
I merely recommended."


---
which followed Farfrae
---
that he was much
 mixed that day
---
Your father was distant with you
---
because he does not think
---
My mother's separation from my father was unfortunate for me.
---
For one thing Henchard had never
 returned to her the cloud of letters she had written and sent him in
 her first excitement.
---
The rencounter with Farfrae and his bearings towards Lucetta had made
 the reflective Elizabeth more observant of her brilliant and amiable
 companion.
---
him wear his special
 look
---
" You've seen Mr. Farfrae
---
what he had said
---
" This person-- a lady-- once admired a man much-- very much
---
He did not think so deeply of her.
---
But in an impulsive moment, purely out of reparation, he
 proposed.
---
that he could
 not altogether be blamed for what had happened
---
he came."


---
that he
 was not, and
---
The next phase of the supersession of Henchard in Lucetta's heart was
 an experiment in calling on her performed by Farfrae with some apparent
 trepidation.
---
Conventionally speaking he conversed with both Miss
 Templeman and her companion; but
---
Donald appeared, and

---
Susan Henchard's daughter bore up against the frosty ache of the
 treatment,.

---
The Scotchman seemed hardly the same Farfrae who had danced with her and
 walked with her in a delicate poise between love and friendship-- that
 period in the history of a love when alone it can be said to be
 unalloyed with pain.


---
" HE is
 the second man of that story she told me
---
All this time Henchard's smouldering sentiments towards Lucetta had been
 fanned into higher and higher inflammation by the circumstances of the
 case.
---
He was discovering.
---
for whom he once felt a
 pitying warmth which had been almost chilled out of him by reflection
---
proved to him, by her silence, that it was no use to think of bringing
 her round by holding aloof
---
Day after day
; so he gave in, and.


---
He crossed the room to her with a heavy tread of some awkwardness, his
 strong, warm gaze upon her-- like the sun beside the moon in comparison
 with Farfrae's modest look-- and with something of a hail- fellow bearing,
 as,
---
that he became deferential, and
---
He understood but little of fashion in dress, yet enough
 to feel himself inadequate in appearance beside her whom he had hitherto
 been dreaming of as almost his property.
---
him to recover balance
---
He looked her oddly in the face,.


---
," he said.
---
I could n't have helped myself
---
if I had

---
if I had any kindness at all
---
I've called
---
that
 I am ready, as soon as custom will permit,
---
His voice slowly fell
---
; he was conscious
.
---
that in this room his accents and manner wore a roughness not observable
 in the street
---
He looked about the room at the novel hangings and
 ingenious furniture with which she had surrounded herself.


---
," he said.


---
he did not furnish one."
---
Well," he
 went on,"
---
He turned to her with congratulatory admiration so
 fervid that she shrank somewhat, notwithstanding that she knew him so
 well.


---
Henchard showed chagrin at once
---
-- nobody was more quick to show that than
 he.


---
"," he said.
---
I am English!"


---
he said nothing to fill the gap for
 awhile,.


---
he said at last grimly,.


---
It was produced by the passing of a load of newly trussed hay from the
 country, in a waggon marked with Farfrae's name.
---
Beside it rode Farfrae
 himself on horseback.
---
when the man rises upon her gaze like an apparition
---
But Henchard in
 estimating.


---
" I should n't have thought it--
---
I should n't have thought it of women!"
---
he
 said emphatically by- and- by,;
.
---
He would not take it."
---
," he said drily, and
.
---
At going out he turned his eye upon her.


---
to live in Casterbridge entirely on my account," he said.
---
He had hardly gone down the staircase.
---
" I WILL love him!"
---
as for HIM-- he's, and
---
I wo n't be a slave to the
 past--
---
where I choose
---
Yet having decided to break away from Henchard one might have supposed
 her capable of aiming higher than Farfrae.
---
that her father,, and Donald Farfrae became
 every day
---
On Farfrae's side
 it was the unforced passion of youth.
---
But, as regarded Henchard, this perception of hers also caused her
 some filial grief
---
he had made
---
what unwished- for
 thing Heaven might send her in place of him
---
that on a fine spring morning Henchard and Farfrae met in the
 chestnut- walk
---
Each had just
 come out from his early breakfast, and
---
Henchard was reading a letter from Lucetta, sent in answer to a note
 from him, in which she made some excuse for not immediately granting him
 a second interview that he had desired.


---
Donald had no wish to enter into conversation with his former friend on
 their present constrained terms
---
; neither would he pass him in scowling
 silence.
---
He nodded, and
---
Henchard did the same.
---
when a voice cried" Farfrae
---
It was Henchard's, who
 stood regarding him.


---
," said Henchard,?"


---
as if it were the presence of the
 thought and not of the man which made him speak
---
I do
---
"," said Farfrae.


---
" Well, I have offered; but
---
that I can
---
-- I put it to you?"


---
," said Farfrae heartily.


---
"," said Henchard, and.


---
That he had looked up from a letter.
---
Indeed,
 her present position was so different from that of the young woman of
 Henchard's story as of itself.
---
As for Henchard, he was reassured by Farfrae's words
 and manner against a suspicion which had crossed his mind.
---
Yet that there was rivalry by some one he was firmly persuaded.
---
He could
 feel it in the air around Lucetta,.
---
when he had tried to

---
so that hang near her he seemed
---
he was more and more certain
---
if they did not want him
---
another's-- he exerted
 himself to the utmost; and
---
At the interview,, he made it a point to launch
 a cautious inquiry.


---
We both know him
---
-- somebody between gentle
 and simple," said the corn- merchant to himself.
---
therefore if it is he
---
In a few seconds surely enough Donald walked in.


---
He was well- nigh ferocious at the sense of the queer
 situation in which he stood towards this woman.
---
who had reproached
 him for deserting her when calumniated
---
who had urged claims upon his
 consideration on that account, who had lived waiting for him,
---
And now he sat at her tea- table eager to gain her
 attention, and
---
Henchard took a
 slice by one end and Donald by the other
---
certain he was

---
; the man meant;
---
Farfrae tried
; but
---
he was too much in love
---
Henchard left the house with a ton of conjecture, though without a grain
 of proof,.
---
that the counterattraction was Farfrae; and
---
therefore he
 would not make up his mind
---
Yet to Elizabeth- Jane it was plain as the
 town- pump that Donald and Lucetta were incipient lovers.
---
But
 Henchard was constructed upon too large a scale as these by an evening light, which to him were as the notes of an
 insect that lie above the compass of the human ear.


---
But he was.
---
The thus vitalized antagonism took the form of action by Henchard
 sending for Jopp, the manager originally displaced by Farfrae's arrival.

---
Henchard had frequently met this man about the streets,.


---
that
 his clothing spoke of neediness,
---
that he lived in Mixen
 Lane-- a back slum of the town, the pis aller of Casterbridge
 domiciliation-- itself almost a proof that a man had reached a stage when
 he would not stick at trifles
---
Jopp came after dark, by the gates of the storeyard, and.


---
where Henchard sat in solitude

---
Jopp named his price, which was very moderate.


---
" At this hour and moment, sir," said Jopp, who, standing hands- pocketed
 at the street corner till the sun had faded the shoulders of his coat
 to scarecrow green,
---
which the still
 man has in his stillness of knowing the busy one better than he knows
 himself
---
Jopp too, had had a convenient experience
---
; he was the only one
 in Casterbridge besides Henchard and the close- lipped Elizabeth who knew
 that Lucetta came truly from Jersey, and but proximately from Bath."
---
I
 know Jersey too, sir
---
," he said.
---
possibly did not occur
 to Henchard.
---
Jopp said,".


---
that at last he officially belonged to that spot
---
" Now," said Henchard,.
---
" I've seen it all
---
," said Jopp.

" By fair competition I mean.
---
, of course," Henchard continued
---
I've capital, mind ye,
---
and I can do it.
---
" I'm all that way of thinking
---
who had once ursurped his place
---
while it made him
 a willing tool
---
Jopp's dislike of
 Farfrae as the man,, made him, at the same time, commercially as unsafe a
 colleague as Henchard could have chosen.


---
" I sometimes think," he added,".
---
that he must have some glass that he
 sees next year in
---
He has such a knack of making everything bring him
 fortune."


---
" He's deep beyond all honest men's discerning, but
---
we must make him
 shallower.
---
We'll undersell him, and."


---
that Jopp had been engaged by her
 stepfather
---
Henchard shut up her argument with a sharp rebuff.


---
The farmer's income was ruled by the wheat- crop within his own horizon,
 and the wheat- crop by the weather.
---
Thus in person, he became a sort of
 flesh- barometer, with feelers always directed to the sky and wind around
 him.
---
The local atmosphere was everything to him; the atmospheres of
 other countries a matter of indifference.
---
as men waiting in
 antechambers watch the lackey
---
backed by Jopp
---
Henchard,, read a disastrous garnering, and.
---
But before acting
 he wished--.
---
that he could know for certain
---
He was superstitious---- and
---
he nourished in his mind an idea
 bearing on the matter; an idea he shrank from disclosing even to Jopp.


---
In a lonely hamlet a few miles from the town-- so lonely-- there lived a man of
 curious repute as a forecaster or weather- prophet.
---
The way to his house
 was crooked and miry-- even difficult in the present unpropitious season.

---
when it was raining so heavily that ivy and laurel resounded
 like distant musketry, and an out- door man could be excused for
 shrouding himself to his ears and eyes,
---
till at length he reached the house, which, with its garden, was
 surrounded with a high, dense hedge
---
thatched
 also by himself
---
Here he had always lived, and
---
he
 would die
---
He existed on unseen supplies
---
; for it was an anomalous thing that while
 there was hardly a soul in the neighbourhood but affected to laugh at
 this man's assertions, uttering the formula
---
Whenever they consulted him
---
When they paid him
---
He would have preferred more honesty in his clients, and less sham
 ridicule; but fundamental belief consoled him for superficial irony.
---
As
 stated, he was enabled
---
to live; people supported him with their backs
.
---
He was sometimes astonished.


---
that men could profess so little and

---
Behind his back he was called" Wide- oh," on account of his reputation
---
The hedge of his garden formed an arch over the entrance, and
---
as if he were suffering from
 toothache
---
he could see the prophet within,.


---
He placed
 the candle on the corner of the dresser,.


---
as he could
---
He threw the door and.


---
as he had declared
---
Henchard felt like Saul at his reception by Samuel
---
; he remained in
 silence for a few moments, then
---
which he had hitherto preserved
---
he said,"....
---
Then I have not come in
 vain
---
" That I've done-- with consideration--."


---
Feeling you'd come I've waited for' ee;
 and I laid two supper
 plates--."" Then take this," said Henchard."
---
When can I know?'


---
" I've worked it out already, and
---
Shall I sketch it out for
' ee in a scheme?"


---
" O no, no," said Henchard.
---
" I do n't altogether believe in forecasts,
.
---
Henchard would gladly have joined;
---
that the meat, the onions, the pepper, and the herbs could
 be severally recognized by his nose
---
to mark him too implicitly as the
 weather- caster's apostle, he declined, and.


---
The next Saturday Henchard bought grain to such an enormous extent that
 there was quite a talk about his purchases among his neighbours the
 lawyer, the wine merchant, and the doctor; also on the next, and on
 all available days.
---
When his granaries were full to choking all the
 weather- cocks of Casterbridge
---
He was reminded of what he had well known
 before,.


---
that a man might gamble upon the square green areas of fields as
 readily as upon those of a card- room
---
Henchard had backed bad weather, and.
---
He had.
---
His dealings had been so
 extensive that settlement could not long be postponed, and to settle he
.
---
that he had bought only a few weeks before
 at figures higher by many shillings a quarter
---
he had

---
Thus he lost heavily.


---
In the blaze of an early August day he met Farfrae in the market- place.

---
Farfrae knew of his dealings(;.

---
though he did not guess their intended
 bearing on himself) and
---
Henchard for the moment appeared; but
---
he suddenly
 took a careless turn.


---
" Ho, no, no!--nothing serious, man!"
---
he cried with fierce gaiety."
---
I know; but
---
And dammy, a man must be a fool to mind
 the common hazards of trade!"


---
But he had.
---
which
 had never before sent him there-- and
---
It was rumoured soon after that much
 real property as well as vast stores of produce, which had stood
 in Henchard's name in the town and neighbourhood,.


---
he encountered Jopp
---
Henchard fancied
---
so that Jopp met with anything but a bland reception
---
The latter was in the act of taking off his hat to wipe his forehead,
 and.


---
Henchard continued his address to Jopp in similar terms till it
 ended in Jopp's dismissal there and then, Henchard turning upon his heel
 and leaving him.


---
" You shall be sorry for this, sir; sorry as a man can be!
---
" said Jopp,
 standing pale, and.




27.



---
as he disappeared in

---
Prices being low Farfrae
---
So he went on buying old corn at its
 comparatively ridiculous price:.


---
When Henchard had squared his affairs in a disastrous way, and
---
got rid
 of his burdensome purchases at a monstrous loss, the harvest began.

---
said Henchard.


---
If Henchard had only waited long
 enough
---
he might at least have avoided loss.
---
though he had not made a
 profit
---
But the momentum of his character knew no patience.
---
At this turn
 of the scales he remained silent.
---
The movements of his mind seemed.


---
that some power was working against him
---
I wonder
---
"," he asked himself with eerie misgiving;"!
---
I wonder
---
I do n't believe in such power; and
---
Even he could not admit.
---
that
 the perpetrator, if any, might be Farfrae
---
These isolated hours of
 superstition came to Henchard in time of moody depression,.


---
when all his
 practical largeness of view had oozed out of him
---
Meanwhile Donald Farfrae prospered.
---
He had purchased in so depressed a
 market that the present moderate stiffness of prices was sufficient to
 pile for him a large heap of gold where a little one had been.


---
" Why, he'll soon be Mayor!"
---
said Henchard.
---
The rivalry of the masters was taken up by the men.


---
said Farfrae's waggoner.
---
that
 Henchard's man was most in the wrong
---
, he therefore attempted.
---
the two men closed in

---
Before the first round was quite over Henchard
.


---
somebody having run for him
---
Henchard sent the two men staggering in contrary directions by collaring
 one with each hand,.
---
He then inquired into the circumstances; and

---
seeing the state of his waggon and its load began.


---
repassed by the forms of Henchard and the
 waggoners
---
your man was most in the
 wrong!"


---
Henchard paused in his harangue and."
---
Oh, I did n't notice you,
 Miss Templeman," said he.
---
But I beg your pardon notwithstanding.
---
he must have been most."


---
" No; I saw it, too
---
he
 could n't help it
---
that he is
---
that I pay my attentions to her, and I know nothing, sir, outside eight shillings a week." And that Mr. Farfrae is well aware of it?
---
He's sharp in trade, but
---
he
 would n't do anything as what you hint at."


---
before
 Henchard could reach it
---
This disappointed
 him,.
---
for he had been sufficiently disturbed by what the man had said to
 wish to speak to her more closely
---
The Mayor's out o' town, is n't he?"


---
" He is, sir."


---
During those moments Henchard had determined, and
---
he knocked for admission.


---
he received
---
The answer was an expression of Miss Templeman's sorrow at
 being unable to see him again that evening because she had an engagement
 to go out.


---
Henchard walked away from the door to the opposite side of the street,
 and.
---
stood by his hay in a lonely reverie,
---
he entered the shadow of one of
 the projecting jambs which formed the thoroughfare to Bull Stake
---
; here
 he watched Lucetta's door.


---
almost at the moment Farfrae came round the opposite
 corner and
---
he determined
---
Their shouts and laughter had reached Henchard
 at the Market House,
---
while he stood there, and
---
he had little
 doubt from the turn which Farfrae and Lucetta had taken that they were
 bound for the spot.


---
Reaching the top of the lane Henchard crossed the shaded avenue on the
 walls,.
---
He had entered at a point removed from the scene of immediate
 operations; but
---
he could
 see.
---
They were paying no regard to the
 direction of their walk, whose vague serpentining soon began to
 bear down towards Henchard.
---
he
 therefore stepped into the hollow of the nearest shock, and.


---
" Well, then," replied Farfrae, with the unmistakable inflection of the
 lover pure, which Henchard had never heard in full resonance of his lips
 before,
---
he the speaker?" said she,."
---
" Ah! I'm afraid that what I feel will make me forget my manners!"


---
" Then I hope, cause."
---
which Henchard lost
---
Farfrae seemed.


---
that he would not
---
" convinced,, that I love nobody else
---
Henchard did not hear the reply
---
; he might have done so and much more,
 but
---
he did not care.
---
He had some business with them, and,
---
though he entreated
 her
---
Henchard thereupon left the field and.
---
His state of mind
 was such that on reaching Lucetta's door
---
he did not knock but.
---
he perceived.
---
he had

---
He had.
---
for he soon heard,
---
The light was so low that she did not notice Henchard at first.
---
as he, standing close to the edge of her gown
---
to hear it," said he.


---
that I gained with such sorrow
---
Had I found.
---
I might have felt now
---
But I soon learnt.
---
because I had nursed you, and, and
---
After that I did not care for you so deeply as
 before."


---
" I thought, even though I-- did not like you so well."


---
I ought
---
that having discovered Henchard's infirmities of temper
---
I was a poor girl
 then; and
---
I am hardly the same
 person."


---
But I do n't want.
---
I am quite willing that every penny of your property
 shall remain to your personal use.
---
The man is no better than I."


---
If you were as good as he you would leave me
---
This unluckily aroused Henchard.
---
" You can not in honour refuse me," he
 said.
---
" And to be my
 wife, before a witness, I'll reveal our intimacy-- in common fairness to
 other men!"


---
Henchard saw its bitterness;
 and.
---
Lucetta's heart been given to any other man in the world than
 Farfrae he would probably have had pity upon her at that moment
---
as Henchard called him)
---
who had mounted into
 prominence upon his shoulders
---
he could bring himself.


---
," he said,,"
---
", I must agree!"


---
" I do."


---
I have lived with her, and."


---
This promise will
 leave him free for you,
---
if you want him
---
," said Henchard."
---
I do n't wish to,
---
"," said Henchard
---
I have, I have
---
I will not
---
"," he said.
---
And taking up his hat he went away.


---
" You called my father' Michael'?
---
as if you knew him well
---
he has got this power over you,?
---
that the secret of
 Elizabeth's heart concerned the young man who had caused this damage to
 her own
---
how my father can command you so
---
The next morning Henchard went to the Town Hall below Lucetta's house,
,.
---
In passing he looked up at her
 windows, but
---
Henchard as a Justice of the Peace may at first seem.
---
But his rough
 and ready perceptions, his sledge- hammer directness, had often served
 him better than nice legal knowledge in despatching such simple business
.
---
his eyes
 still abstractedly stretching out of the window to the ashlar front of
 High- Place Hall
---
the offender stood before him.
---
Henchard
 looked at her, with a momentary pause,."
---
" he said,
.


---
" Stand back then," said Henchard," and.
---
, the magistrate's clerk dipped his pen,, and
---
Henchard
 being
---
I went down the street at twenty- five minutes
 past eleven P.M. on the night of the fifth instinct, Hannah Dominy.
---
When
 I had--


---
The constable waited, with his eyes on the clerk's pen,."
---
He paused,.


---
; for having got his evidence by heart it was immaterial to him
 whereabouts he broke off.


---
that twelve feet nine inches from a man on his oath was
 admissible
---
However, Henchard broke out impatiently,!
---
the clerk dipped his
 pen.


---
But Henchard stared, and
---
" A man and a woman with a little child came into my tent,
---
then he had more and more;.
---
till at last he quarrelled with his wife, and

---
who sold his
 wife in that fashion
---
I
 was of a more respectable station in the world then than I am now,; and I used. I did it for the man; and
 And the man is the man sitting there in the great big chair."
 
---
The speaker concluded by nodding her head at Henchard and folding her
 arms.


---
Everybody looked at Henchard.
---
His face seemed strange, and
---
that he's no better than I
---
The words came from Henchard."'
---
Tis as true as the
 light," he said slowly."
---
that I'm no
 better than she
---
And to keep out of any temptation to treat her hard for
 her revenge, I'll leave her to you."


---
Henchard left the
 chair, and
---
which Henchard had given her of the separation from
 his wife Susan for so many years
---
In all the accounts, of his belief in her death, and so on,
 he had never clearly explained the actual and immediate cause of that
 separation.
---
At bottom, then, Henchard was this.

---
who should commit herself to his
 care
---
After two or three days of solitude and
 incessant rain Henchard called at the house.
---
He seemed disappointed to
 hear of Lucetta's absence and
---
though he nodded with outward indifference

---
he went away.


---
The next day he called again.
---
" he asked.


---
," replied his stepdaughter."
---
After a few words, to reveal his restless impatience,
 he left the house again.

---
that he would be home
---
who, facing the other way, did
 not observe him
---
Nothing was commoner than for a house- holder on going out of his
 parlour to find his hall or passage full of little children, nursemaids,
 aged women, or a ladies' school, who apologized for their presence by
 saying," A bull passing down street from the sale."


---
, he meanwhile drawing
 vaguely towards them.
---
though disfigured at present by splotches of mud about
 his seamy sides
---
His horns were thick and tipped with brass; his two
 nostrils like the Thames Tunnel as seen in the perspective toys of yore.

---
which the bull with the motions
 of his head flung about like a flail
---
by which the drover controlled him and
---
as they had kept their eyes on the bull he had

---
than he tossed his head and
---
the bull scampering
 through the pond without, and in a second he dashed into the barn,
 knocking down the hurdle- stake in passing
---
; the heavy door slammed behind
 him; and
---
By the time that his length would allow
---
him to turn and
---
follow them
 thither; thus the pursuit went on, the hot air
 from his nostrils blowing over them like a sirocco, and not a moment
 being attainable by Elizabeth or Lucetta in which to open the door.
---
a man appeared.
---
He ran forward towards the leading- staff,
.

---
as if he would snap it off
---
The man was seen in the partial gloom.
---
He led the bull to the door, and
---
the light revealed
 Henchard.
---
He made the bull fast without, and
---
re- entered to the succour
 of Lucetta; for he had not perceived Elizabeth, who had climbed on to
 the clover- heap.
---
Henchard took her in his
 arms and.


---
," he responded tenderly.
---
Henchard had secured him by
.
---
His presence here seemed.
---
Donald saw
 her,.
---
At
, he
 exhibited an agitation different in kind no less than in intensity
 from any she had seen in him before.
---
He became.


---
that he scarcely had sufficient knowledge of what he was
 doing to think of helping her up beside him
---
" I do n't mind it at all, as I am
 not tired as you are."" he inquired at last.


---
He is taking her home.
---
Farfrae checked his horse's pace
---
He was thinking.
---
Henchard
 had saved Lucetta, and
---
to provoke a possible exhibition of her deeper
 affection for himself was as ungenerous as it was unwise.


---
Farfrae did not whip on the
 horse.
---
the town walls Henchard and his companion
 had disappeared down the street; Farfrae set down Elizabeth- Jane on her
 and.


---
On this account he entered the house through his garden, and
---
his apartments found them in a particularly disturbed state, his boxes
 being hauled out upon the landing, and his bookcase standing in three
 pieces.
---
"" he said to the mistress of
 the house, who was superintending.


---
" I am afraid not before eight, sir
---
" A-- well, never mind, never mind!" said Farfrae cheerily.
---
, I doubt
---
Thus speaking he went out by
 the front door and up the street.


---
During this interval Henchard and Lucetta had had experiences of
 a different kind.
---
the
 corn- merchant opened himself frankly,
---
Dear Lucetta, I have been
 very, very anxious to see you these two or three days
---
," he said,"!
---
ever
 since I saw you last
---
I have thought over the way I got your promise
 that night.
---
Henchard remained in thought.
---
He had evidently not expected this."
---
If I were a man I should not insist I felt. I do n't want to
; and Therefore I agree to an indefinite
 engagement--."

" But-- but-- can I do nothing of a different kind?" There
 is one thing, Lucetta," he said.
---
" No, no!" said Henchard, almost in anger.
---
" I'm not the man to sponge on
 a woman,.
---
My great creditor is
 Grower, and
---
it is at his hands.
---
I shall suffer
---
if at anybody's; while a
 fortnight's forbearance on his part would be enough to allow me to pull
 through
---
This may be got out of him in one way--
---
him have
 this story, without, of course, any prejudice to the fact that the
 actual engagement between us is to be a long one
---
you could go with me to Mr. Grower and
---
me speak to' ee before
 him
---
We'll ask him.
---
He
 will willingly wait then.
---
At the fortnight's end I shall be able to face
 him; and
---
I can coolly tell him.
---
It being now, that
 is, the quarter- hour just before dusk, he did not at first observe the
 result of his own words upon her.


---
he said, with a deep reproach."
---
I could have told him as much myself, but
---
he would not have

---
because I won't
---
because I absolutely ca n't
---
he burst out.
---
"

" Because-- he was a witness!"


---
Grower was!"


---
Mr. Grower was a witness."


---
because he happened
---
Henchard stood.
---
" Married him?" said Henchard at length.
---
" My good-- what, married him
 whilst-- bound?"


---
I loved him so much, and
---
I thought
!
---
you might tell him of the past-- and
---
when I
 had promised you
---
And then,, I learnt of the rumour that you had--
---
How could I keep my promise after
 hearing that?
---
I could not risk myself in your hands
---
But I knew.
---
I
 should lose Donald--
---
if I did not secure him at once
---
for you would carry
 out your threat of telling him of our former acquaintance,
---
while he spoke
---
I suppose?
---
" said
 he.


---
" Yes-- I think, or
---
he has told them
---
else Mr. Grower has....
---
May I leave
 you now?
---
My-- he was detained at Port- Bredy to- day, and."


---
" Then it is HIS WIFE'S life."


---
I have saved this afternoon
---
" Yes-- and he will be for ever grateful to you."


---
" I am....
---
I did not know all your
 past----"

"
---
And now I've a mind to punish you as you deserve!
---
One word to this
 bran- new husband of, and your precious happiness is
 blown to atoms!"


---
" I'll help you."


---
I
 shall say something worse.
---
Farfrae's words to his landlady had referred to the removal of his boxes
 and other effects from his late lodgings to Lucetta's house.
---
At the last moment of leaving Port- Bredy, Farfrae, like John Gilpin,
 had been detained by important customers, whom, even in the exceptional
 circumstances, he was not the man to neglect.
---
He
 had, therefore, sent on his two- days' bride in a hired brougham,.
---
whilst
 he went across the country to a certain group of wheat and barley ricks
 a few miles off,
---
at which he might be expected

---
This accounted for her trotting out to meet him after
 their separation of four hours.


---
when he came on from his
 lodgings
---
Half- an- hour after her arrival he
 walked in, and
---
" he said thoughtfully.
---
" I gave her a lift from
 the barn homewards; but
---
I did not tell her either;."


---
for I thought

---
But I'll find out
---
; I'll go to her
 now.
---
I do n't
---
" O no, indeed," Farfrae answered with, perhaps, a faint
 awkwardness."
---
But I wonder?"


---
Farfrae looked at her and.
---
He liked her all the better for the blindness.

---
" Arrange," he said.
---
" I'll run and
---
He was a widower,.
---
as he supposed
---
He had not
 heard of his first wife for many years.
---
as I may say the husband comes again,.'
---
But, Elizabeth- Jane,
 all this amounts to a new courtship of me by him;
---
when any one gets coupled up with a man in the
 past so unfortunately as you have done
---
He turned out
---
who the man is
---
it is him or nobody for you
---
" Why, you HAVE married him!"
---
He did treat my mother badly once.
---
that he is stern sometimes
---
But you
 will rule him entirely
---
" You-- have-- married Mr. Farfrae!"
---
" My husband is
 downstairs.
---
He will live here; and
---
Now the instant decision of Susan Henchard's daughter was.
---
Apart from her estimate of the propriety of
 Lucetta's conduct, Farfrae had been so nearly her avowed lover that she
 felt she could not abide there.


---
who
 was closely shut up in the drawing- room with Farfrae
---
then
 Elizabeth- Jane called a man with a wheel- barrow; and
---
They were in
 the street in which Henchard lived, and almost opposite his door.


---
acquired in
 childhood by making seines in Newson's home
---
Whether Farfrae
 would sell his business and,
 or
---
whether he would show independence enough to stick to his trade in
 spite of his brilliant alliance
---
set up for a gentleman on his wife's money, was a great point of interest.




31.



---
The retort of the furmity- woman; and
 in four- and- twenty hours there was not a person in Casterbridge
 who remained unacquainted with the story of Henchard's mad freak at
 Weydon- Priors Fair, long years before.
---
he had made in
---
Had
 well known of old and always have grown, but
 well- nigh the single one, of a young man with whom the steady and mature
( if somewhat headstrong) burgher of to- day had scarcely a point in
 common.
---
the black spot of his youth
 wore the aspect of a recent crime.


---
On that day-- almost
 at that minute-- he passed the ridge of prosperity and honour, and.
---
how soon he sank
 in esteem
---
Socially he had received a startling fillip downwards; and,
, the
 velocity of his descent in both aspects became accelerated every hour.


---
He now gazed more at the pavements and less at the house- fronts; more at the feet and leggings of men, and less into the
 pupils of their eyes with the blazing regard which formerly had made
 them blink.


---
when he
 walked about
---
It had been a bad year for others
 besides himself, and
---
whom he had trusted

---
the heavy failure of a debtor generously completed the overthrow of his tottering credit.
---
And now,
 in his desperation, he failed.
---
For
 this, one of his men was mainly; that worthy, in his great
 unwisdom, having picked over the sample of an enormous quantity of
 second- rate corn which Henchard had in hand, and removed the pinched,
 blasted, and smutted grains in great numbers.
---
the blunder of
 misrepresentation, coming at such a moment, dragged Henchard's name into
 the ditch.


---
The details of his failure were of the ordinary kind.
---
that it was a meeting
 of the Commissioners under Mr. Henchard's bankruptcy
---
that he was present in the hotel she wished

---
Henchard, looking out of the window, had caught sight of
 Elizabeth- Jane through the wire blind.
---
His examination had closed, and

---
The appearance of Elizabeth threw him into a
 reverie, till,
---
turning his face from the window, and towering above all
 the rest, he called their attention for a moment more.
---
His countenance
 had somewhat changed from its flush of prosperity
---
," he said,"
---
I do n't wish to

---
keep it from you, not I." Saying this, he took his gold watch from
 his pocket and; then his purse-- the yellow canvas
 moneybag, such as was carried by all farmers and dealers-- untying it,
 and shaking the money out upon the table beside the watch.
---
The latter
 he drew back quickly for an instant,."
---
given him by Lucetta
---
,"
  he said.
---
" And I wish for your sakes' twas more."


---
The creditors, farmers almost to a man, looked at the watch, and at the
 money, and into the street;.


---
" No, no, Henchard," he said warmly.
---
" Ay, sure:," said Grower, another creditor.


---
him keep it, of course
---
than he cared
---
he turned aside to the window again.
---
though the
 case is a desperate one, I am bound that I have never met a
 debtor who behaved more fairly I've proved as I can see
 Henchard regarded the watch they had returned to him."
---
' Tisn't
 mine by rights," he said to himself.
---
I do n't want!"
---
Moved by a recollection he
 took the watch to the maker's just opposite, sold it there and then for
 what the tradesman offered, and went with the proceeds to one among
 the smaller of his creditors, a cottager of Durnover in straitened
 circumstances, to whom he handed the money.


---
that Henchard had owned, and
---
, there was quite a sympathetic reaction in the town,
 which till then for some time past had done nothing but condemn him.
---
Now
 that Henchard's whole career was pictured distinctly to his neighbours,
 and
---
how admirably he had used his one talent of energy

---
which
 was really all he could show
---
when he came to the town as a journeyman
 hay- trusser, with his wimble and knife in his basket
---
; he did not reply.
---
Henchard was.
---
The ex- Mayor had left the home
 of his prosperity, and.
---
to which he had wandered on the night of his discovery
---
In this cottage he occupied a couple of rooms, Jopp, whom Henchard
 had employed, abused, cajoled, and dismissed by turns,.
---
" By nobody-- at present: that's his order
---
that he ruled there
 no longer
---
Abel Whittle was edging his skeleton in at the wicket, and
---
Mr. Farfrae is master here
---
," he said,".
---
Mr. Farfrae have bought the concern and
 all of we work- folk with it; and' tis better for us than' twas-- though
 I should n't say that to you as a daughter- law
---
I'm the richer man
---
which had remained in a paralyzed condition during the settlement of
 his bankruptcy
---
Henchard's stores,
, were stirred into activity again.
---
since it had been no uncommon thing for desperate men to wrench

---
Jopp in his time of
 distress had often stood here
---
A man seen there
 looking thus fixedly into the river
---
who saw him so
---
as if some strange fish interested him
---
To this bridge came Henchard,.
---
as other unfortunates had come before him,
 his way thither being by the riverside path on the chilly edge of the
 town
---
Here he was standing one windy afternoon when Durnover church
 clock struck five.
---
While the gusts were bringing the notes to his ears
 across the damp intervening flat a man passed behind him and.
---
Henchard turned slightly and
---
that the corner was
 Jopp, his old foreman
---
though he
 hated him
---
to whom,, he had gone for lodgings
---
because Jopp was the one man in
 Casterbridge whose observation and opinion the fallen corn- merchant
 despised to the point of indifference
---
Henchard returned him a scarcely perceptible nod, and
---
Jopp stopped.


---
" He and she are gone into their new house to- day
---
," said Jopp.


---
" Oh," said Henchard absently.
---
And starting up Henchard added," MY house of all
 others in the town!"


---
" Well,, it can do
' ee no harm that he's the man."


---
: he felt.
---
Farfrae,, had acquired possession of the
 house for the obvious convenience of its contiguity.
---
his taking up residence within those roomy chambers
---
while he, their
 former tenant, lived in a cottage
---
And yet this act
 of, galled Henchard indescribably.


---
Jopp continued:"?
---
He was bidding for no other than Farfrae all the
 while!
---
as he'd already got the
 lease
---
Surely he'll buy my body and soul likewise!"


---
he wo n't
---
And having
 planted these wounds in the heart of his once imperious master Jopp went
 on his way
---
while Henchard stared and
---
He was driving a gig,.
---
his direction being also
 townwards
---
Mr.
 Henchard?" came from it in the voice of Farfrae.
---
Henchard turned his
 face.


---
that he had guessed rightly
---
Finding Farfrae told the man who accompanied
 him;.


---
while he alighted and
---
" I have heard, Mr. Henchard?
---
" he said.
---
I have a real reason for asking."


---
Henchard withheld his answer for several instants, and.
---
I am going.'
---
when I
 prevented you and
---
when I persuaded
' ee
---
I was
 the master of the house in Corn Street.
---
But now I stand without a stick
 or a rag, and
---
o' the warrld," said Farfrae.


---
I'm used to it.
---
" Now listen to me, no taking up your time," said Farfrae,".
---
just
 as I listened to you
---
" But I can do nothing else, man!"
---
said Henchard scornfully.
---
I have
---
I have not felt inclined to go back to journey- work yet; but
---
I
 ca n't stay, and
---
what I propose
---
I am sure my wife
 would not mind it at all--."


---
Henchard started.
---
drawn by the unsuspecting Donald
 of himself under the same roof with Lucetta
---
," he said gruffly;
---
," said Farfrae;" and
---
Still Henchard refused.
---
," he said.

---
" However, I can do no less than thank' ee."


---
when
 Henchard persuaded the young Scotchman
---
have some supper" said Farfrae.


---
" By- the- bye, I had
---
I bought a good deal of your
 furniture.


---
" So I have heard."


---
no that I wanted it so very much for myself
---
I wish ye
.
---
I will have plenty of opportunities of getting more.
---
" said Henchard."
---
Henchard was a little moved.
---
" I-- sometimes think!"
---
I've wronged' ee
---
he
 said, in tones which showed the disquietude that the night shades hid in
 his face.
---
He shook Farfrae abruptly by the hand, and.
---
Farfrae saw.


---
him turn through the
 thoroughfare into Bull Stake and
---
He was sitting up in the bed with a greatcoat round him, and

---
Go away-- go away," he said.
---
I do n't

---
" But, father--"

" I do n't like
---
to see' ee," he repeated.


---
He soon was well enough to go out; and
---
He no longer thought of emigration,
 and.
---
The having nothing to do made him more
 dreary than any other circumstance; and one day, with better views of
 Farfrae than he had held for some time, and a sense that honest work was
 not a thing to be ashamed of
---
, he stoically went down to Farfrae's yard
 and.
---
He was engaged
 at once.
---
This hiring of Henchard was done through a foreman, Farfrae
 feeling that it was undesirable to come personally in contact with the
 ex- corn- factor more than was absolutely necessary.
---
While anxious to help
 him he was well aware by this time of his uncertain temper, and.
---
so that Henchard was

---
,
 and Henchard had become in a measure broken in
---
, he came.
---
what not stood as a day- labourer in the barns and
 granaries he formerly had owned
---
" I have worked as a journeyman before now, ha'n't I?"
---
he would say in
 his defiant way;" and
---
why should n't I do it again?
---
" But he looked a far
 different journeyman from the one he had been in his earlier days.
---
Then
 he had worn clean, suitable clothes, light and cheerful in hue; leggings
 yellow as marigolds, corduroys immaculate as new flax, and a neckerchief
 like a flower- garden.
---
Now he wore the remains of an old blue cloth
 suit of his gentlemanly times, a rusty silk hat, and a once black
 satin stock, soiled and shabby.
---
Clad thus he went to and fro, still
 comparatively an active man--.


---
for he was not much over forty-- and
---
the other men in the yard Donald Farfrae going in and out the green
 door that led to the garden, and the big house, and Lucetta
---
At the beginning of the winter that
 Mr. Farfrae, already in the Town Council, was.


---
said Henchard to
 himself.

---
when he heard of this one day on his way to Farfrae's hay- barn
---
He thought it over.


---
as he wimbled his bonds, and
---
the piece of news acted
 as a reviviscent breath to that old view of his-- of Donald Farfrae as
 his triumphant rival who rode rough- shod over him
---
A fellow of his age going, indeed!
---
" to be Mayor" he murmured with a
 corner- drawn smile on his mouth."
---
Here be I, his former master, and he the man standing as master, with my house and my
 furniture and my what- you- may- call wife all his own."


---
He repeated these things a hundred times a day.
---
During the whole period
 of his acquaintance with Lucetta he had never wished.
---
as he now regretted her loss
---
that moved him,
---
though that fortune had been
 the means of making her so much the more desired by giving her the air
 of independence and sauciness which attracts men of his composition
---
It had given her servants, house, and fine clothing-- a setting that
 invested Lucetta with a startling novelty in the eyes of him.


---
He accordingly lapsed into moodiness, and
---
at every allusion to the
 possibility of Farfrae's near election to the municipal chair his former
 hatred of the Scotchman returned.
---
Concurrently with this he underwent
 a moral change.
---
It resulted in his significantly saying every now and
 then, in tones of recklessness," Only a fortnight more!"--"Only a dozen
 days!"
---
as he worked
 beside Henchard in the granary weighing oats
---
" Because in twelve days I shall be released from my oath."


---
since I swore it
---
then I mean,

---
" Michael Henchard have busted out!"


---
for each man to strictly limit himself to half- a- pint of liquor
---
They were all exactly
 alike-- straight- sided, with two leafless lime- trees done in eel- brown
 on the sides-- one towards the drinker's lips, the other confronting
 his comrade.
---
Now the Three Mariners was the inn chosen by Henchard as the place for
 closing his long term of dramless years.
---
He had so timed his entry as to
.
---
The flush upon his face proclaimed
.
---
He was seated on a small table,, a few of
 whom nodded to him as they took their places and said," How be ye, Mr.
 Henchard?
---
Henchard did not take the trouble, and
---
his
 eyes rested on his stretched- out legs and boots."
---
Yes," he said at
 length;".
---
I've been down in spirit for weeks
---
I am better now, but not quite serene.
---
I want; and
---
what with that and this
 brew of Stannidge's, I am in hopes of getting altogether out of my minor
 key."


---
" I do n't care a curse," said Henchard.
---
" Hang Samuel Wakely's tune,!" said Henchard.
---
He took
 one of the psalters and.


---
Chancing to look out of the window at that moment he saw a flock of
 people passing by, and.
---
Among the rest of the
 leading inhabitants walked Mr. Councillor Farfrae with Lucetta upon his
 arm, the observed and imitated of all the smaller tradesmen's womankind.

---
Henchard's mouth changed a little, and
---
he continued.


---
I'll find some words to fit en."" Now then," he said," Psalm the Hundred- and- Ninth, to the tune of
 Wiltshire: verses ten to fifteen.
---
I gi'e
---
" His seed shall orphans be, his wife
           A widow plunged in grief;
        .

        
---
His vagrant children beg their bread
          
---
His ill- got riches shall be made
          To usurers a prey
---
;
         The fruit of all his toil shall be
          
---
that to his wants
           Their mercy will extend,
         Or to his helpless orphan seed
           The least assistance lend
---
A swift destruction soon shall seize
           On his unhappy race;
         And the next age his hated name
           Shall utterly deface."


---
I know the Psa'am
---
"-- I know the Psa'am!"
---
I
 would as lief not sing it.'
---
when
 he made a Psalm that nobody can sing without disgracing himself
---
-- I tell ye, and!"
---
He slipped off the table,."
---
" Thank ye, thank ye," said Henchard in a softened voice, his eyes
 growing downcast, and his manner that of a man much moved by the
 strains.
---
," he went on in low tones,."
---
He knew!...
---
what he was about
---
when he wrote
 that
---
If I could afford it
---
if I would n't keep a church
 choir at my own expense
---
when I was rich
---
I did n't need
, and
---
what I could have
---
now I be poor
---
I ca n't have!"


---
what I need
---
There's the man we've
 been singing about
---
"," said Henchard.


---
,
" that' twas meant for a living man,
---
," said Henchard triumphantly.
---
As for him,
 it was partly by his songs, and....
---
that he got over me
---
I
 could double him up like that-- and
---
yet I do n't."
---
He laid the poker
 across his knee,.


---
Elizabeth- Jane went up to Henchard, and

---
By this hour the volcanic fires of his nature had burnt down, and.
---
he was
---
Henchard walked blankly, like a
 blind man,
---
At length he said to her,".
---
I am a man to my word
---
I have kept my oath
 for twenty- one years; and
---
now I can drink with a good conscience....
---
If I
 do n't do for him
---
-- well, I am a fearful practical joker!
---
when I choose
---
He
 has taken away everything from me, and by heavens, if I meet him I wo n't
 answer for my deeds!"


---
These half- uttered words alarmed Elizabeth-- all the more by reason of
 the still determination of Henchard's mien.


---
Henchard did not answer, and
---
till they had reached his
 cottage
---
" No, no; not to- day," said Henchard; and
---
that
 to caution Farfrae was almost her duty,
---
, Farfrae and Lucetta might have

---
hence when
 business would not permit him.
---
that Farfrae should be thankful for such devotion
---
One day he answered her inquiry
 for his health by saying that he could not endure Abel Whittle's pitying
 eyes upon him while they worked together in the yard."
---
He is such a
 fool
---
," said Henchard,".
---
that he can never get out of his mind the time

---
when I was master there
---
" I'll come and wimble for you instead of him, if you will allow me
---
Henchard's threats had
---
through came,
 first Farfrae, and at his heels Lucetta
---
Donald brought his wife forward
 without hesitation,
---
that he had no suspicion
---
Henchard did not turn his eyes toward either of the pair,.
---
he twisted
---
as if that alone absorbed him
---
which ever prompted Farfrae
---
A feeling
 of delicacy, to avoid anything, led him.
---
where Henchard and his daughter were working
---
that
 Henchard had entered her husband's service,
---
which the happy and busy Donald was too far off
---
Henchard,
 with withering humility of demeanour, touched the brim of his hat to
 her as Whittle and
---
" said Henchard,.


---
as if he had not heard
---
" O yes, good afternoon, ma'am," he replied,.
---
" I
 am glad to see you, ma'am.."


---
Henchard
 continued:"
---
" he asked.


---
leading him away by the outer gates
---
The result of this casual rencounter was that the
 next morning a note was put into Henchard's hand by the postman.


---
Henchard with fond savagery, holding out the note
---
He threw the letter into the
 fire.


---
Farfrae was always considerate to his fallen acquaintance;
 but
---
that he should not, by degrees, cease
---
Henchard saw
 this, and.


---
his taking other
 liquor
---
The young man was quite
 unconscious of the action,
---
which was so indirect that, if Farfrae had
 observed it
---
, he might almost have regarded it as an idle outstretching
 of the arm.
---
where he once
 had been master
---
Yet, on the
 other hand, his subordinate position in an establishment might be acting on him like an irritant poison; and
---
if I were
 He could hardly discern her till,?"


---
, he said,

---
" Yes?" said he, with the cheeriness of a superior."
---
, I'm sure."


---
I sometimes fear,
---
that he
 may be betrayed into some attempt to-- insult you, sir
---
that he has been

---
that Farfrae
 was still incredulous
---
Henchard, a poor man in his employ, was not to
 Farfrae's view the Henchard who had ruled him.
---
Yet he was not only the
 same man, but
---
that man with his sinister qualities, formerly latent,
 quickened into life by his buffetings.


---
Farfrae, happy, and thinking no evil, persisted in making light of her
 fears.
---
But Donald Farfrae was one of those men upon whom an incident is never
 absolutely lost.
---
He revised impressions from a subsequent point of view,
 and
---
the impulsive judgment of the moment was not always his permanent
 one.
---
The vision of Elizabeth's earnest face in the rimy dawn came
 back to him several times during the day.
---
Knowing the solidity of her
 character he did not treat her hints altogether as idle sounds.


---
But he did not desist from a kindly scheme on Henchard's account that
 engaged him just then; and
---
when he met Lawyer Joyce, the town- clerk,
 later in the day
---
, he spoke of it.


---
," he said,"
---
It is not for myself, but for our
 unlucky fellow- townsman Henchard.
---
I want it
---
It would be a new beginning for him,
 if a small one; and
---
I have told the Council."


---
that I would head a private
 subscription among them
---
that I would be fifty
 pounds,
---
" Yes, yes; so I've heard; and
---
," the town- clerk replied, in his plain, frank way."
---
To my knowledge he was at the Three
 Mariners last night,."


---
that about you which a man ought

---
" said Farfrae,.
---
" Why should he
 do it?"
---
added the young man bitterly;" what harm have I done him?"


---
that he
 should try
---
much
 long- suffering in you to put up with him
---
discharge a man who was once a good friend to me.
---
" But I cannet How can
 I forget that when I came here' twas he enabled me'?
---
It grieved Farfrae much.
---
, he went and
.
---
when
 Farfrae spoke to him and
---
Donald mentioned Henchard's name,
 and
---
as he saw him
---
that a scheme of the Council for setting him up
 in a shop had been knocked on the head by Farfrae
---
When Farfrae got indoors that evening.
---
seized his hands, whereupon Farfrae duly kissed her.


---
that he looked serious
---
her eyes linger solicitously on his face
---
" he absently asked."
---
" Well-- nothing worth talking of," he responded sadly.


---
" No-- not always!" he said,.
---
as he contemplated

---
" I know many who have not been so!
---
There was
 Sandy Macfarlane, who started to America to try his fortune, and
---
he was
; and Archibald Leith,!
---
he was murdered
---
" Why-- you old goosey-- I was only speaking in a general sense, of course!

---
I couldna
---
It's Henchard
---
-- he hates me;.
---
so that I
 may not be his friend
---
if I would
---
I would understand; but
---
I cannet
---
see a reason for the whole intensity
 of what he feels.
---
," declared Farfrae soothingly;
.


---
though he did not know its seriousness so well as she
---
Farfrae seemed, and
---
Farfrae was sorry at the intelligence, and
---
he's been going some days
---
as his family is well provided for

---
Now I have called. If I should nominate' ee to succeed him, and will' ee accept the chair?"


---
may be thought pushing said Farfrae after a pause.


---
I do n't speak for myself only,
---
I'm over young, and
!"," Farfrae murmured.
---
I wouldna
---
We have had older men
 long enough."


---
When he was gone
---
Farfrae said musingly,"!
---
I will stay
---
Henchard must rave."


---
as he will
---
" Michael," said she,"?
---
I must again ask you
---
He could not say
---
-- he would consider.
---
he recollected
.

---
that he had left a heap of useless papers in his former dining- room
 safe--
---
now occupied by Farfrae
---
A grotesque grin shaped itself on Henchard's face.
---
Farfrae was Mayor-- the two- hundredth odd of a series forming
 an elective dynasty dating back to the days of Charles
---
He, in the meantime, festering with indignation at some erroneous
 intelligence of Farfrae's opposition to the scheme for installing him
 in the little seed- shop
---
which, by reason of Farfrae's comparative youth and his
 Scottish nativity-- a thing unprecedented in the case-- had an interest
 far beyond the ordinary)
---
The bell- ringing and the band- playing, loud as
 Tamerlane's trumpet, goaded the downfallen Henchard indescribably
---
: the
 ousting now seemed to him.


---
The next morning he went to the corn- yard as usual, and
---
about eleven
 o'clock Donald entered through the green door, with no trace of the
 worshipful about him.
---
The yet more emphatic change of places between
 him and Henchard renewed a slight
 embarrassment in the manner of the modest young man; but
---
Henchard
 showed the front of one who had overlooked all this; and
---
Farfrae met his
 amenities half- way at once.


---
to ask you," said Henchard," about a packet that I
 may possibly have left in my old safe in the dining- room."
---
He added
 particulars.


---
," said Farfrae.
---
" I have never opened the safe at
 all as yet;."


---
for I keep ma papers at the bank,
---
"," said Henchard.
---
" But I'll call
 for it this evening,?"


---
when he fulfilled his promise
---
He had primed himself
 with grog, as he did very frequently now, and
---
a curl of sardonic
 humour hung on his lip,.
---
as he approached the house
---
as though he were
 contemplating some terrible form of amusement
---
, the
 incident of his entry did not diminish its force,.
---
this being his first
 visit to the house since he had lived there as owner
---
The ring of the
 bell spoke to him like the voice of a familiar drudge who had been
 bribed to forsake him
---
Farfrae invited him into the dining- room, where he at once unlocked
 the iron safe built into the wall, HIS, Henchard's safe, made by an
 ingenious locksmith under his direction.
---
Farfrae drew thence the parcel,
 and other papers, with apologies for not having returned them.


---
Yes," he went on,,".
---
Mrs. Farfrae is well after her exertions of yesterday
---
Henchard returned to the letters,.
---
Farfrae being seated at the other end of the dining- table
---
", of course," he resumed," that curious chapter in the history of
 my past which I told you of, and that you gave me some assistance in?

---
married well," said Henchard."
---
Farfrae, willing to humour Henchard, though quite uninterested, and
 bursting with yawns, gave well- mannered attention.


---
who feels it impossible that she
 can be the wife of any other man; and
---
I quite acquit you of any
 intention to wrong me, yet
---
Thus I sit here,!'
---
" said Henchard," acres of words like
.
---
what I could not cure
---
" Yes," said Farfrae absently,"."
---
that he knew very little of the sex;
---
he worshipped

---
yet detecting a sort of
 resemblance in style between the effusions of the woman and those of the supposed stranger, he concluded.


---
Henchard unfolded another letter, and."
---
I do n't give
---
Her name," he said blandly.

---
As I did n't marry her, and
---
another man did
---
", I can scarcely do that in
 fairness to her."


---
" Tr- rue, tr- rue," said Farfrae."
---
Farfrae asked this and the other questions in the
 comfortably indifferent tone of one whom the matter very remotely
 concerned.


---
said Henchard, the new- moon- shaped
 grin adumbrating itself again upon his mouth.
---
when I came forward
---
Henchard seemed, and
---
he answered" Yes."


---
"," said Henchard emphatically.


---
He opened a third and fourth letter, and.
---
he approached
 the conclusion as if the signature were indeed coming with the rest
---
But
 again he stopped short.
---
that, as may be divined, he had

---
quite intended to effect a grand catastrophe at the end of this drama
 by reading out the name, he had come to the house with no other thought.

---
But sitting here in cold blood he could not do it.


---
Such a wrecking of hearts appalled even him.
---
His quality was such
.



---
that he could have annihilated them both in the heat of action; but
---
As Donald stated
---
The usual time for Donald's arrival upstairs came and yet still

---
whoever he might be
---
Her own words greeted her in Henchard's voice, like spirits from the
 grave.


---
But
 was the tone of her husband.
---
He spoke merely in the
 accents of a man who made a present of his time.


---
" One word," he was saying,."
---
that
 Henchard was unfolding yet another sheet
---
" Well, yes," said Henchard."
---
By not giving her name I make it an example
 of all womankind, and not a scandal to one."


---
If I were you
---
" I would destroy them
---
," said Farfrae,.
---
than he had hitherto done
---
" No, I shall not destroy them,
---
Then he arose, and
---
Would
 Henchard let out the secret in his parting words?
---
he
 might possibly have got over it, and
---
her husband bolting it
---
After looking
 round in his customary way he came leisurely up the stairs.
---
when he appeared round the bedroom door
---
that he looked at her with the rallying smile of one
---
When he had restored her Farfrae naturally enough
---
Of
 all men he was the least desirable as a visitor but
---
," he said;"
---
it is my
 belief that he's just a bit crazed.
---
He has been reading to me a long
 lot of letters relating to his past life; and
---
I could do no less than
."


---
as he stood on the doorstep
---
Henchard's last
 words to Farfrae, in short,, had been these:
"
---
I may tell more about her some
 day."


---
I overheard your interview with my husband last night, and
---
I will be at the Ring at the time

---
I
 can not rest, and."


---
till I have seen
---
Henchard came over the top, descended and Lucetta waited breathlessly.

---
But having reached the arena: he stood
 still at a little distance from her
---
that he was unmanned, and
---
his
 heart smote him for having attempted reprisals on one of a sex so weak.

---
When he approached her, and
---
as he had come down
---
His manner had been one of cynical carelessness; but

---
he now put away his grim half- smile, and.
---
," he stammered with unconcealed
 compunction.


---
Neither my
 husband nor any other man will regard me with interest long."


---
Henchard was disarmed.
---
His old feeling of supercilious pity for
 womankind in general was intensified by this suppliant appearing here
 as the double of the first.
---
; he felt ashamed,

---
no
 longer envied his bargain.
---
He had married money, but nothing
 more.
---
Henchard was anxious to wash his hands of the game.


---
he said gently.
---
" I am sure I shall be
 very willing.
---
I revealed nothing."


---
But, between you and me,
 Lucetta, he is sure to find out something of the matter, sooner or
 later."


---
then he may forgive me
 everything
---
Henchard silently looked at her:
---
he almost envied Farfrae such love
 as that, even now."
---
H'm," he said.
---
I swear it."


---
shall I get them?"


---
He reflected, and."
---
he would send them the next morning
---
Now do n't
 doubt me," he added.
---
" I can keep my word."




36.



---
to go in he came and.
---
It was Jopp.


---
He begged her pardon for addressing her.
---
But he had heard;.
---
that Mr.
 Farfrae had been applied to by a neighbouring corn- merchant to recommend
 a working partner
---
if so he wished
---
He could give good
 security, and; but
---
he
 would feel.


---
"
  said Jopp.
---
I was in Jersey several years, and."

" Indeed
---
what I
 covet very much," he persisted
---
He watched her, and.
---
When he got

---
there he sat down in the fireless chimney corner looking at the iron
 dogs, and
---
A movement upstairs disturbed him, and
---
Henchard came down from his
 bedroom, where he seemed to have been rummaging boxes.


---
"," said Henchard,".
---
I mean
---
I should take it myself, of course, but
---
I do n't wish."


---
He handed a package in brown paper, sealed.
---
Henchard had been as good
 as his word.
---
he had searched over his few
 belongings
---
that he possessed
---
Jopp indifferently expressed his willingness.


---
" his lodger asked
---
" I am afraid not," said Jopp, who had not told the other of his
 application to Farfrae.


---
He said goodnight to Jopp, and.


---
Jopp sat on
---
till his eyes were attracted by the shadow of the
 candle- snuff on the wall, and
---
he found.
---
Henchard's
 packet next met his gaze.
---
He knew; and
---
there had been something of the nature
 of wooing between Henchard and the now Mrs. Farfrae
---
his vague ideas
 on the subject narrowed themselves down to these
---
: Henchard had a parcel
 belonging to Mrs. Farfrae, and
---
he had reasons for not returning that
 parcel to her in person.
---
So he went on and on
 till,,
---
as he thought it,
 and
---
if there were any weak sides to this transaction
 with Henchard
---
, he examined the package.
---
The pen and all its relations
 being awkward tools in Henchard's hands
---
he had affixed the seals without
 an impression
---
, it never occurring to him.
---
Jopp was far less of a tyro
---
; he lifted one
 of the seals with his penknife,; and,.


---
His path was by the river- side at the foot of the town.
---
Coming into
 the light at the bridge he beheld
.


---
Jopp had mostly kept himself out of this company, but
---
present
 circumstances made him somewhat more reckless than usual, and without
 many words he decided to go to his destination that way.



---
when Henchard and Farfrae were Mayors
---
then, in a moment, he would vanish,.
---
That abstracted pedestrian
 had edged into the slit by the adroit fillip of his person sideways
---
;
 from the slit he edged into the tavern by a similar exercise of skill.


---
we rolled down together, close to his
 garden hedge.
---
O-- under, by
 Gad!' says he.
---
we passed his wood, an hour afore
---
who presently asked Jopp
---
what
 was the parcel he kept so snugly under his arm
---
" I was within
 a few yards of' ee dozens of times, with a sight more of birds than that
 poor one."

," said Jopp.
---
I'd like!
---
that I've got here
---
what he'd put inside
---
By this time Jopp had pushed his finger under the seals, and.
---
which he read aloud
---
" Mrs. Farfrae wrote that!
---
" said Nance Mockridge.
---
," said Nance.


---
the landlady said to the
 man who had been called Charl,"'.
---
Without replying Charl and his comrade Joe rose, and
---
there appeared from
 the shade a stalwart man with straps round his knees, a double- barrelled
 gun under his arm and some birds slung up behind him.
---
They asked him.


---
if
 he had had much luck
---
" Not much," he said indifferently.
---
Receiving a reply in the affirmative he went on inwards, the others
 withdrawing the bridge and beginning to retreat in his rear.
---
said the man in the moor.
---
I've
 had travelling enough for to- day.
---
that the man was no enemy
---
that's lost his
 way
---
He was a middle- aged man, with hair and whiskers
 prematurely grey, and a broad and genial face.
---
He had crossed on the
 plank without hesitation, and.

---
He thanked them, and."
---
he asked,.


---
They followed him into the inn, where the increased light exhibited him
 as one who would stand higher in an estimate by the eye than in one by
 the ear.
---
He was dressed with a certain clumsy richness-- his coat being
 furred, and his head covered by a cap of seal- skin, which, though the
 nights were chilly, must have been warm for the daytime, spring being
 somewhat advanced.
---
In his hand he carried a small mahogany case,
 strapped, and clamped with brass.


---
which confronted him through
 the kitchen door
---
Apparently surprised at the kind of company, he at once abandoned his idea of putting up at the
 house; but
---
taking the situation lightly, he called for glasses of the
 best,.
---
as he stood in the passage
---
"" he asked.


---
He turned back,."
---
He threw a sovereign on the table and
---
, he
 took his leave.


---
while we had him here
---
And I'll have nothing done but"

" Well," said Jopp;".
---
"!" said Nance.
---
Jopp gathered up the letters, and
---
he did

---
He reached home,
.
---
that at last no evidence remained of the unlucky episode with Henchard
 in her past
---
A Royal Personage was about to pass through the borough on his course
 further west, to inaugurate an immense engineering work out that way.
---
He
 had consented, and.


---
he had rendered to agricultural science and economics
---
that the sign- painter had in his shop
---
Henchard entered the room, in clothes of
 frayed and threadbare shabbiness, the very clothes which he had used to
 wear in the primal days when he had sat among them.


---
" I have a feeling,".
---
," he said,
---
that I should like
---
I suppose?"


---
I could walk with the rest
---
the young Mayor, who by virtue of his office sat in the large
 chair,.


---
as he would have been
---
I hardly see, Mr. Henchard
---
"," said he.
---
" I have a particular reason for wishing to assist at the ceremony."


---
Farfrae looked round.
---
I think
---
I have expressed the feeling of the
 Council
---
"," he said.


---
" Then I am?"


---
I am afraid so
---
Henchard did not reply to that very obvious suggestion, and,.


---
It had been only a passing fancy of his, but
---
I'll welcome his Royal Highness, or nobody
!"
---
he went about saying.
---
" I am not going!
---
to be sat upon by Farfrae,
 or any of the rest of the paltry crew
---
Longways, Christopher Coney, Buzzford, and the rest of that fraternity,
 showed their sense of the occasion by advancing their customary eleven
 o'clock pint to half- past ten;.


---
Henchard had determined.
---
He primed himself in
 the morning with a glass of rum, and.
---
whom he had not seen for a week
---
"," he
 said to her,"."


---
I
 should never have had the nerve to carry it out
---
he was going to the Three Mariners
---
no,
 he elbowed his way through the gay throng to the shop of Woolfrey, the
 draper.
---
In a few minutes he emerged,,
---
while more surprising still, in his hand he carried a flag of
 somewhat homely construction, formed by tacking one of the small
 Union Jacks, which abounded in the town to- day, to the end of a deal

---
Henchard rolled up his
 flag on the doorstep,.


---
pretty that,, he was experiencing the momentary weakness of
 wishing for her notice
---
But he was far from attractive to a woman's eye,
.
---
He was not
 only a journeyman, unable to appear as he formerly had appeared, but
---
he
 disdained.
---
as well as he might
---
Henchard had doggedly retained the fretted and weather- beaten garments
 of bygone years.


---
Lucetta's eyes slid over him to this side
 and to that without anchoring on his features--
---
as he stood in animated
 converse with his friends a few yards off
---
that her husband showed
---
as he
 talked
---
Every trifling emotion had its reflex on her face and lips, which moved in little
 duplicates to his.
---
At length a man stationed at the furthest turn of the high road, namely,
 on the second bridge of which mention has been made,
---
The carriages
 containing the Royal visitor and his suite arrived at the spot in a
 cloud of dust
---
into this space a man stepped

---
before any one could prevent him
---
It was Henchard.
---
he staggered to the side of the
 slowing vehicle,.


---
while he blandly held out his right to the Illustrious Personage
---
Farfrae, with Mayoral authority, immediately rose to the occasion.
---
He
 seized Henchard by the shoulder,.
---
Henchard's eyes met his, and
---
Farfrae observed the fierce
 light in them despite his excitement and irritation.
---
For a moment
 Henchard stood his ground rigidly;
---
Farfrae glanced to the ladies' gallery, and.


---
that
 his Calphurnia's cheek was pale
---
" Why-- it is your husband's old patron!"
---
" Patron!" said Donald's wife with quick indignation.


---
the man is an acquaintance of Mr. Farfrae's
---
" He works for my husband
---
that it was through him

---
your husband first got a footing in Casterbridge
---
Donald's genius would have

---
He would
 have been just the same!"


---
if there had been no Henchard in the world
---
It was partly Lucetta's ignorance of the circumstances of Donald's
 arrival which led her to speak thus, partly the sensation that everybody
 seemed bent on snubbing her at this triumphant time.
---
He alighted
---
In the crowd stood Coney, Buzzford, and Longways"
---
when he zung at the Dree Mariners
---
Some difference
 between him now and," said the first.

---
how he could get
---
," said Longways.


---
Nance did not reply, but
---
while Coney, Buzzford, Longways, and that connection remained in the
 street
---
, I suppose?
---
Coney looked at him."
---
" I have my doubts," said Longways.
---
" I heard."


---
If I were sure o't
---
I'd lay information
---
"," said Longways emphatically.

---
that
 the Scotchman is a right enough man, and
---
that his lady has been a right
 enough' oman, and
---
Coney reflected.
---
Farfrae was still liked in the community; but
---
that,, he had lost in the eyes of the poorer inhabitants something
 of that wondrous charm which he had had for them as a light- hearted
 penniless young man, who sang ditties as readily as the birds in the
 trees
---
Hence the anxiety to keep him from annoyance showed not quite the
 ardour that would have animated it in former days.


---
Buzzford saying to
 Coney,"
---
Yes, to- night," Jopp had said
 to the Peter's party at the corner of Mixen Lane."
---
To him, at least, it was not a joke, but a retaliation.

---
that her husband
 might possibly receive the honour of knighthood, though idle to a
 degree,
---
seemed not the wildest vision; stranger things had occurred to
 men so good and.


---
After the collision with the Mayor, Henchard had withdrawn behind the
 ladies' stand; and
---
there he stood,.

---
where Farfrae's hand had seized it
---
He put his own hand there,.

---
as if he could hardly realize such an outrage
 from one whom it had once been his wo nt to treat with ardent generosity
---
he distinctly heard her deny
 him--.


---
that he had assisted Donald,
---
that he was anything more than a
 common journeyman
---
He moved on homeward, and."
---
," said Jopp.

"
---
what if I have
---
And?" answered Henchard sternly.


---
He
 briefly related his attempt to win Lucetta's intercession.


---
Henchard merely heard his story, without taking it deeply in.
---
His own
 relation to Farfrae and Lucetta overshadowed all kindred ones.
---
He went
 on saying brokenly to himself,"...
---
And he-- how angry
 he looked.
---
He drove me back....
---
But he shall pay for it, and
---
how a
 coxcomb can front a man
---
being
 injured by him as a rival, and
---
snubbed by him as a journeyman,
---
that he should be

---
shaken at the collar by him as a vagabond in the face of the whole town.


---
Henchard went down Corn Street.
---
till he came to Farfrae's house, where he
 knocked, and left a message that he would be glad to see his employer at
 the granaries as soon as he conveniently could come there
---
Having done
 this he proceeded round to the back and.


---
as he had been aware
---
He had reached the granary steps
 and."


---
when he said to himself aloud
---
" I'm stronger
 than he
---
Henchard returned to a shed, where he selected a short piece of rope
 from several pieces that were lying about;
---
hitching one end of this to
 a nail, he took the other in his right hand and
---
turned himself bodily
 round, while keeping his arm against his side; by this contrivance he
 pinioned the arm effectively.
---
He now went up the ladders to the top
 floor of the corn- stores.


---
He fixed the door open and.
---
; here was the spot on which
 he had been standing with Farfrae when Elizabeth- Jane had seen him lift
 his arm, with many misgivings as to what the movement portended.


---
He retired a few steps into the loft and.
---
From this elevated
 perch his eyes could sweep the roofs round about, the upper parts of the
 luxurious chestnut trees, now delicate in leaves of a week's age, and
 the drooping boughs of the lines; Farfrae's garden and the green door
.
---
In course of time-- he could not say how long--.
---
Farfrae came through
---
He was dressed as if for a
 journey.
---
The low light of the nearing evening caught his head and
 face.
---
when he emerged from the shadow of the wall,
---
Henchard watched him with his mouth firmly
 set, the squareness of his jaw and the verticality of his profile being
 unduly marked.


---
Farfrae came on with one hand in his pocket, and.
---
that the words were most in his mind
---
They were those of the
 song he had sung when he arrived years before at the Three Mariners, a
 poor young man, adventuring for life and fortune, and scarcely knowing
 witherward:--

          " And here's a hand, my trusty fiere,
             
---
Nothing moved Henchard like an old melody.
---
He sank back."
---
No; I ca n't do
 it!"
---
he gasped.
---
Henchard looked out of the loft door.

---
" he said.


---
" Ay, man," said Farfrae.
---
" I could n't see ye.
---
A minute later Henchard heard his feet on the lowest ladder.
---
He heard
 him land on the first floor, ascend and land on the second,.
---
And then his head rose through the trap behind.


---
" he asked,.

---
" Why did n't ye take your holiday like the rest of the men?"
---
He spoke in
 a tone which had just severity enough in it to show that he remembered
 the untoward event of the forenoon, and his conviction that Henchard had
 been drinking.


---
Henchard said nothing; but
---
going back he closed the stair hatchway, and
.


---
; he next turned
 to the wondering young man, who by this time observed that one of
 Henchard's arms was bound to his side
---
" Now," said Henchard quietly,
---
before you affronted
 to extremes a man who had nothing to lose
---
I've stood your rivalry,
 which ruined me, and your snubbing, which humbled me; but your hustling,
 that disgraced me
---
, I wo n't stand!"


---
Farfrae warmed a little at this."
---
Ye'd no business there," he said.


---
he'd no business there!
---
The anger- vein swelled in his forehead
.


---
as he spoke
---
," said Henchard.
---
I am as loyal as you
---
" I am not here.
---
," said Henchard grimly.
---
If he likes
---
he may go down afterwards and or
---
he may tell the
 truth--.
---
that's his business
---
As the strongest man I've tied one arm to
.
---
There was no time for Farfrae to do aught but one thing, to close with
 Henchard, for the latter had come on at once.
---
It was a wrestling match,
 the object of each being to give his antagonist a back fall; and
---
on
 Henchard's part, unquestionably, that it should be through the door.


---
At the outset Henchard's hold by his only free hand, the right, was on
 the left side of Farfrae's collar, which he firmly grappled, the latter
 holding Henchard by his collar with the contrary hand.
---
With his right he
 endeavoured
---
which, however, he
 could not do
---
to get hold of his antagonist's left arm,, so adroitly did Henchard keep it in the rear.


---
as he gazed
 upon the lowered eyes of his fair and slim antagonist
---
Henchard planted the first toe forward,.
---
Farfrae crossing him with his;
 and
---
Then Farfrae tried and this part of the struggle ended by his forcing
 Farfrae down on his knees by sheer pressure of one of his muscular arms.

---
which was resisted by the larger man exerting all his force in
 a wrenching movement
---
as he was
---
Hampered, however, he could not keep him there, and Farfrae
 finding his feet again the struggle proceeded as before.


---
By a whirl Henchard brought Donald dangerously near the precipice;

---
his position the Scotchman for the first time locked himself
 to his adversary, and
---
as he might have been called from his appearance just
 now
---
he succeeded at last, though not until they had got
 far back again from the fatal door
---
In doing so Henchard contrived to

---
Had Henchard's other arm been free

---
it would have been all over with Farfrae then.
---
But again he regained his
 feet,.
---
He instantly delivered
 the younger man an annihilating turn by the left fore- hip, as it used
 to be expressed, and
---
following up his advantage thrust him towards the
 door,.


---
till Farfrae's fair head was hanging over
 the window- sill, and
---
his arm dangling down outside the wall
---
" Now," said Henchard between his gasps,".
---
" Then take it, take it!" said Farfrae.
---
Henchard looked down upon him in silence, and
---
he said bitterly.
---
" God is my witness that
 no man ever loved another as I did thee at one time....
---
though I
 came here
---
And now-- to kill' ee, I can not hurt thee!
---
Go and give me in charge-- do
-- I care nothing for what comes of me!"


---
He withdrew to the back part of the loft,.

---
Farfrae regarded him in silence
---
Henchard would fain
---
have recalled him, but
---
his tongue failed
 in its task, and
---
the young man's steps died on his ear.


---
Henchard took his full measure of shame and self- reproach.
---
The scenes of
 his first acquaintance with Farfrae rushed back upon him-- that time when
 the curious mixture of romance and thrift in the young man's composition
 so commanded his heart that Farfrae could play upon him as on an
 instrument.
---
So thoroughly subdued was he.

---
that he remained on the sacks
 in a crouching attitude, unusual for a man, and for such a man
---
He heard a conversation below, the opening of the coach- house
 door, and the putting in of a horse, but took no notice.


---
Here he stayed.
---
At length he arose,.


---
till he
 stood in the yard
---
" He thought highly of me once
---
," he murmured."
---
Now he'll hate me and

---
He became possessed by an overpowering wish to see Farfrae again
 that night, and by some desperate pleading to attempt the well- nigh
 impossible task of winning pardon for his late mad attack.
---
as he
 walked towards Farfrae's door
---
But he recalled the unheeded doings in the
 yard.
---
while he had lain above in a sort of stupor
---
he remembered

---
Farfrae had gone to the stable and;
---
put the horse into the gig while doing so
 Whittle had brought him a letter
---
; Farfrae had then said.


---
that he would
 not go towards Budmouth
---
as he had intended
---
-- that he was unexpectedly
, and that place lying but one or two miles out of his course
---
He must have come; and
---
when he first arrived in the
 yard, unsuspecting enmity
---
he must have driven off( though in a
 changed direction) without saying a word to any one on what had occurred
 between themselves.


---
though waiting was
 almost torture to his restless and self- accusing soul
---
He walked about
 the streets and outskirts of the town, mention has been made, an accustomed
 halting- place with him now.
---
till he
 reached the stone bridge of which
---
Here he spent a long time,.


---
the purl of
 waters through the weirs meeting his ear, and the Casterbridge lights
 glimmering at no great distance off
---
his listless attention was awakened
 by sounds of an unaccustomed kind from the town quarter
---
His first incurious thought
 engaged in an attempt
 to round off a memorable day in a burst of evening harmony,

---
But
 inexplicability did not rouse him to more than a cursory heed
---
; his sense
 of degradation was too strong for the admission of foreign ideas; and he
 leant against the parapet as before.




39.



---
When Farfrae descended out of the loft breathless from his encounter
 with Henchard
---
, he paused at the bottom.
---
He arrived
 at the yard with the intention of putting the horse into the gig himself
.
---
( all the men having a holiday), and
---
Despite the fearful struggle he decided still,.
---
He wished.


---
When he was just on the point of driving off Whittle
---
On
 opening it he was surprised to see that it was unsigned.
---
It contained
 a brief request that he would go to Weatherbury that evening about some
 business which he was conducting there.
---
Farfrae knew nothing that could
 make it pressing; but
---
as he was bent upon going out he yielded to the
 anonymous request, particularly as he had a call to make at Mellstock
 which could be included in the same tour.
---
Thereupon he told Whittle of
 his change of direction, in words which Henchard had overheard, and set
 out on his way.
---
Farfrae had not directed his man, and
---
Whittle had not been supposed.


---
Now the anonymous letter was a well- intentioned but clumsy contrivance
 of Longways and other of Farfrae's men.
---
when Farfrae was away
---
that the sound of his wheels might reach
 her ears early
---
which Henchard's show of
 effrontery had wrought in her
---
the temporary uneasiness disappeared with the quiet disappearance
 of Henchard himself under her husband's reproof.
---
The floating evidences
 of her absurd passion for him, and its consequences, had been destroyed,
 and
---
" I ca n't be sure for a moment
---
he's facing the tail.
---
The man has got on a blue coat and kerseymere
 leggings
---
; he has black whiskers, and a reddish face.'
---
He will see it,
---
wo n't he?
---
Donald will
 see it!
---
He is just coming home-- and
---
it will break his heart
---
-- he will
 never love me any more-- and
---
; he had been standing
 at his door, like others,.
---
as he
 saw the unhappy sufferer he said, in answer to Elizabeth's mute appeal
---
You
 must send at once for Mr. Farfrae.
---
Where is he?"


---
He has driven into the country, sir
---
He's likely to be back soon."


---
" Never mind, he must be sent for,."
---
in case he should not hurry
---
The man was, and
---
him clattering out of the yard at the back
---
Meanwhile Mr. Benjamin Grower, that prominent burgess of whom mention
 has been already made,,.
---
as he sat indoors in the High Street
---
He came to the corner above Farfrae's,
 and.
---
he had witnessed such rough jests before
---
His first move was

---
whom he ultimately found in hiding up an alley yet

---
expostulated Stubberd, in answer to Mr. Grower's chiding."'
---
Now," said Grower to one of the constables,
---
I'll go with
 Stubberd straight forward.
---
as Stubberd with Mr. Grower advanced into Corn
 Street
---
They passed Farfrae's, and.
---
Grower said
 magisterially to one of these in a fustian jacket, who smoked a short
 pipe and wore straps round his knees.


---
Mr. Grower repeated the words.


---
Charl shook his head to the zero of childlike ignorance."
---
I."

 Joseph was quite as blank as the other in his reply.


---
" H'm," said Mr. Grower.
---
that I know by sight
---
," he inquired,,"
---
addressing the nearing
 shape of Jopp have you seen any gang of fellows making a devil of a
 noise-- skimmington riding, or something of the sort?"


---
" O no-- nothing, sir," Jopp replied,."
---
Jopp suggested,.


---
as he rearranged his hand in his
 greatcoat pocket( where it ingeniously supported a pair of kitchen tongs
 and a cow's horn
---
" Now," said Mr. Grower,".
---
I'm much mistaken."


---
I hope?"


---
Surely," said Stubberd to one of the men,

---
" I saw you by now in Corn Street-- Grower spoke to' ee?"


---
The man,, shook his head absently.
---
he said to the woman who meditatively
 sipped her ale near him.


---
I came in for my quiet suppertime half- pint, and

---
The other constable was facing the clock- case, where he saw reflected in
 the glass a quick motion by the landlady.
---
Turning sharply, he caught her
.


---
" he observed,
.


---
what he knew
---
When he stood at the bottom of the street

---
a procession burst upon his view, in the act of turning out of an alley
 just above him.
---
The lanterns, horns, and multitude startled him
---
; he saw
 the mounted images, and.


---
He turned
 back a few steps and.
---
Unable to rest there he
 went to his step- daughter's lodging, and.
---
that Elizabeth- Jane
 had gone to Mr. Farfrae's
---
Like one acting in obedience to a charm, and
 with a nameless apprehension, he followed in the same direction in the
 hope of meeting her,.
---
he gave the gentlest of pulls to the door- bell, and
---
that Farfrae should be brought home
---
" But he has gone to Mellstock and Weatherbury!"
---
But, alas! for Henchard; he had lost his good name.
---
They would
 not believe him,.
---
lest he should
 never know the unexaggerated truth of her past relations with Henchard)
---
Henchard, in a state of
 bitter anxiety and contrition, determined.


---
To this end he hastened down the town,.
---
till he had reached a second and almost
 a third hill about three miles distant
---
In Yalbury Bottom, or Plain,
 at the foot of the hill, he listened.
---
He knew,.
---
it was Farfrae's gig
---
the vehicle having been his own
---
till bought
 by the Scotchman at the sale of his effects
---
Henchard thereupon retraced
 his steps along Yalbury Plain,.


---
the gig coming up with him
---
as he had
 intended
---
By diverging to that village, to do, Farfrae might probably delay his return by a couple of
 hours.
---
that his intention was
---
Farfrae's off
 gig- lamp flashed in Henchard's face.
---
At the same time Farfrae discerned
 his late antagonist.


---
Farfrae allowed.
---
before he pulled up
---
He then drew rein, and.


---
Henchard said.
---
I've run all the way here on
 purpose to tell ye."


---
Farfrae was silent, and
---
at his silence Henchard's soul sank within him.

---
who, four hours earlier, had enticed Farfrae into a deadly wrestle stood
 now in the darkness of late night- time on a lonely road,
---
where there might be a better
 opportunity of guarding himself from attack
---
Henchard could almost feel
 this view of things in course of passage through Farfrae's mind.


---
" I have
---
to go to Mellstock," said Farfrae coldly,.


---
as he loosened his
 reins
---
," implored Henchard
---
I can tell you particulars
."


---
The very agitation and abruptness of Henchard increased Farfrae's
 suspicion that this was a ruse to decoy him on to the next wood, where
 might be effectually compassed what, from policy or want of nerve,
 Henchard had failed to do earlier in the day.
---
He started the horse.


---
" I know,."
---
deprecated Henchard running after
---
as he perceived the image of unscrupulous villainy
 that he assumed in his former friend's eyes
---
But I am not!"
---
he cried hoarsely."
---
Believe me, Farfrae; I have come entirely on
 your own and your wife's account.
---
I know no more; and

---
Your man has gone the other way in a mistake.
---
-- I am a wretched man; but
---
Farfrae, however, did distrust him utterly.
---
He knew, but
---
he had left her not long ago in perfect health; and
.
---
Henchard's treachery was more credible than his story
---
He had in his
 time
---
He quickened the horse's pace, and.


---
after him lending yet more substance to his thought of evil purposes
---
The gig and its driver lessened against the sky in Henchard's eyes
---
;
 his exertions for Farfrae's good had been in vain.
---
He cursed himself
 like a less scrupulous Job,.
---
as a vehement man will do
---
when he loses
 self- respect, the last mental prop under poverty
---
To this he had come
 after a time of emotional darkness of which the adjoining woodland shade
.
---
Presently he began.
---
by which he had arrived
---
Farfrae should at all events have
 no reason for delay upon the road by seeing him there when he took his
 journey homeward later on.


---
Arriving at Casterbridge Henchard went again to Farfrae's house.
---
As soon anxious faces confronted his
 from the staircase, hall, and landing; and
---
O-- it is not he
---
The manservant, finding his mistake,
 had long since returned, and
---
all hopes had centred upon Henchard.

" But?
---
have n't you found him
---
Henchard replied."
---
as he sank down on a chair
 within the entrance
---
He ca n't be home for two hours."


---
Her anxiety to see her husband makes her
 fearfully restless.
---
Henchard regarded the sympathetic speaker for a few instants.
---
So much for man's rivalry,
 he thought.
---
He had liked the look on her face.
---
what he desired now
---
for the first time, he had a faint
 dream that he might get to like her as his own,-- if she would only
 continue to love him
---
Jopp was just going to bed.
---
when Henchard got home
---
the door Jopp said,"."


---
This is rather bad about Mrs. Farfrae's illness
---
Poor woman-- I fear!"

" Yes," said Henchard shortly, though little dreaming of Jopp's
 complicity in the night's harlequinade, and.


---
that Jopp's face was lined with anxiety
---
when Henchard was
 shutting himself into his own apartment
---
" Oh?-- who could he be?"


---
" He seemed a well- be- doing man--; but

---
he gave no name, and no message."


---
" Nor do I gi'e him any attention."
---
And, saying this, Henchard closed his
 door.



---
The divergence to Mellstock delayed Farfrae's return very nearly the
 two hours of Henchard's estimate.
---
when at length Farfrae did come back
---
he was in
.


---
much soothed by Donald's arrival
---
; he seldom or never left her side; and

---
to lisp out to him, he checked her feeble words, lest talking
 should be dangerous, assuring her there was plenty of time to tell him
 everything.


---
Up to this time he knew nothing of the skimmington- ride.
---
The dangerous
 illness and miscarriage of Mrs. Farfrae was soon rumoured through the
 town, and
---
became plain from
 Farfrae's own statements.
---
It was Henchard's, whose retiring to rest had proved itself
 a futility as soon as attempted; and
---
he gave it up, and.

---
He called as much on Farfrae's account as on Lucetta's, and on
 Elizabeth- Jane's even more than on either's.
---
Shorn one by one of all
 other interests, his life seemed.
---
whose presence but recently he could not endure
---
To see her
 on each occasion of his inquiry at Lucetta's was a comfort to him.


---
The last of his calls was made about four o'clock in the morning, in the
 steely light of dawn.
---
He went across,.


---
the
 sparrows in his way scarcely flying up from the road- litter, so little

---
said Henchard.


---
Henchard went home.
---
he lit his fire,
 and
---
He had not sat there long, a finger tapping
 lightly at the door.
---
Henchard's face brightened,.
---
for he knew the motions

---
"," said Henchard.
---
" I have but lately come in from there.
---
I will call' ee."


---
as he bade her
---
which Henchard had rigged up out of a
 settle in the adjoining room
---
him moving about in his
 preparations
---
he would not call her
---
finding; he
 waited on,.
---
as if it were an honour to have her in his house
---
In
 truth, a great change had come over him with regard to her, and
---
he was

---
He was disturbed by another knock at the door, and.
---
A stoutly built man
 stood on the doorstep, with an alien, unfamiliar air about his figure
 and bearing-- an air which might have been called colonial by people of
 cosmopolitan experience.
---
It was the man who had asked the way at Peter's
 finger.
---
Henchard nodded, and.


---
" Is it Mr. Henchard
---
I am talking to?" My name is Henchard."


---
I. Can I have a few words with you" By all means," Henchard answered,.


---
said his visitor,.


---
Henchard observed him indifferently, and.


---
My name is Newson."


---
Henchard's face and eyes seemed.
---
I
 know the name well
---
"," Henchard said at last,.


---
" I make no doubt of that.
---
I've been looking for' ee

---
I landed at Havenpool and and
---
when I got there
---
Back came I again, and by long
 and by late I got here by coach, ten minutes ago.'
---
He lives down by the
 mill
---
So here I am.
---
that I've called about
---
I was younger then, and
---
than I am now
---
a man's senses are
 himself."


---
I can not even allow that
 I'm the man you met then. I was not in my senses, and" We were young and thoughtless
---
," said Newson."
---
However, I've come to
 mend matters rather than open arguments.
---
I know it
---
", I know it.
---
I found it out directly
---
," said Henchard, still
 with averted eyes.
---
Then a man advised
 me, and
---
I've never returned to this country till a month ago, and I
 found as I supposed." Dead likewise," said Henchard doggedly."
---
he said, in a low voice."
---
Henchard, without answering, shook his head.


---
as if that were rather a
 question for Newson himself than for him
---
" Beside her mother," said Henchard, in the same stolid tones.


---
Henchard never looked up from the floor.

---
Henchard heard the retreating footsteps of Newson upon the sanded floor,
 the mechanical lifting of the latch, the slow opening and closing of the
 door that was natural to a baulked or dejected man; but
---
he did not turn
 his head.
---
Newson's shadow passed the window.
---
He was gone.


---
Then Henchard, scarcely believing the evidence of his senses, rose
 from his seat amazed at what he had done.
---
he had lately acquired for Elizabeth, the new- sprung
 hope of his loneliness that she would be to him a daughter of whom he
 could feel as proud as of the actual daughter she still believed herself
 to be
---
The regard, had been stimulated by the unexpected coming of Newson to a
 greedy exclusiveness in relation to her;
---
him to speak mad lies like a child, in pure mockery
 of consequences
---
He had expected questions to close in round him, and

---
unmask his fabrication in five minutes; yet such questioning had not
 come.
---
; Newson's departure could be but
 momentary
---
; he would learn all by inquiries in the town; and!


---
He hastily put on his hat, and.
---
that Newson had
 taken
---
Newson's back was soon visible up the road,.

---
Henchard followed, and.
---
his visitor stop at the King's Arms, where
 the morning coach which had brought him waited half- an- hour for another
 coach which crossed there
---
Newson mounted,
---
his luggage was put in, and
---
in a few minutes
 the vehicle disappeared with him.


---
He had not.
---
It was an act of simple faith
 in Henchard's words-- faith so simple as to be almost sublime.
---
who had taken Susan Henchard on the spur of the moment and on the
 faith of a glance at her face
---
The young
 sailor, more than twenty years before, was still
 so absolute as to shame him as he stood.


---
who had taken
 Henchard's words on trust
---
Perhaps not for long," said he.
---
Newson might converse with his
 fellow- travellers, some of whom might be Casterbridge people; and
---
This probability threw Henchard into a defensive attitude, and
---
instead
 of considering how best to right the wrong, and acquaint Elizabeth's
 father with the truth at once, he bethought himself of ways to keep the
 position he had accidentally won.
---
Towards the young woman herself his
 affection grew more jealously strong with each new hazard to which his
 claim to her
---
He watched,
 enlightened and indignant, to claim his child.
---
Possibly he had spoken to nobody on the coach, but.


---
His grief!--what was it, after all, to that?
---
which he, Henchard, would
 feel at the loss of her
---
And thus his jealous
 soul speciously argued.


---
He returned to the house.

---
," he said,.


---
" Father" it is, and
---
"," he replied.
---
how should I live but by my own hands."


---
Indeed I will, to see me."

 Henchard signified dubiousness.
---
Though he had so lately hoped
---
that
 Elizabeth- Jane might again live in his house as daughter
---
, he would
 not ask her.
---
Newson might return at any moment, and
---
his stepdaughter still lingered,.

---
at which Henchard was accustomed
---
Yet
 before the evening probably he will have come, and
---
, constantly repeated by Henchard to himself,.
---
His mood was no longer that of the
 rebellious, ironical, reckless misadventurer; but the leaden gloom of
 one who has lost all that can make life interesting, or even tolerable.

---
for him to be proud of,
---
nobody to fortify him;

---
In place of them he had no interest, hobby, or desire.
---
If he could have

---
his existence might even now have been borne
---
The merest trumpet or organ
 tone was enough to move him, and
---
high harmonies transubstantiated him.

---
that he should be unable to call up this
 Divine spirit in his need
---
The whole land ahead of him was as darkness itself
---
Yet in the natural course of life he might
 possibly have.


---
Henchard, however, leaving the town by the east road,
---
In a second or two he stood beside the
 weir- hole.
---
He looked backwards and
 forwards, and
---
He then took off his coat
 and hat, and.


---
While his eyes were bent on the water the pool he was intending to make his death- bed
---
till it passed under his eyes
---
then he perceived
 with a sense of horror that it was HIMSELF.
---
Not a man somewhat
 resembling him, but one in all respects his counterpart, his actual
 double, was floating as if dead in Ten Hatches Hole.


---
The sense of the supernatural was strong in this unhappy man, and

---
he turned away.
---
He covered his eyes and.
---
he took his coat and hat
---
Presently he found himself by the door of his own dwelling.
---
To his
 surprise Elizabeth- Jane was standing there.
---
Newson, then, had
---
" I thought.
---
He said to her,"?
---
I
 am not a read man.
---
I do n't know so much.
---
as I could wish
---
I have tried
; but the more I try to know the more
 ignorant I seem.
---
" I do n't quite think
---
he took her over the highway, and by the
 lonely path to Ten Hatches.
---
He walked restlessly,.
---
as if some haunting
 shade, unseen of her, hovered round him and
---
When
 they got near the weir he stood still, and.


---
" Go again," said Henchard," and."


---
Dear me-- I wonder!"


---
he could see her stoop.
---
" Well," said Henchard;
---
he cried bitterly."
---
Then Henchard shaved for the first time during
 many days, and.


---
him say,"
---
that he was in Somebody's hand
---
The apparition of Newson haunted
 him.
---
He would surely return.


---
Yet Newson did not arrive.
---
Perhaps, after all, Newson was gone for ever.


---
In due time the bereaved Farfrae had learnt the, at least, proximate
 cause of Lucetta's illness and death, and
---
his first impulse was
 naturally enough to wreak vengeance in the name of the law upon the
 perpetrators of the mischief.
---
He resolved
---
over ere he moved in the matter.
---
he reflected.

---
as he could
 see
---
for he knew nothing of Jopp's incitements
---
it was not altogether desirable, and for his own.
---
Henchard and himself mutually forbore.
---
For Elizabeth's sake the
 former had fettered his pride sufficiently to accept the small seed and
 root business which some of the Town Council, headed by Farfrae, had
 purchased to afford him a new opening.
---
Had he been only personally
 without doubt
---
remotely brought about by the man whom he had so fiercely assailed
---
But
 the sympathy of the girl seemed necessary to his very existence; and
---
on each day of their lives Henchard
 anticipated her every wish with a watchfulness in which paternal regard
 was heightened by a burning jealous dread of rivalry.
---
Yet that Newson
 would ever now return to Casterbridge.
---
He was a wanderer and a stranger, almost
 an alien
---
; he had not seen his daughter for several years;
---
his affection
 for her could not in the nature of things be keen
---
; other interests would
 probably soon obscure his recollections of her, and.
---
To satisfy his conscience somewhat
 Henchard repeated to himself.
---
which had retained for him
 the coveted treasure
---
Furthermore he pleaded within himself.


---
that no
 Newson could love her, or
---
as he loved her
---
Going out
 but seldom, and never on a marketday, they saw Donald Farfrae only at
 rarest intervals, and then mostly as a transitory object in the distance
 of the street.
---
Yet he was pursuing his ordinary avocations,.


---
men do after a while
---
But Farfrae was not of those.
---
that the insight, briskness, and rapidity of his nature
 should take him out of the dead blank which his loss threw about him
---
that by the death of Lucetta he had exchanged
 a looming misery for a simple sorrow
---
But as a memory, nothwithstanding such conditions, Lucetta's image still
 lived on with him,
---
By the end of a year Henchard's little retail seed and grain shop, not
 much larger than a cupboard, had developed its trade considerably, and

---
Sometimes it occurred to him; and
---
he was
---
troubled; one more bitter regret
 being added to those he had already experienced at having, by his severe
 censorship,.


---
that even I be in Somebody's hand," he said to her one day quite
 humbly.


---
" Yes; I bought it
---
He looked at it again.
---
though he was no judge of such articles
---
, he thought
.


---
" he hazarded.


---
Some little time after,,
 he paused opposite her empty bedroom in passing it.
---
He thought of the
 time when she had cleared out of his then large and handsome house in
 Corn Street, in consequence of his dislike and harshness, and
---
he had
.
---
what struck him about it
---
though he encouraged her
---
to buy
 in reason, he had no notion that she indulged her innate passion so
 extensively in proportion to the narrowness of their income.
---
For the
 first time he felt a little hurt by what he thought her extravagance,
 and.
---
before he had found

---
which set his thoughts flying in
 quite another direction
---
Henchard, contrary to his wo nt,
 went out one Saturday afternoon towards the market- place from a curious
 feeling that he would like to pass a few minutes on the spot of his
 former triumphs.
---
to whom he was still a comparative stranger
---
Farfrae,,
 stood a few steps below the Corn Exchange door-- a usual position with
 him at this hour-- and
---
he appeared.


---
he was

---
Henchard's eyes followed Farfrae's, and
---
he saw his own stepdaughter, who had
 just come out of a shop over the way.
---
that the object of his
 gaze was no sample- showing farmer, but
---
Henchard went away,.
---
that perhaps there was nothing significant
 after all in Farfrae's look at Elizabeth- Jane at that juncture
---
Yet he
 could not forget.
---
which had ruled his courses from the
 beginning and
---
what he was
---
that
 a union between his cherished step- daughter and the energetic thriving
 Donald was a thing to be desired for her good and his own
---
Instead of thinking, he hated the
 very possibility.


---
But he was not now the Henchard of former days.
---
He schooled
 himself.
---
He dreaded.


---
lest an antagonistic word should lose for him
 such regard as he had regained from her by his devotion,
---
But the mere thought of such separation fevered his spirit much, and in
 the evening he said, with the stillness of suspense
---
:" Have you seen Mr.
 Farfrae to- day, Elizabeth?"


---
He was wondering.
---
if her embarrassment
 justified him in a new suspicion-- that the long walks which she had
 latterly been taking, that the new books which had so surprised him, had
 anything to do with the young man
---
, he diverted the discourse into another channel.


---
Henchard was, by original make, the last man to act stealthily, for good
 or for evil.
---
into which he had declined( or, in another sense,

---
to which he had
---
But the solicitus timor of his love-- the dependence upon
 Elizabeth's regard advanced)--denaturalized him.
---
He would often weigh
 and.
---
when a blunt settling question would formerly have been
 his first instinct
---
which should entirely displace her mild filial sympathy with
 himself
---
And now, uneasy at the thought of a passion for
 Farfrae, he observed.


---
Whatever the origin of her walks on the Budmouth
 Road, her return from those walks was often coincident with Farfrae's
 emergence from Corn Street for a twenty minutes' blow on that rather
 windy highway--.
---
as he said
---
Henchard became aware of this by going
 to the Ring, and,.
---
till he saw
---
His face assumed an expression of extreme
 anguish.


---
" Of her, too, he means!"
---
he whispered."
---
But he has the right.

---
I do not wish."


---
matters were by
 no means so far advanced between the young people as Henchard's jealous
 grief inferred.
---
Could he have heard such conversation as passed and
---
he would
 have been enlightened thus much:--

 HE.--"You like walking this way, Miss Henchard--
---
I have chosen this road latterly.
---
I have no great reason
 for it."


---
that I wish
---
, I doubt there

---
I wonder
!"


---
if I ought
---
Henchard vowed.
---
that he would leave them to their own devices,
---
If he
 were doomed
---
In the situation he could see.
---
Farfrae would never recognize him more than superciliously
---
; his
 poverty ensured that, no less than his past conduct.
---
the end of his life would be
 friendless solitude.


---
With such a possibility impending he could not help watchfulness.

---
Indeed, within certain lines, he had the right to keep an eye upon her
 as his charge.
---
He was standing behind a wall close
 to the place at which Farfrae encountered her.
---
He heard.


---
the young man
 address her as" Dearest Elizabeth- Jane," and
---
Henchard came out from the wall, and

---
Both Farfrae and Elizabeth- Jane,
 unlike the rest of the people, must suppose;
 and
---
while he himself had the same belief
---
though Farfrae must have so far forgiven him
---
as to have no objection
 to own him as a father- in- law, intimate they could never be.
---
who was his only friend
---
, Henchard would have said,"."
---
I am content
---
One of these thoughts
 sailed into Henchard's ken now.


---
he were
---
that his betrothed
 was not the child of Michael Henchard at all-- legally, nobody's child
---
Suppose to communicate to Farfrae the fact;
 how would that correct and leading townsman receive the information?

---
He might possibly forsake Elizabeth- Jane, and
---
Henchard shuddered, and!
---
Why should
 I still be subject to these visitations of the devil,?"




43.



---
when I try so hard

---
What Henchard saw
---
That Mr. Farfrae" walked with that bankrupt
 Henchard's step- daughter, of all women
---
Farfrae attended,.


---
Perhaps the only inhabitants of the town to whom this looming choice
 of the Scotchman's gave unmixed satisfaction were the members of the
 philosophic party, which included Longways, Christopher Coney, Billy
 Wills, Mr. Buzzford, and the like.
---
The Three Mariners having been, years
 before, the house in which they had witnessed the young man and woman's
 first and humble appearance on the Casterbridge stage
---
that it was a wonder
 such a man as Mr. Farfrae," a pillow of the town," who might have chosen
 one of the daughters of the professional men or private residents,
 should stoop so low
---
, Coney ventured
---
that's a stooping to he
---
I see much good in it
---
When a man
 have put up a tomb of best marble- stone to the other one,, and
---
as he've
 done, and weeped his fill, and thought it all over said to hisself,
', I knowed this one first
---
, he
 may do worse than not to take her,
---
Not a hint of the matter was thrown out to her stepfather by Elizabeth
 herself or by Farfrae either.
---
Reasoning on the cause of their reticence
 he concluded.
---
that, estimating him by his past, the throbbing pair were
 afraid to broach the subject, and
---
as he
 was against society
---
Embittered, this moody view of himself took deeper and deeper
 hold of Henchard, till the daily necessity of facing mankind, and of
 them particularly Elizabeth- Jane.
---
His health declined
---
; he became morbidly sensitive.
---
He wished.


---
he
 could escape those who did not want him, and
---
if he were mistaken in his views
---
there were no necessity
 that his own absolute separation from her should be involved in the
 incident of her marriage?


---
He proceeded-- himself living like a
 fangless lion about the back rooms of a house in which his stepdaughter
 was mistress, an inoffensive old man, tenderly smiled on by Elizabeth,
 and good- naturedly tolerated by her husband.
---
It was terrible to his
 pride; and
---
yet, for the girl's sake
 he might put up with anything; even from Farfrae; even snubbings and
 masterful tongue- scourgings.
---
Farfrae as often made it convenient to create an accidental meeting
 with her there.
---
Hitherward Henchard often
 resorted, glass in hand, and.


---
his object being
---
One day Henchard was at this spot the road from Budmouth, and.
---
Applying his telescope to his eye
 Henchard expected.

---
that Farfrae's features would be disclosed as usual
---
that today the man was not Elizabeth- Jane's
 lover
---
as he turned in the
 scrutiny of the road
---
he revealed his face.
---
Henchard lived a lifetime the
 moment he saw it.
---
The face was Newson's.


---
Henchard dropped the glass, and for some seconds made no other movement.

---
Newson waited, and
---
Henchard waited--.
---
Then he would tell her not only of his paternity, but of the ruse by
 which he had been once sent away.
---
Newson would reign in her heart
 in his stead.


---
But Newson did not see anything of her that morning.
---
Henchard felt like a condemned
 man who has a few hours' respite.
---
When he reached his own house
---
he found
 her there.


---
Somebody has asked me, or in the evening at Mr. Farfrae's.
---
He says
.
---
he came, but
---
a trick was played him,
---
so that he
 did not see me
---
Donald is at the bottom of the mystery, and
---
that it is a relation of
 his who wants to pass an opinion on his choice
---
I do n't understand it; but between you and me I think
. But I did not like till I had seen you. Shall I go?"

 Henchard replied heavily," Yes."


---
his remaining in Casterbridge
---
The question of was for ever disposed of
 by this closing in of Newson on the scene.
---
Henchard was not the man to
.
---
And
 being an old hand at bearing anguish in silence, and haughty withal,
 he resolved,.


---
as he could
---
He surprised the young woman whom he had looked upon as his all in this
 world by saying to her, as if he did not care about her more:" I am
 going to leave Casterbridge, Elizabeth- Jane."


---
; I do n't care about shops and streets and folk
---
-- I would rather get
 into the country by myself, out of sight, and, and
."


---
that this
 resolve of his had come on account of her attachment and its probable
 result
---
" I am sorry you have decided on this
---
Nothing would induce him
---
he was not related to her other than as a step- parent

---
what he had

---
It was
 his conviction; and
---
he exclaimed;
---
" It is because of Donald!"
---
to marry him," said Henchard.
---
" He meant
---
when Newson should come
---
the same evening at
 dusk Henchard left the town,.
---
to whose development he had been one of
 the chief stimulants for many years
---
During the day he had bought a new
 tool- basket,.


---
He went secretly and alone,.
---
who had known him

---
not a soul of the many being aware of his departure
---
Elizabeth- Jane accompanied him as far as
 the second bridge on the highway-- for the hour of her appointment with
 the unguessed visitor at Farfrae's had not yet arrived-- and parted from
 him with unfeigned wonder and sorrow, keeping him back a minute or two
 before finally letting him go.
---
the yellow rush- basket at his back moving up and down with each
 tread, and
---
the creases behind his knees coming and.
---
that the serious addition to his years
 had considerably lessened the spring to his stride,
---
that his state
 of hopelessness had weakened him, and
---
He went on.
---
till he came to the first milestone, which stood in the bank,
 half way up a steep hill
---
He rested his basket on the top of the stone,
.


---
If I had only got her with me
---
"-- if I only had!"
---
he said.
---
I-- Cain-- go alone
-- an outcast and a vagabond.
---
as I deserve
---
He sternly subdued his anguish,.


---
Farfrae anxiously asked,"
---
is he gone--
---
did you tell
 him?--
---
I mean of the other matter-- not of ours.
---
" He is gone; and
---
I told him all I knew of your friend.
---
who is
 he
---
And Mr. Henchard
 will hear of it."


---
if he does not go far
---
He will go far
---
"-- he's bent upon getting out of sight and sound!"


---
At Farfrae's house they stopped and.


---
Farfrae flung open the door of the ground- floor sitting- room,
---
There he is waiting for you," and
---
who had called on Henchard on a memorable
 morning between one and two years before this time, and
---
It was Richard Newson.
---
The meeting with the light- hearted father from
, need
 hardly be detailed.
---
Henchard's departure was in a moment.
---
Henchard been her father in nature, this father in early domiciliation

---
when the incidents of
 her parting with Henchard had a little worn off
---
Newson's pride in to be was more than he could
 express.
---
He kissed her again and again.


---
" I've saved you the trouble to come and meet me-- ha- ha!
---
" said Newson.

---
" The fact is that Mr. Farfrae here and
---
, he said,',
---
I'll bring her round.''
---
so I will';
---
and here I am."


---
" Well, Henchard is gone
---
," said Farfrae,.
---
" He has done
 it all voluntarily, and,
---
as I gather from Elizabeth
---
, he has been very
 nice with her.
---
I was got rather uneasy; but
---
as I thought
---
," said Newson,.
---
" I said to myself, ay, a hundred times, when I tried
 to get a peep at her unknown to herself--'Depend upon it,' tis best that
 I should live on quiet for a few days like this till something turns up
 for the better.' I now know, and what can I wish for
 more?"

" Well, Captain Newson, I will be glad to see ye here every day now,
," said Farfrae."
---
what I've been thinking
---
" With all my heart," said Captain Newson;".
---
since,, it can
 do no harm, now poor Henchard's gone;
---
though I would n't have done it
 otherwise, or
---
I've already in my
 lifetime
---
; for been an intruder into his family quite as far as politeness
 can be expected
---
" Donald and you must settle it
---
Well, then," continued Newson, turning anew to Farfrae with a face
 expressing thorough entry into the subject," that's.

---
all
 that, I'll do my part in the drinkables, and
---
And, Mr. Farfrae, see to the rum and
 schiedam-- maybe a dozen jars will be sufficient?--
---
I've provided for men and
 shipmates times enough, but
---
I'm as ignorant as a child how many glasses
 of grog a woman
---
O no!" said Farfrae,.
---
I've
 never told ye, or
---
how Henchard put me off the scent
 that time
---
He expressed ignorance of what the Captain alluded to.


---
" Ah, I thought.
---
I had n't
---
I resolved.
---
that I would not
---
, I remember,
---
But now he's gone
---
I can tell ye.
---
Why, I came to
 Casterbridge nine or ten months before that day last week that I found
 ye out.
---
I had been here twice before then.
---
I passed
 through the town on my way westward,
---
Then hearing at some place-- I forget
---
where-- that a man of the name of
 Henchard had been mayor here
---
, I came back, and.
---
that the man was selling me a packet
---
Then he kept you from me, father, all those months,?"


---
The father admitted.


---
" He ought!"
---
not to have done it said Farfrae.


---
Newson, like a good many rovers and sojourners among strange men and
 strange moralities, failed,
 notwithstanding that he himself had been the chief sufferer therefrom.

---
Indeed, the attack upon the absent culprit waxing serious, he began.


---
" I said I would never forget him. I think I
 ought!"

" Well,' twas not ten words that he said, after all
---
," Newson pleaded.

---
" And how could he know?'
---
He knew
 your disposition-- you always were so trusting, father;
---
he did it.
---
he was my father
---
After
 weaning me from you these five years by saying, he
 should not have done this."


---
Even had he been present

---
Henchard might scarce
---
so little did he value himself or
 his good name.


---
I've heard and," said Newson
 good- naturedly.
---
Meanwhile, the man of their talk had pursued his solitary way eastward
, and
---
till weariness overtook him
---
he looked about for a place of rest.

---
His heart was.
---
that he could not
 face an inn, or even a household of the most humble kind; and
---
he lay down under a wheatrick,
---
The very
 heaviness of his soul caused.


---
him to sleep profoundly
---
He opened his basket and; and
---
what he had packed for his supper
---
he brought
---
Although everything necessitated
 carriage at his own back, he had secreted among his tools a few of
 Elizabeth- Jane's cast- off belongings, in the shape of gloves, shoes, a
 scrap of her handwriting, and the like, and in his pocket he carried a
 curl of her hair.
---
he closed them up again
---
Henchard's rush basket rode along upon
 his shoulder between the highway hedges, the new yellow of the rushes
 catching the eye of an occasional field- labourer as he glanced through
 the quickset, together with the wayfarer's hat and head, and down- turned
 face, over which the twig shadows moved in endless procession
---
that the direction of his journey was Weydon Priors,
 which he reached on the afternoon of the sixth day
---
when Henchard halted upon
 the summit
---
He deposited his basket upon the turf, and.


---
till he discovered the road by which his wife and himself
 had entered on the upland so memorable to both, five- and- twenty years
 before
---
," he said, after ascertaining his bearings.

---
I was reading a ballet- sheet.
---
He walked to
 another spot
---
but it seemed
 so to him."
---
I faced this way.

---
Then I drank, and.
---
It must have been just on that
 very pixy- ring that she was standing when she said her last words to me
 before going off with him
---
; I can hear their sound now, and the sound of
 her sobs:' O Mike!
---
I've lived with thee all this while, and.
---
Now I'm no more to' ee
---
He experienced not only the bitterness of a man who finds, in looking
 back upon an ambitious course,; but the superadded
 bitterness of seeing his very recantation nullified.
---
what he has sacrificed in sentiment

---
that was worth as much as what he has gained in substance
---
He had been sorry
 for all this long ago; but
---
his attempts to replace ambition by love had
 been as fully foiled as his ambition itself.
---
Part of his wish to wash his hands of
 life arose from his perception of its contrarious inconsistencies-- of
 Nature's jaunty readiness to support unorthodox social principles.


---
He intended.
---
But he could not help, and the quarter of the horizon in which she lived.
---
that the centrifugal tendency was counteracted by the centripetal influence of his love
 for his stepdaughter
---
As a consequence, instead of following a straight
 course yet further away from Casterbridge, Henchard gradually, almost
 unconsciously, deflected from that right line of his first intention;
 till, by degrees, his wandering, like that of the Canadian woodsman,
 became part of a circle of which Casterbridge formed the centre.
---
In
 ascending any particular hill he ascertained the bearings as nearly as
 he could by means of the sun, moon, or stars, and.

---
Sneering at himself for his weakness he yet every hour-- nay, every few
 minutes--
---
till thought of Newson's and
 Farfrae's counter- influence would pass like a cold blast over a pool,
 and
---
And then he would say to himself,"!
---
At length he obtained employment at his own occupation of hay- trusser,
 work of that sort.
---
The scene of his
 hiring was a pastoral farm near the old western highway, whose course
 was the channel of all such communications as passed between the busy
 centres of novelty and the remote Wessex boroughs.
---
He had chosen the
 neighbourhood of this artery from a sense that, situated here, though at
 a distance of fifty miles, he was virtually nearer to her whose welfare
 was so dear than he would be at a roadless spot only half as remote.


---
And thus Henchard found himself again on the precise standing which he
 had occupied a quarter of a century before.
---
Externally there was nothing
 to hinder his making another start on the upward slope, and
---
by his new
 lights achieving higher things than his soul in its half- formed state
 had been able to accomplish.
---
He had
 no wish to make an arena a second time of a world that had become a mere
 painted scene to him.


---
as his hay- knife crunched down among the sweet- smelling
 grassy
---
Very often, stems, he would survey mankind and!"


---
while I, an
 outcast, an encumberer of the ground,, live on against my will
---
He often kept an eager ear upon the conversation of those who passed
 along the road-- not from a general curiosity by any means-- but in the
 hope that among these travellers between Casterbridge and London
 some would, sooner or later, speak of the former place.
---
The distance,
 however, was too great to lend much probability to his desire; and
---
the
 highest result of his attention to wayside words was.
---
that he did

---
Henchard ran to the gate of the field he worked in, and

---
" he said, in answer to Henchard's
 inquiry
---
I trade up and down,;."


---
Anything moving in the old place, mid I ask?"


---
" I've heard.
---
that Mr. Farfrae, the late mayor, is thinking of getting
 married
---
" I could n't say for the life o' me.
---
O no, I should think not."


---
The man declared; and
---
he remembered nothing about it
---
Henchard was convinced.
---
He might, for that matter, write and inquire of Elizabeth; but
---
his
 instinct for sequestration had made the course difficult.
---
before he
 left her
---
that for him to be absent from her wedding
---
The remembrance would continually revive in him now.
---
that it was not
 Elizabeth and Farfrae, but his own
 haughty sense
---
who had driven him away from them
---
that his presence was no longer desired
---
He had assumed
 the return of Newson without absolute proof that the Captain meant to
 return;.
---
still less that Elizabeth- Jane would welcome him; and with no
 proof whatever that if he did return he would stay
---
if he had

---
if there had been no necessity that his
 own absolute separation from her he loved should be involved in these
 untoward incidents
---
To make one more attempt to be near her: to go back,
 to see her, to plead his cause before her, to ask forgiveness for his
 fraud, to endeavour strenuously to hold his own in her love; it was
 worth the risk of repulse, ay, of life itself.


---
But how to initiate this reversal of all his former resolves without
 causing husband and wife to despise him for his inconsistency was a
 question which made him tremble and brood.


---
He cut and, and
---
then he concluded his
 hesitancies by a sudden reckless determination to go to the wedding
 festivity.
---
Neither writing nor message would be expected of him.
---
-- his unanticipated presence would
 fill the little unsatisfied corner that would probably have place in her
 just heart without him.


---
To intrude as little of his personality as possible upon a gay event
, he decided
.


---
He started on foot, two mornings before St. Martin's- tide,.
---
There were only two towns,
 Melchester and Shottsford, of any importance along his course, and at
 the latter he stopped on the second night, not only to rest, but
---
he stood in
---
Possessing no clothes but, he entered a shop.
---
which should put him, externally at any rate, a little in
 harmony with the prevailing tone of the morrow
---
having satisfied himself that in appearance at least he would not now
 offend her, he proceeded to the more interesting particular of buying
 her some present.


---
He walked up and down the street,.

---
he might most like
---
that what
 to give her would be beyond his miserable pocket
---
At length a caged goldfinch met his eye.
---
The cage was a plain and small
 one, the shop humble, and on inquiry he concluded he could afford
 the modest sum asked.
---
with the wrapped up cage in his hand
 Henchard sought a lodging for the night.


---
Next day he set out upon the last stage, and.
---
which had been his dealing ground in bygone years
---
he travelled by carrier
---
Part of the
 distance, seating himself in the darkest corner
 at the back of that trader's van; and
---
as the other passengers,, mounted and alighted in front of Henchard,
 they talked over much local news, not the least portion of this being
 the wedding then in course of celebration at the town they were nearing.

---
He heard, however, but few particulars beyond those known to him
 already, the incident of the deepest interest on the journey being the
 soft pealing of the Casterbridge bells, which reached the travellers'
 ears while the van paused on the top of Yalbury Hill to have the drag
 lowered.
---
Those notes were a signal that all had gone well; that there had been
 no slip' twixt cup and lip in this case; that Elizabeth- Jane and Donald
 Farfrae were man and wife.


---
Henchard did not care.
---
Indeed, it quite unmanned him; and
---
in
 pursuance of his plan of not showing himself in Casterbridge street till
 evening, lest he should mortify Farfrae and his bride.


---
, he alighted here,
 with his bundle and bird- cage, and
---
It was the hill near which he had waited to meet Farfrae, almost two
 years earlier,.

---
Farfrae had another wife-- and,.
---
as Henchard knew, a better one
---
He only
 hoped.


---
He passed the remainder of the afternoon in a curious highstrung
 condition, unable to do much but think of the approaching meeting with
 her, and.
---
he would wait till their
 return.
---
To assure himself on this point he asked a market- man when near
 the borough
---
Henchard dusted his boots,.
---
He need
---
that
 Donald himself shared it,.
---
his voice being distinctly audible in the
 street,
---
that he loved so well as
---
these Henchard passed quickly on to the door.


---
His courage failed him;.
---
he loved,
---
Accordingly he went round into the street at the back
.


---
that he knew so well,
---
Solitude and sadness had so emolliated Henchard circumstances he would formerly have scorned, and
---
that he now feared

---
he began.
---
that
 he had not taken upon himself
---
However,
 his progress was made unexpectedly easy by his discovering alone in
 the kitchen an elderly woman who seemed to be acting as provisional
 housekeeper during the convulsions from which Farfrae's establishment
 was just then suffering.
---
though to her, a total stranger, his request must have

---
that he had better not wait in the kitchen,
 but
---
He thereupon
 followed her thither, and
---
till that was over before announcing
 him--
---
and Mrs. Farfrae having both joined in the figure.


---
that of the room Henchard sat in being ajar.


---
, he could see
 fractional parts of the dancers; together with about three- fifths of the band in
 profile, including the restless shadow of a fiddler's elbow, and the tip
 of the bass- viol bow
---
The gaiety jarred upon Henchard's spirits; and he could not quite
 understand.
---
who had had
 his trials
---
why Farfrae, a much- sobered man, and a widower,, should have cared for it all, notwithstanding the fact that
 he was quite a young man still, and quickly kindled to enthusiasm by
 dance and song
---
, he concluded, and
---
then for the first time he caught a glimpse of the once despised
 daughter who had mastered him, and.
---
, he was not near enough to say which-- snowy
 white, without a tinge of milk or cream; and the expression of her face
 was one of nervous pleasure rather than of gaiety.
---
Presently Farfrae
 came round,.
---
his exuberant Scotch movement making him conspicuous in a
 moment
---
Henchard could discern

---
that Henchard saw him
---
he was

---
The first time sweeping grandly round, his head quivering and low down, his legs in the
 form of an X and his back towards the door.
---
he came round
 in the other direction
---
The next time, his white waist- coat preceding his face, and his
 toes preceding his white waistcoat.
---
That happy face-- Henchard's complete
 discomfiture lay in it.
---
It was Newson's, who had indeed come and
 supplanted him.


---
Henchard pushed to the door, and
---
He rose to his feet, and."


---
obscured by
" the shade from his own soul up- thrown
---
But he was no longer the man to stand these reverses unmoved.
---
His
 agitation was great, and
---
he would fain, but
---
before
 he could leave the dance
---
he cried,."
---
that
 my father was not my father--
---
when he, my warm- hearted real father, came

---
which nearly broke his heart
---
Henchard's lips half parted.
---
But he shut them up
 like a vice, and.
---
How should he, there and then, set
 before her with any effect the palliatives of his great faults--?
---
that he
 had himself been deceived in her identity at first,;
---
till informed by
 her mother's letter that his own child had died
---
that, in the second
 accusation, his lie had been the last desperate throw of a gamester
 who loved her affection better than his own honour
---
that he did not
 sufficiently value himself
---
Waiving, therefore, his privilege of self- defence, he regarded only his
 discomposure."
---
," he said,
---
" I would not wish it-- at such a time, too, as this.

---
I have done wrong in coming to' ee--
---
I see my error.
---
I'll never trouble' ee again, Elizabeth- Jane-- no,
 not to my dying day!
---
Then,, Henchard went out from her
 rooms, and; and

---
departed from the house by the back way as he had come
---
the only difference between Donald's movements now and formerly was.


---
that
 he hastened indoors rather more quickly after business hours
---
than he had
 been in the habit of doing for some time
---
Newson had stayed in Casterbridge three days after the wedding party
( whose gaiety, as might have been surmised, was of his making rather
 than of the married couple's), and.
---
, were half- yearly
 occurrences, the inhabitants did not altogether lose their equanimity
 on his account
---
On the fourth morning he was discovered disconsolately
.
---
that he preferred Budmouth as a place of
 residence, notwithstanding the society of his daughter in the other
 town
---
Thither he went, and.


---
Donald Farfrae had
 discovered in a screened corner a new bird- cage,.
---
That farmer's
 man-- he was seen wi' it in his
 hand; and
---
as he came up the street
---
that he put it down

---
while he came in with his message
---
where
 he had left it
---
This was enough to set Elizabeth thinking, and in thinking she seized
 hold of the idea, at one feminine bound, that the caged bird had been
 brought by Henchard for her as a wedding gift and token of repentance.

---
He had not expressed to her any regrets or excuses for what he had done
 in the past; but
---
it was a part of his nature, and
.
---
When her husband came in
---
, whither Henchard had banished himself,
---
Although Farfrae had never so
 passionately liked Henchard
---
as Henchard had liked him
---
, he had, on the
 other hand,
---
as his
 former friend had done
---
he was therefore not the least indisposed to
.


---
But it was by no means easy to set about discovering Henchard.
---
He had

---
what he had once attempted
---
it Henchard had become a changed man since

---
In a few days Farfrae's
 inquiries elicited.


---
that Henchard had been seen by one who knew him
 walking steadily along the Melchester highway eastward, at twelve
 o'clock at night-- in other words, retracing his steps on the road by
 which he had come
---
the next morning Farfrae might have been discovered

---
, Elizabeth- Jane
 sitting beside him,.
---
before
 he should sink into that lower stage of existence which was only too
 possible to him now
---
After driving along the highway for a few miles learnt of a road- mender,, that he had observed.
---
; he had

---
such a man at the time mentioned left the Melchester coachroad at Weatherbury by a forking highway which
 skirted the north of Egdon Heath
---
Farfrae drove onward, and
---
Donald strongly advised
 his wife, and
---
to get back to
 Casterbridge that same day while to go much further afield would reduce
 them to the necessity of camping out for the night,"," said Farfrae.
---
He accordingly drew rein, but
---
his gait was shambling
---
;, his regard fixed in front of him as
 absolutely as if he wore blinkers; and
---
in his hand he carried a few
 sticks.
---
he descended into a ravine, where a
 cottage revealed itself, which he entered
---
" I should say.'
---
that must be
 poor Whittle
---
" And it may be Whittle,; and
---
for he's never been to the yard these three
 weeks,
---
I owing him for
 two days' work, without knowing who to pay it to."


---
Farfrae hitched the reins to the gate- post, and
---
; Farfrae knocked; and he who stood
 before them was Whittle, as they had conjectured.


---
His face showed marks of deep sadness,; and
---
he still held in his hand the few sticks he had been
 out.
---
as he recognized them
---
As soon he started.


---
" said Farfrae.


---
he was kind- like to mother,
---
He's just gone-- about
 half- an- hour ago, by the sun
---
; for I've got no watch to my name."


---
" Yes, ma'am, he's gone!
---
He was kind- like to mother,.
---
I seed en

---
I thought.
---
he looked low and faltering
---
And I followed en
 over Grey's Bridge, and
---
he turned and, and!'

---
But I followed, and
---
he turned again, and?
---
But I zeed, and
---
that he was low
---
I followed on still.
---
Then he walked on, and
---
he
 never complained at me no more.
---
that he wambled
---
him to come back
---
, when' twas hardly day, I looked ahead o' me,
 and I zeed, and. I had seen, and I got; and I took down the boards from the
 windows, and.' What, Whittle,' he said,' and!'
---
Then
 I went on further, and
---
But he did n't gain strength, no appetite at all-- and and
 to- day
---
ma'am, he could n't eat--
---
he got weaker;
---
he died.
---
" said Farfrae.


---
" Upon the head of his bed he pinned a piece of paper, with some writing
 upon it
---
," continued Abel Whittle."
---
while he ran into the cottage
---
That Elizabeth- Jane Farfrae be not told of my death, or
---
that no man remember me
---
" to do?" said Donald, when he had handed the paper to her.


---
O I would not have minded so

---
What Henchard had written in the anguish of his dying
---
though less from a sense of the
 sacredness of last words, as such, than from her independent knowledge
 that the man meant
---
what he said
---
that his whole life was made of
---
