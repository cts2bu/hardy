on the apex of the whole sat a woman," young" and
 attractive
---
said the girl, in a soft, though
 not particularly low voice.
---
" she answered.

---
The girl on the summit of the load sat motionless,
,
 together with
 a caged canary-- all probably from the windows of the
 house.
---
she gazed
 with half- closed eyes, and.

---
The handsome girl waited for some time idly in her
 place, and.
---
Then she looked attentively downwards.
---
She
 turned her head.

---
her- eyes crept back to
 the package, her thoughts seeming to run upon what
 was inside it.
---
At length she drew the article into her
 lap, and
---
in which she proceeded.
---
She parted her lips and
.

---
the sun lighted up to a
 scarlet glow the crimson jacket she wore, and.
---
her
 were fresh and green, and
---
What possessed
 her
---
to indulge in such a performance in the sight of the
 sparrows, blackbirds, and unperceived farmer to test her capacity in that art,-- nobody
 knows.
---
She blushed
 at herself, and
---
Woman's prescriptive
 infirmity had stalked into the sunlight,.
---
There was no necessity whatever for her looking
 in the glass.
---
She did not adjust her hat, or.
---
that any such intention had been her motive in
 taking up the glass
---
She simply observed herself as a
 fair product of Nature in the feminine kind,.
---
her thoughts
 seeming
---
She
 put the glass in the paper, and the whole again into its
 place.

---
she says.
---
she wo n't pay any more
---
the young woman pass
---
;
 she heard his words, and.

---
The redjacketed and dark-
 haired maiden seemed, and.
---
for she carelessly
 glanced over him
---
She
 might have looked her thanks to Gabriel on a minute
 scale, but
---
she did not speak them
---
; more probably she
 felt none, for
---
how women take a favour of
 that kind
---
That's a handsome maid
---
But she has her faults.
---
witnessed her performance over the hedge, and"





---
that a she d occupied a place here,

---
The place contained two women and two cows.
---
One
 of the women was past middle age.
---
Her companion was ap-
 parently young and graceful
---
She wore no bonnet or het, but.
 "
---
which was carelessly flung over her head
 as a covering
---
if she recovers
---
The young woman, whose eyelids were apparently inclined
 to fall together on the smallest provocation of silence,.
 
---
"," she said.
 
---
in which
 Nature, like a busy mother, seems
---
By one of those whimsical coincidences to spare a moment
 from her unremitting labours to turn and make her
 children smile, the girl now dropped the cloak, and
 forth tumbled ropes of black hair over a red jacket.

---
They placed the calf beside its mother again,
---
she d
---
She was the young woman of the night before.

---
she had mentioned
 as having lost in the wind
---
; possibly she had come.
---
She came up and.
---
The girl,, looked around for
 a moment,.
---
The
 rapidity of her glide into this position was that of a
 kingfisher-- its noiselessness that of a hawk.
---
Thus she passed under the level boughs.

---
, she began,
 even more obviously convenient than the first.
---
She had
 no side- saddle, and
---
it was very apparent that a firm
 seat upon the smooth leather beneath her was un-
 attainable sideways.
---
Springing to her accustomed
 perpendicular like a bowed sapling, and satisfying her,
 self, she seated herself in the
 manner demanded by the saddle,, and.

---
, the girl returned, with a bag of bran in front of her.
---
she was met by a boy bringing
 a milking- pail, who held the reins of the pony whilst
 she slid off
---
Soon soft shirts alternating with loud shirts came
 in regular succession from within the she d, the obvious
 sounds of a person milking a cow.
---
she
 would follow in leaving the hill
---
She came, the pail in one hand, hanging against her
 knee.
---
There was a bright air and manner
 about her now,
---
by which she seemed.

---
that the
 desirability of her existence could not be questioned;
 and
---
that she saw
---
she now presented
 him with
---
The adjustment of the farmer's hazy conceptions of her
 charms to the portrait of herself was less a diminution than a difference.
---
She seemed tall, but
---
, she could have been not
 above the height to be chosen by women as best.
---
From the contours of her
 figure in its upper part, she must have had a beautiful
 neck and shoulders; but.
---
since her infancy nobody had

---
Had she been put into a low dress

---
she would have run and.

---
Yet she was not a shy girl by any means
---
; it was merely
 her instinct to draw the line dividing the seen from the
 unseen higher than they do it in towns.

---
to have a tickling effect upon virgin faces
 in rural districts; she brushed hers with her hand,.
---
the free air of her previous movements was

---
she, and, from a sense of proportion,
 kept down to a small smile an inclination to laugh dis-
 tinctly: 
---
" She was surprised.
---
""
 she said.

---
" A large farm?" she inquired,,
 and; but
---
she went on.

---
" she inquired, a misgiving bringing every
 muscle of her lineaments and frame to a standstill.

---
she had

---
ceeded in the girl by a nettled palpitation,
---
It was a time to see a woman redden who
 was not given to reddening as a rule; not a point in
 the milkmaid but was of the deepest rose- colour.
---
when she would recover coolness sufficient to
 justify him in facing her again
---
She had gone away.

---
The young
 woman came regularly, but.
---
she appeared.
---
The
 young girl with the remarkably pleasant lips and white
 teeth was beside him.
---
She seemed, but of too insignifi-
 ca nt a kind to start enjoyment.

---
" Nothing now', she answered,"
---
she ob-
.
---
her to be that novelty
 among women-- one who finished a thought before
 beginning the sentence which was to convey it
---
she knew his impressions
---
She made and
---
said the girl,.

---
" O no," the girl replied.
---
She seemed talk that should harmonise with the dignity of
 such a deed-- and
---
she shunned it.

---
I know your aunt's, but not yours."

---
You can inquire at my aunt's
---
"-- she will tell you."

---
She hesitated,.
---
" she said, and.

---
She gave him her hand again.

---
she, though with-
 out pulling it away" But I suppose
---
" She snatched back her hand.

---
she said, teasingly; and
.





---
This well- favoured and comely girl soon made appre-
 ciable inroads upon the emotional constitution of young
 Farmer Oak.

---
that the girl's name
 was Bathsheba Everdene, and
---
Bathsheba Everdene
 came up the hill no more.
---
I'll make her my wife, or upon my soul
---
she had worn on the hill
---
Bathsheba's aunt was indoors."
---
Will you tell Miss
 Everdene?"
---
that somebody would be glad to speak to
 her
---
Bathsheba was out.
---
" I've brought a lamb for Miss Everdene.

---
she might like one
---
to rear; girls do."

---
" She might.
---
though
 she's only a visitor here
---
,
 Bathsheba will be in."

---
if she'd like
---
if she would
---
Because, I should be very glad
 to marry her.
---
if she's got
---
, she's.
---
-- she was going
---
once, only she was too wild
---
Lord, in the
 nature of women, she must have a dozen!"

---
It was
 Bathsheba Everdene.
---
I--" she said,.

---
!" she said.
---
that my aunt made a mistake in sending you away from
 courting me-- -- --"
 Gabriel expanded."I'm sorry to have made you
 run so fast, my dear
---
quite a mistake- aunt's telling you
---
" already."- Bathsheba went on."
---
as times go with women
---
when she had eased her side by pressing
 it there
---
which,, was prettily extended upon her bosom to still
 her loud- beating heart
---
she put
 it behind her
---
Bathsheba had overtaken him at a point.
---
Seeing threatening a possible enclosure, if not compression, of
 her person, she edged off round the bush.
"
---
" she said,
---
she said
 eagerly, and yet half conscious of the absurdity of the
 position she had made for herself--".
---
as my aunt said
---
she observed,
---
" Bathsheba looked thought-
 fully into the distance, away from the direction in which
 Gabriel stood.

---
Her countenance fell, and
---
she was silent awhile.

---
Bathsheba decisively turned to him.
"
---
" she said.
---
since a woman ca n't show off in that
 way by herself
---
At this criticism of her statement Bathsheba made
 an addition to her dignity by a slight sweep away
 from him.

---
what a
 maid can say stupider than that
---
" she said,.

---
" Yes, but-- --"
 She contracted a yawn to an inoffensive smallness,
.
---
"" she said.
---
not to have you" she said with a little distress, and
."
---
However she seemed, and.
---
" she said, with luminous distinctness and
 common sense,.
---
I am staying with my
 aunt for my bare sustenance
---
Bathsheba was

---
she said, almost angrily,.

---
" she
 exclaimed,
---
that she was gone
---
that she had gone to a place called Weatherbury,
 more than twenty miles off,
---
what would she have

---
which
 had only a few days to last-- the morning star dogging
 her on the left hand
---
where Bathsheba had gone
 two months before
---
Bathsheba had probably left Weatherbury long before
 this time, but
---
Be as' twill, she's a fine handsome body.
---
But that's only the skin of the
 woman, and
---
She's a very vain feymell
---
If so be' tis like that, I ca n't look her in
 the face.
---
" Yes-- she's very vain.'
---
that every night at
 going to bed she looks in the glass
---
And how do she play?"

---
that they might
 be speaking of Bathsheba
---
the woman alluded.
---
By her side was another
 woman, on foot.
---
said the woman on foot.
---
The young woman on the pony rode out from the
 shade and.
"
---
?" she said.

---
"?" said
 the second woman,.

---
" said the young woman on
 horseback,.
---
the girl on horseback," go to him
, and
---
She delivered her
 message.

---
That's she, back there upon the pony."
---
" wi' her face."

---
She lifted the wool veil tied round her face, and
.
---
Bathsheba did not speak, and
---
A TIMID GIRL


 BATHSHEBA withdrew into the shade.
---
She scarcely
 knew.

---
she was not, and
---
she" remembered
 Gabriel's declaration of love to her at Norcombe.

---
she had nearly forgotten it
---
" Yes," she murmured,
---
to speak to the bailiff, said
 Bathsheba.

---
" said
 Bathsheba,
---
Bathsheba then rode off into the darkness, and
---
with which the unpractised girl
 of Norcombe had developed into the supervising and cool
 woman here
---
But some women only require an emerg-
 ency.

---
It was a slim girl,.

---
The girl hesitated and.
---
She seemed",.

---
" Yes-- --" The woman again paused.
---
that she did add
---
""
 she said, timorously.

---
She may have
 perceived the direction of his face,?"

---
for she said
 coaxingly,--
"
---
Then she was silent and shivered.

---
She extended her hand
---
It suggested a
 consumption too great of a vitality which, to judge from
 her figure and stature, was already too little.

---
The young girl remained motionless by the tree, and

---
No-- I've hardly looked at her at all."
---
when I seed her,'
---
when she was speaking
 to me
---
Yes-- mother was
 concerned to her heart about it-- yes.
---
They took me
 to Greenhill Fair, and into a great gay jerry- go- nimble
 show, where there were women- folk riding round--
 standing upon horses, with hardly anything on but their
 smocks; but.
---
what sort of a mis'ess is she to
 work under?"
---
She only
 showed herself a few days ago.
---
,
 she's going.
  
---
, there was none like those in Farmer
 Everdene's kitchen.
---
she's not herself; and

---
if she
 had the good fortune to get into Heaven when' a died
---
she was a lovely woman.
---
I could never wish for a handsomer woman
 than I've got,
---
feeling she's ticketed as my lawful
 wife
---
Good- Morning, Mister Everdene;' tis
 a fine day!"" Amen" said Everdene,
---
she'd have growed up such a handsome body
---
as she is
---
her temper is as good as her face
---
Bathsheba see
---
Well, ye see, neighbours, I was lately married to a
 woman, and
---
she's my vocation now, and so ye see-- --"
 The young man hated lamely.
  " New Lords new laws, as the saying is, I suppose,"
 remarked Coggan.
  "
---
that after Miss
 Everdene got home
---
she went out again.
---
as she usually do
---
She fleed at him  like a cat-- never
 such a tomboy as she is-- of course I speak with closed
 doors?"
  
---
" She fleed at him, and,,

---
her promising
---
" Fanny Robin-- Miss everdene's youngest servant--
 ca n't be found.
---
she is n't come in.
---
if she
 had n't been noticed in such low spirits these last few
 days, and
---
" Well-- Miss Everdene wants.
---
What with this trouble about
 the baily, and now about the girl, mis'ess is almost wild."
  
---
"?" she said anxiously.
  
---
two or three of you to
 make inquiries in the villages round if they have seen
 such a person as Fanny Robin
---
She must have left."
  
---
" had she any young man court-
 ing her in the parish, ma'am?" asked Jacob Smallbury.
  
---
said Bathsheba.
  
---
The most mysterious
 matter connected with her absence-- indeed, the only
 thing-- is."
  "
---
that she was

---
And, ma'am, excusing my words, that a
 young woman would hardly go."
---
" That's true-- she would
 not, ma'am."
  
---
" She had a bundle,.
---
" But she had no
 young man about here.
---
Bathsheba said.
  
---
" No, mistress; she was very close about it."
  
---
if she does n't return tomorrow
---
if she
 had had any friends or relations alive
---
she
 has come to no harm through a man of that kind....

---
Bathsheba had so many reasons for uneasiness.
---
she did not think it worth while to dwell
 upon any particular one
---
" Do, then"
 she said in conclusion,.
  
---
Night had always been the time at which he saw Bath-
 sheba most vividly, and through the slow hours of
 shadow he tenderly regarded her image now.
---
In the room Bathsheba and her servant- companion, Liddy Small-
 bury were.
---
Liddy, the maltster's
 great- granddaughter, was about Bathsheba's equal in
 age, and.
---
her face was a prominent advertisement of the
 features'
---
Though elastic in
 nature she was less daring than Bathsheba, and
---
To
 think of her was
---
to get good- humoured; to speak of
 her was.
  
---
said Bathsheba
 through the door to her.
---
" What impertinence!" said Liddy, in a low voice.

---
" Be quiet!" said Bathsheba.
  
---
The further expression of Liddy's concern was.
  
---
she, fluttering under the
 onset of a crowd of romantic possibilities
---
said Bathsheba.
  
---
Liddy held up her hands and arms,.
  
---
said Bathsheba,
.
  
---
which
 had lain in her bosom a minute or more
---
Is Miss Everdene at home
---
I ca n't live without scratching
   A woman's dress being a part of her countenance,
 and
---
any disorder in the one being of the same nature
 with a malformation or wound in the other, Bathsheba
 said at once--
  ".
---
hardly naturalized in Weatherbury
 farmhouses, so Liddy suggested--".
---
" Miss is dusting bottles, sir, and
---
if anything had been heard
 of Fanny Robin?"
  
---
William
 Smallbury is gone to Casterbridge, where her young
 man lives,, and
---
" said Bathsheba.
  
---
," Bathsheba said,

---
as she had no friends in her childhood
---
"?" said Liddy.
  
---
and I said," To Miss Everdene's please,"
---
She is a staid woman," and

---
is n't she, my little man?
---
said Bathsheba,
 discontentedly.'
---
Liddy
 ventured."
---
Bathsheba paused, as if about to refuse a reply, but

---
since it was really in her
 power
---
the temptation to say yes, was irresistible by aspiring virginity, in spite of
 her spleen at having been published as old.
  "
---
she said, in a highly experi-
 enced tone and the image of Gabriel Oak,.
  
---
"" said Liddy, with the fixed
 features of mental realization.
---
Liddy looked from a back window into the courtyard
 behind,.
---
Two or three women in pattens brought up the rear.
  
---
said Liddy,.
  
---
followed by Liddy
---
CHAPTER X



 HALF- AN- HOUR later Bathsheba, in finished dress,


 and, entered the upper end of the old
 hall.
---
She sat
 down at a table and.
---
From this
 she poured a small heap of coin.
---
Liddy chose a
 position at her elbow and.
  
---
said Bathsheba,".
---
, have you heard anything of
 Fanny?"
  
---
she had gone there
---
nobody
 had seed her
---
said Bathsheba,
 looking at her watch.
---
Well, now then"-- she looked into the book--" Joseph
 Poorgrass,"
  
---
Bathsheba blushed slightly at the sense of being
 generous in public, and
---
who had drawn
 up towards her chair
---
continued Bathsheba.
  
---
Henery Fray, correct-
 ingly, from behind her chair, to which point edged himself
---
" Matthew Moon." murmured Bathsheba,.
---
oh, here's another,
 Soberness-- both women I suppose?"
  
---
Are they satisfactory women
---
?" she
 inquired softly of Henery Fray.
  
---
Yielding women?" as
 scarlet a pair as ever was!"
---
" said a woman in the
 back quarter, who had just entered with clicking pattens.
  
---
" What woman is that?"
---
Bathsheba asked.
  
---
This lady
 called herself five- and- twenty,.
---
She was a woman who never,
 like some newly married, showed conjugal tenderness in
 public, perhaps because she had none to show.
  
---
said Bathsheba.
---
"" said again the shrill tongue
 of Laban's lawful wife.
  
---
" the wife replied
  " Heh- heh- heh!"
---
"" said Bathsheba,
.

---
" Oh, mem, his pore mother, not being a
 Scripture- read woman
---
she cried her heart out about it almost.
---
She was

---
But perhaps her air was
 the inevitable result of the social rise which had advanced
 her from a cottage to a large house and fields.
---
" And what's the news?" said Bathsheba, as William,
 after marching to the middle of the hall,.

---
?" said Bathsheba.

---
Well, ma'am, in round numbers, she's run away with
 the soldiers.
---
she's gone after him
---
said Bathsheba.
---
She then rose; but
---
to which her
 mourning dress added a soberness that was hardly to
 be found in the words themselves
---
that
 because I'm a woman I do n't understand the difference
 between bad goings- on and good
---
her black silk dress licking
 up a few straws and
---
biddy, elevating her feelings
 to the occasion from a sense of grandeur, floated off
 behind Bathsheba with a milder dignity not entirely
 free from travesty, and
---
What
 girl are you?"

---
" Your wife, Fanny Robin."
" Fanny!" said the wall, in utter astonishment.

---
" Yes." said the girl, with a half- suppressed gasp of
 emotion.

---
There was something in the woman's tone which is
 not that of the wife, and
---
There are bad women about, and
---
When she passed the
 corner a subdued exclamation was heard inside the
 wall.

---
no more
 was her appearance the following market- day in
---
Among these heavy yeomen a feminine figure glided,
 the single one of her sex that the room contained.
---
She
 was.
---
She moved
 between them as a chaise between carts,,
---
It had required a little
 determination-- far more than she had at first imagined
 -- to take up a position here, for at her first entry the
 lumbering dialogues had ceased
---
, nearly every face had
 been turned towards her, and.

---
to these she had made her
 way.
---
if she was
---
she had

---
But to be the practical woman intended to show herself, business must be carried on,
 introductions or none, and
---
she ultimately acquired con-
 fidence enough to speak and reply boldly to men merely
 known to her by hearsay.
---
Bathsheba too had her
 sample- bags, and by degrees adopted the professional
 pour into the hand-- holding up the grains in her narrow
 palm for inspection, in perfect Casterbridge manner.

---
when, with parted lips, she somewhat
 defiantly turned up her face
---
But her eyes
 had a softness-- invariably a softness-- which, had they
 not been dark, would have seemed mistiness
---
piercing to simple clearness Strange to say of a woman in full bloom and vigor,
 she always allowed.
---
her interlocutors to finish their state-
 ments before rejoining with hers
---
In arguing on prices,
 she held to.
---
But there was an elasticity in her firmness
 which removed it from obstinacy, as there was a naivete
 in her cheapening which saved it from meanness.

---
with whom she had no dealings
 by far the greater part
---
Who is she?
---
Farmer Everdene's niece; took on Weatherbury
 Upper Farm."

---
she'll do
 everything herself
---
" Yes,' tis a pity she's so headstrong."
---
to be proud of her here-- she
 lightens up the old place.'
---
that she'll soon get picked up
---
that the novelty of
 her engagement in such an occupation had almost as
 much to do with the magnetism
---
this Saturday's debut in the forum, whatever
 it may have been to Bathsheba
---
Indeed, the sensation was so pronounced that
 her instinct on two or three occasions was merely to
 walk as a queen among these gods of the fallow, like a
 little sister of a little Jove, and to neglect closing prices
 altogether.

---
The numerous evidences of- her power to attract were
 only thrown into greater relief by a marked exception.

---
Women seem.
---
Bathsheba, without looking within
 a right angle of him, was conscious of a black sheep
 among the flock.

---
It perplexed her first.
---
If nobody had regarded her
---
, she would
 have--.
---
, she would
 have taken it as a matter of course--
---
She soon knew thus much of the recusant's appear-
 ance.
---
Bathsheba was convinced.

---
, she rushed off to Liddy,
-- beside the yellowing in which
 they had driven to town.
---
who was waiting for her
---
on they trotted Bathsheba's sugar,,
---
Liddy said"."

---
" The information was put
 in this form that Liddy might not for a moment
---
her mistress was
---
she continued,"
---
Liddy could n't think.

---
said Bathsheba with some
 disappointment.

---
Bathsheba was suffering from the reverse feeling just
 then, and
---
" she said.

---
Liddy looked."
---
as if Bathsheba and her charms
 were thin air
---
?" she
 remarked.

---
" replied Liddy.

---
A woman jilted him
---
Dinner being over, Bathsheba,
 for want of a better companion
---
Bathsheba's new piano,, looked particularly sloping and out
 of level on the warped floor.
---
Liddy, like a little brook, though
 shallow, was always rippling
---
; her presence had not so
 much weight.

---
Liddy looking at it said,--
"?
---
said Bathsheba,.
---
Liddy fetched it.
---
" she
 said, on returning.
---
The special verse in the Book of Ruth was sought out
 by Bathsheba, and
---
the sublime words met her eye.
---
Folly in the
 concrete blushed, persisted in her intention, and.
---
said Bathsheba.

---
Bathsheba blushed guiltily.

---
" said Liddy curiously.

---
her thoughts had taken
---
" No, indeed." said Bathsheba, with serene indifference
"."

---
Liddy assumed a smaller physiognomy, and.

---
" Bathsheba said perforce.

---
Bathsheba dropped into a silence intended to ex-
 press.

---
that she had opinions on the matter too abstruse
 for Liddy's comprehension, rather than
---
that she had
 nothing to say
---
" she exclaimed at length.

---
"" said Liddy.
---
It was the single name among all possible wrong
 ones that just at this moment seemed to Bathsheba
 more pertinent than the right.

---
Bathsheba took from her desk a gorgeously illumin-
 ated and embossed design in post- octavo, which had
 been" bought on the previous market- day at the chief
 stationer's in Casterbridge.
---
"" said Bathsheba.
---
, returned
 Liddy promptly: --
" The rose is red
---
said Bathsheba.
---
She inserted the
 words in a small though legible handwriting
---
" to send it to the stupid old
 Boldwood" said the
 irrepressible Liddy,.

---
as she thought
 of the moral and social magnitude of the man contem-
 plated
---
Bathsheba paused.

---
She was far from being
 seriously concerned about his nonconformity.
---
that a girl like Liddy should talk about it
---
So
 Liddy's idea was at first.

---
said the persistent Liddy.

---
said Bathsheba, idly.
---
Bathsheba, a small yawn upon her mouth, took the
 pen, and.

---
Bathsheba looked
 closely at the hot wax.
"
---
" she exclaimed,.
---
Bathsheba had a fair knowledge
---
;
 but of love subjectively she knew nothing.





---
upon
 the eagle's wings was the letter Bathsheba had sent.

Somebody's
 some woman's-- hand had travelled softly over the
 paper

as she formed it
---
Why should
 she have imagined him?

Her mouth-- were the lips
 red or pale, plump or creased?--

the woman writing,

She was a
 misty shape, and

well she might be,.

that
 her original was at that moment

she took a form, and com-

---
It is for Miss Everdene's.
---
And how is she getting on without a baily?
---
" She'll rue it-- surely, surely!"
---
she can carr' on alone
---
what she is
---
what's
 under her bonnet
---
She can
 spaik real language, and.

what a farmer- woman can want with a
 harpsichord, dulcimer, pianner, or whatever' tis

" What have you been saying about her?"

her have rope enough

you've been speaking against her

that
 she's no worse

As to
 shepherd, there, I'm sure mis'ess ought to have made
 ye her baily-- such a fitting man for't as you be."

At the same
 time, Miss Everdene has a right to be own baily and.

if
 she choose--

And she do n't even let

she's took against ye-- that

ALL SOULS'


 ON a week- day morning a small congregation, con-
 sisting mainly of women and girls, rose from its knees
 in the mouldy nave of a church called All Saints', in
 the distant barrack- town before mentioned, at the end
 of a service without a sermon.
---
Where's the woman?
---
where the woman is
---
The women threw off their
 nervousness, and
---
The women were impressed, and
---
; every
 woman in the church was waiting, and

---
" Shall?" she asked blankly.
"
---
" she expostulated in a trembling voice,
"
---
When women are in a freakish
 mood, their usual intuition, either from carelessness or
 inherent defect
---
that Bathsheba was fated
---
To Bold-
 wood women had been remote phenomena rather than
 necessary complements--.

---
Was she really beautiful?
---
Miss Everdene considered
 handsome?
---
O yes; she was a good deal.
---
she came
---
And this charming woman had
---
" Why should she have done that
 strange thing?
---
well matched
 by Bathsheba's insensibility to the possibly great issues
 of little beginnings
---
She was at this moment, ently as if his face had been the pages of a ledger.
---
that such a nature as his had no attraction
 for a woman of Bathsheba's taste
---
This could be done, but only
 in one way-- by asking to see a sample of her corn.

---
All this time Bathsheba was conscious of having
.
---
His
 eyes, she knew
---
such a
 triumph would have been the sweeter to her for this
 piquing delay.
---
she valued it.

---
only as she
 valued an artificial flower or a wax fruit
---
Being a woman with some good sense in reasoning
 on subjects wherein her heart was not involved, Bath-
 sheba genuinely repented.

---
which had owed
 its existence as much to Liddy as to herself
---
she respected too highly
---
She that day nearly formed the intention of begging
 his pardon on the very next occasion of their meeting.

---
she ridiculed him,
---
she wanted
---
, it would read
 like additional evidence of her forwardness.





---
Bathsheba was far from dreaming.
---
upon which she had
---
Had she known
 Boldwood's moods
---
, her blame would have been fearful,
 and the stain upon her heart ineradicable.
---
Moreover,
 had she known her present power for good or evil over
 this man.

---
, she would have trembled at her responsibility
---
Luckily for her present, unluckily for her future tran-
 quillity, her understanding had not yet told her.
---
Beyond the first enclosure
 was a hedge, and on the other side of this a meadow
 belonging to Bathsheba's farm.

---
They were those of Miss Everdene,
 Shepherd Oak, and Cainy Ball.

---
as the she ll
---
No mother existed, no sister for his tenderness, no
 idle ties for sense.
---
whenever
 an ewe has lost her own offspring,
---
one of the twins of
 another ewe being given her as a substitute
---
whilst Bathsheba was holding open a little pen of four
 hurdles, into which the Mother and foisted lamb
---
Bathsheba looked up at the completion of the
 manouvre, and.
---
Gabriel,
 to whom her face was as the uncertain glory of an April
 day,.
---
As for Bathsheba, she was not deceived into the
 belief that Farmer Boldwood had walked by on business
 or in idleness.
---
She collected the probabilities of the
 case, and.
---
that she was herself responsible for
 Boldwood's appearance there
---
her much
 to see
---
Bathsheba was no schemer for marriage, nor

---
was she deliberately a trifler with the affections of men,
 and
---
a censor's experience on seeing an actual flirt after
 observing her would have been a feeling of surprise
 that Bathsheba could be so different from such a one,
 and.

---
She resolved never again, by look or by sign,.
---
She was
 not at home.
---
The great aids
 to idealization in love were present here:  occasional
 observation of her from a distance, and the absence of
 social intercourse with her-- visual familiarity, oral
 strangeness.
---
that sorry household realities appertained to
 her
---
that she, like all others, had moments of
 commonplace
---
whilst she still lived
 and, a troubled creature
 like himself
---
On inquiring for her at her house they had

---
she was at the sheepwashing, and
---
Bathsheba was standing by in a new riding- habit--
 the most elegant she had ever worn-- the reins of her
 horse being looped over her arm.
---
that she could not but think
---
bade her good- morning, with
 such constraint stepped across to the washing for its own sake, hoping
 not to find her there; more, she fancied his brow severe
 and his eye slighting.
---
Bathsheba immediately contrived
, and.
---
till she was
 a stone's throw off
---
She heard, and.
---
that love was encircling
 her
---
Instead of turning or waiting,
 Bathsheba went further among the high sedges, but

---
Here,
 without being seen, they could hear the splashing and
 shouts of the washers above.
" Miss Everdene!"
---
She trembled,."

---
she had

---
so did Bathsheba's at her intuitive
 conviction.

---
Bathsheba tried, and
---
she made
---
Beyond all things, I want you as my wife."

---
"" she stammered.

---
Bathsheba answered nothing, and
---
the mare upon
 her arm seemed so impressed that instead of cropping
 the herbage she looked up.

---
Bathsheba's momentary impulse at hearing this was
.

---
that, till she remembered
---
I want you for my
 wife--
---
" she
 said to herself, but not a word to him.
  
---
-- it was a
 wanton thing which no woman with any self- respect
 should have done.
---
She allowed a very small
 smile, and
---
live quite at ease, Miss
 Everdene
---
Bathsheba's heart was young, and
---
She was.
  
---
And then she turned away.
---
Bathsheba mused.

---
It was one
 which many women of her own station in the neighbour-
 hood, and not a few of higher rank
---
that she, a lonely girl, should marry, and
---
Had she felt,
---
which she did
 not, any wish whatever for the married state in the
 abstract
---
, she could not reasonably have rejected him,
.
---
who frequently appealed to her under,

---
: she esteemed
 and
---
she did not want him.
---
that ordinary women
 accept husbands
---
But the understood incentive
 on the woman's part was wanting here.
---
But a disquiet filled her.
---
which was somewhat to her
 credit,
---
with which she combated her objections
---
Beyond the reasons,
 she had a strong feeling that, having been the one who
 began the game, she ought in honesty to accept the conse-
 quences.
---
She said in the
 same breath.

---
that she could n't do it
---
Bathsheba's was an impulsive nature under a delibera-
 tive aspect. 
---
An Elizabeth in brain and a Mary Stuart
 in spirit, she often performed actions of the greatest
 temerity with a manner of extreme discretion.
---
Many of
 her thoughts were perfect syllogisms
---
The next day to that of the declaration she found
 Gabriel Oak at the bottom of her garden,.
---
looked upon them in
 silence for a minute or two; then she said--

---
Bathsheba took the handle.

---
Bathsheba turned
 the winch, and
---
Bathsheba felt
 the unpleasant symptoms.
  "
---
she said.
---
Bathsheba then began, with some
 awkwardness,.
  
---
her thoughts to stray occasion-
 ally from her story
---
exclaimed Bathsheba.
---
?" she said again.

---
" she
 continued.

---
" Well, then, Bathsheba!" said.
  
---
" Miss Everdene,," she said, with dignity.
  
---
Bathsheba regarded him with round- eyed perplexity.

---
She did not know.
  
---
she mur-
 with a slight decline in her assurance.

---
if you wish, Miss Everdene
---
With Bathsheba a hastened act was a rash act;
 but,
---
that she valued as sounder than her own
---
, she asked
 the question, painful.
---
as she must have known
---
Such is the selfishness of some charm-
 ing women.
---
Perhaps it was some excuse for her thus
 torturing honesty to her own advantage, that she had
 absolutely no other sound judgment within easy reach.

---
she
 said, quietly.

---
That it is unworthy of any thoughtful, and meek,
 and comely woman."

---
But she forbore
, and
---
the reticence of her tongue
 only made the loquacity of her face the more notice-
 able.

---
She instantly replied sarcastically--
"!"

---
Bathsheba had unmistakably
 lost her temper,
---
She then broke out--
  
---
" she
 said;
---
that she expected an unhesitating denial of
 this supposition
---
A woman may be treated with a bitterness which
 is sweet to her, and with a rudeness which is not
 offensive.
---
Bathsheba would have submitted to an
 indignant chastisement for her levity
---
what she had been expecting
---
what she had not
 got
---
because the lecturer saw her in
 the cold morning light of open- shuttered disillusion

---
Bathsheba laid down the shears.
 
---
" she exclaimed.
---
it was
 a fact-- that when Bathsheba was swayed by an emotion
 of an earthly sort her lower lip trembled: when by a
 refined emotion, her upper or heavenward one
---
Her
 nether lip quivered now.
"
---
she, her
 eyes flashing at
---
"?" she said,.

---
just as she was coming out on her
 way to church
---
with which she had

---
With Bathsheba it was a moment
---
With Bathsheba it was a moment.
---
Moreover, she had

---
which she had suffered from Oak's remarks
---
she cried,.
---
Her eyes were at their darkest and brightest now.

---
Bathsheba's beauty belonged rather to the demonian
 than to the angelic school
---
, she never looked so well as
.

---
when she was angry-- and
---
that her presence
 always gave them
---
Bathsheba, with a sad, bursting heart, looked at these
 primest specimens of her prime flock.

---
said Bathsheba,
 helplessly.
---
" she said,
---
" How dare you name that man in my presence!" she
 said excitedly.
---
she added, brighten-
!"
  
---
she stood alone with the dying flock.

---
" she said firmly.

---
Bathsheba went up to it.
---
" she again
 exclaimed,.
---
The" No, I
 wo n't" of Bathsheba meant virtually,"."

---
She followed her assistants through the gate, and
.
---
Laban answered to her
 signal.

---
Bathsheba watched.
---
Bathsheba walked
 up and down.
---
Bathsheba continued.
---
She hoped
---
" O, what folly!" said Bathsheba.

---
" she said.

---
Well?" said Bathsheba, unwilling to believe that
 her verbal lettre- de- cachet could possibly have miscarried.

---
Bathsheba turned aside, her eyes full of tears.
---
she was in through pride and shrewishness
---
: she burst out
---
she attempted no further concealment.

---
Bathsheba checked her grief and.

---
" she
 murmured.
---
After this collapse, not very dignified for the head
 of an establishment, she went into the house, Tall at
 her heels.
---
Here she sat down and.
---
She held it at a distance,
---
She looked a little redder in refolding it, and.
---
Bathsheba waited indoors for the result
---
at which she had

---
although her first
 command had been so haughty
---
She went out.
---
A mounted figure passed between her and the
 sky, and.
---
when a woman's eyes and tongue tell
 distinctly opposite tales
---
Bathsheba looked full of
 gratitude, and
---
she said:--
  "
---
She knew from the look.
---
Bathsheba followed to the
 field.

---
,
 Bathsheba came and.
"
---
" she, said,
,.

---
And she smiled on him again.





---
" Behind all was Bathsheba,.
---
Bathsheba, after throwing a glance here, a caution
 there, and lecturing one of the younger operators who
 had allowed his last finished sheep to go off among
 the flock without re- stamping it with her initials
---
She blushes at the insult."
---
murmured Bathsheba,
 watching the pink flush which arose and overspread
 the neck and shoulders of the ewe where they were
 left bare by the clicking shears-- a flush which was
 enviable, for its delicacy, by many queens of coteries,
 and would have been creditable, for its promptness, to
 any woman in the world.

---
So the chatter was all on her side.
---
There is a
 loquacity that tells nothing, which was Bathsheba's;
 and
---
!" said Bathsheba,
 looking at her watch as the last snip.

---
that she was going
---
which Bathsheba's
 presence had somewhat suppressed
---
she instinctively modulated her
 own to the same pitch, and
---
She was far from having
 a wish to appear mysteriously connected with him; but

---
woman at the impressionable age gravitates to the larger
 body not only in her choice of words, which is apparent
 every day, but even in her shades of tone and humour,
.
  
---
The issue of their dialogue
 was the taking of her hand by the courteous farmer.
---
Bathsheba demurely regarded a contemptible straw in a way which suggested less ovine
 criticism than womanly embarrassment.
---
She became
 more or less red in the cheek, the blood wavering in
 uncertain flux and reflux over the sensitive space between
 ebb and flood.
---
She left Boldwood's side, and
---
Then she
 reappeared in her new riding- habit of myrtle- green, which
 fitted her to the waist as a rind
---
; Bathsheba
 instantly gazed towards it, and.
"
---
" she exclaimed, with severe remon-
 strance you who are so strict with the other men--!"

---
that she herself was the cause of the poor
 ewe's wound
---
because she had wounded the ewe's shearer
 in a-- still more vital part
---
she again spoke out to Oak
 with the same dominative and tantalizing graciousness.

---
why a maid should take a
 husband
---
when she's bold enough to fight her own
 battles, and
---
As usual with decided characters, Bathsheba invari-
 ably provoked the criticism of individuals like Henery
 Fray.
---
Her emblazoned fault was.
---
" I
 once hinted my mind to her on a few things, as nearly
 as.
---
That was n't too strong for her
---
that she could
 understand my meaning,
---
her
 marry
---
an she will
---
Because she told me all that passed.
---
Bathsheba
 had shown indications of anointing him above his
 fellows by installing him as the bailiff that the farm
 imperatively required.
---
Far from coquetting with
 Boldwood, she had trifled with himself in thus feigning
 that she had trifled with another.
---
Miss Everdene sat inside
 the window,.
---
She was thus at
 the head without mingling with the men.

---
This evening Bathsheba was unusually excited, her
 red cheeks and lips contrasting lustrously with the mazy
 skeins of her shadowy hair.
---
She seemed, and
---
the seat at the bottom of the table was
 at her request left vacant until after they had begun
 and the duties appertaining to that end,.

---
she," will you move again, please,
 and
---
" Faith, so she is
---
" Now, Joseph, your song, please." said Bathsheba,
 from the window.

---
Bathsheba still remained enthroned
 inside the window, and
---
from which she sometimes looked up.
---
thinking of this, Liddy brought candles into the back
 part of the room overlooking the shearers, and
---
Bathsheba's form, still in its original position, was now
 again.

---
distinct between their eyes and the light, was sitting near her
---
Would Miss
 Everdene sing to them the song she always sang so
 charmingly--" The Banks of Allan Water"--?

---
After a moment's consideration Bathsheba assented,
.

---
"?" she whispered.

---
She stood up in the window- opening,, the candles behind her, Gabriel on her right hand,
 immediately outside the sash- frame.
---
Her singing
 was soft and rather tremulous at first, but
---
that her
 breathing could almost be heard between the bars; and

---
when they regarded
 her
---
Bathsheba then wished them good- night,.
---
produced by Bathsheba's
 voice
---
Miss Everdene and Boldwood were alone.
---
Her
 cheeks had lost a great deal of their healthful fire from
 the very seriousness of her position; but
---
her eye was
 bright with the excitement of a triumph--.

---
She was standing behind a low arm- chair,.
---
from which
 she had just risen, and
---
she derived from the
 proof that she was idolized
---
" she was saying, in a trembling
 voice quite unlike her usual self- confidence.
---
, I shall be
 able to promise to be your wife.
---
" she said, firmly."
---
" she said, graciously-- almost tenderly;
 and.

---
Bathsheba knew more of him now
---
She had been awe-
, and
---
she was schooling herself.
---
To have
 brought all this about her ears; but.
---
with which even the most timid woman some-
 times acquire a relish for the dreadful
---
which Bathsheba had

---
Women are never tired of bewailing man's
 fickleness in love, but
---
As watching is best done invisibly, she usually carried
 a dark lantern in her hand, and.
---
This cool-
 ness may have owed its existence not so much to her
 fearlessness of expected danger as to her freedom from
 the suspicion of any
---
her worst anticipated discovery
 being
---
she went round to the farm paddock.
---
Then the munching would
 recommence,, very clammy and humid on their sur-
 faces, not exactly pleasant to the touch; the mouths beneath having a great
 partiality for closing upon any loose end of Bathsheba's
 apparel which came within reach of their tongues.

---
before starting, her apprehen-
 sions of danger were not vivid enough to lead her to
 take a companion.
---
Slipping along here covertly as
 Time, Bathsheba fancied.
---
she could hear
---
Her own instantly fell as gently as
 snowflakes.
---
She reassured herself by a remembrance

---
; regetting, at
 the same time, that the meeting should be about to
 occur in the darkest point of her route, even though
 only just outside her own door.

---
a figure was
 apparently on the point of gliding past her.
---
when some-
 thing tugged at her skirt and
---
The instantaneous check nearly threw Bath-
 sheba off her balance.
---
In recovering she struck against
 warm clothes and buttons.

---
" A rum start, upon my soul!" said a masculine voice,
 a foot or so above her head.
---
" No." said Bathsheba.

---
" Are you a woman?"

---
Bathsheba softly tugged again, but to no purpose.

---
, the
 rays burst out from their prison, and Bathsheba beheld
 her position with astonishment.

---
to whom she was hooked
---
The contrast of this
 revelation with her anticipations of some sinister figure
 in sombre garb was so great that it had upon her the
 effect of a fairy transformation.

---
she hastily replied,
 and.

---
when she raised them
 for a moment
---
; Bathsheba looked down again, for his
 gaze.
---
But she had obliquely noticed.

---
Bathsheba pulled again.

---
" she exclaimed, helplessly
---
She withdrew her own hand, but,
---
Bathsheba was
 vexed
---
; she hardly knew why.

---
She looked at him again.

---
she replied, stiffly, and.
---
as she could infuse into
 a position of captivity

---
She pulled again,
 and
---
the gathers of her dress began.

---
But why should such a fair and dutiful girl have such
 an aversion to her father's sex?"

---
she exclaimed, in high
 temper.
---
She closed her lips in a determined silence.

---
Bathsheba was revolving in her mind whether by a
 bold and desperate rush
---
she could free herself at the
 risk of leaving her skirt bodily behind her.
---
which she had

---
The dress-- put on to appear stately at the supper-- was the head
 and front of her wardrobe
---
; not another in her stock
 became her so well.
---
What woman in Bathsheba's
 position, not naturally timid, and within call of her
 retainers, would have bought escape from a dashing
 soldier at so dear a price?

---
said her cool friend.

---
" It is done in order that I may have the pleasure
 of apologizing to so charming a woman, which I
 straightway do most humbly, madam.
---
Bathsheba really knew.

---
" I've seen a good many women in my time.
---
more
 thoughtfully than hitherto, critically regarding her bent
 head at the same time;" but I've never seen a woman
 so beautiful as you
---
She started up, and
---
that
 was her difficulty now
---
She sidled off inch by inch,
 the lantern in her hand,.

---
till she could see the redness
 of his coat no longer
---
She made no reply, and,,.

---
Liddy had just retired to rest.
---
In ascending to her
 own chamber, Bathsheba opened the girl's door an
 inch or two, and,
---
Liddy, is any soldier staying in the village--
 sergeant somebody-- rather gentlemanly for a sergeant,
 and-- a red coat with blue facings
---
There are
 occasions when girls like Bathsheba will put up with
 a great deal of unconventional behaviour.
---
Just now the first
 feeling was in the ascendant with Bathsheba, with a dash
 of the second.
---
So she could not clearly decide."

---
whether it was her
 opinion that he had insulted her or not
---
" Was ever anything so odd!" she at last exclaimed
 to herself, in her own room.
---
Clearly she
 did not think his barefaced praise of her person an
 insult now.

---
she was beautiful
---
to
 women lied like a Cretan--.

---
The wondrous power of flattery in passados at woman
 is a perception so universal as to be remarked upon by
 many people almost as automatically as they repeat a
 proverb, or say that they are Christians and the like,
 without thinking much of the enormous corollaries
 which spring from the proposition.
---
who by deluging her with untenable
 fictions charms the female wisely
---
A week or two
 after the shearing, Bathsheba, feeling a nameless relief
 of spirits on account of Boldwood's absence, approached
 her hayfields and.
---
as she had entered the field
---
Bathsheba
 blushed with half- angry embarrassment, and.





---
" And I would rather have curses from you than
 kisses from any other woman; so."

---
Bathsheba was absolutely speechless.
---
And yet she
 could not help.

---
she said,
.
---
that you are
 quite a common- place woman
---
exclaimed
 Bathsheba,
---
if you pretty women had n't made
 me an idolater
---
Bathsheba moved on.
---
" she said, in a restless state between distress
 at hearing him and a penchant to hear more.

---
you are a most fascinating woman
---
" she femininely
 murmured.

---
"" she replied evasively.

---
" Not so to you:  then I say with all respect that, if
 so, it is owing to your modesty, Miss Everdene.
---
" she went on,
.

---
herself to be further lured into a conversation
 that intention had rigorously forbidden
---
Liddy say
,
---
" She paused
---
Her tone and mien signified beyond
 mistake
---
" How-- indeed?" she said,.

---
She can marry him:

---
Such women as
 you a hundred men always covet--.
---
that a woman so charming as yourself, Miss Ever-
 dene, is hardly a blessing to her race
---
she made no reply
---
she said simply.

---
she replied, and
---
there was even a little tremu-
 lousness in the usually cool girl's voice;"!"
---
And
 then poor Bathsheba instantly perceived her slip in
 making this admission
---
: in hastily trying to retrieve it,
 she went from bad to worse."
---
Bathsheba, looking askance at a reed she was
---
" said the shrewd
 woman, in painfully innocent earnest.
---
Well, perhaps generosity is not a woman's
 most marked characteristic."

---
"?" she asked, with
 some interest.

---
" Can you ask Miss Everdene--?"

---
" she uncertainly and
 doubtingly answered.
---
I do Miss Everdene,
 care for it.
---
" she
 said,.
---
Bathsheba surveyed him curiously, from the feet
 upward, as high as she liked to venture her glance,
.

---
" she said demurely.

---
before she knew
---
And intending, a heavy gold watch was in her hand.

---
She did so.

---
"
 she exclaimed, with round- eyed wonder.
---
which she held out persistently towards him
---
Bathsheba followed.

---
she said, in a perfect
 simmer of distress.
---
Bathsheba was brimming with agitated bewilderment,
 and
---
she said, in half- suspicious accents of feeling,"
---
as she now stood--
 excited, wild, and honest as the day-- 
---
she
 went on, unconscious of the transmutation
---
she was
.

---
Bathsheba could not face the haymakers now.
---
Her
 heart erratically flitting hither and thither from per-
 plexed excitement, hot, and almost tearful
---
, she retreated
 homeward,!
---
even Liddy had left the house for the
 purpose of lending a hand
---
-- Bathsheba resolved to hive
 the bees herself, if possible.
---
She had dressed the hive
 with herbs and honey,
---
crook, made herself impregnable with armour of leather
 gloves, straw hat, and large gauze veil-- once green but
.
---
At once she heard, not ten yards off,
 a voice that was beginning to have a strange power in
 agitating her.
"
---
Bathsheba flung down the brush, crook, and empty
 hive,.
---
as she could

---
she reached the
 bottom
---
She found her voice in a minute.
---
" she asked, in what, for a
 defiant girl,;
---
was a faltering way though, for a timid
 girl, it would have seemed a brave way enough.

---
as she was
---
, she could not avoid
---
She made use of an unobserved minute
.
---
To hide her embarrassment during the unwonted
 process of untying the string about his neck, she said: --
"."

---
Bathsheba hesitated.
---
She had heard wondrous
 reports from time to time by dwellers in Weatherbury,
* tlie sword- exercise.
---
So she said mildly.

---
what she felt strongly
---
" O no, indeed!" said Bathsheba, blushing.
---
She shook her head, but with a weakened negation.

---
" she said,".
---
I must bring Liddy too
---
An unconscious look of assent in Bathsheba's eyes
 betrayed.
---
her also feel
---
that Liddy Would be superfluous in
 the suggested scene
---
She had felt it, even whilst making
 the proposal.

---
Well, I wo n't bring Liddy-- and
---
she added;" a very short
 time."

---
Bathsheba's dwelling extended, a
 mile off, into an uncultivated tract of land,
---
Bathsheba appeared in their midst, up to her shoulders.
---
She
 paused,.

---
whence she cast a farewell glance upon
 the spot she had just left,
---
She saw a dim spot of artificial red moving round
 the shoulder of the rise.
---
She waited one minute-- two minutes-- thought of
 Troy's disappointment at her non- fulfilment of a promised
 engagement,.
---
till she again ran along the field,
---
She
 was now
---
literally trembling and panting at this her
 temerity in such an errant undertaking; her breath
 came and
---
her eyes shone with an in-
 frequent light.
---
she must
---
She reached the
 verge of a pit in the middle of the ferns.
---
Bathsheba saw a sort of rainbow, upside down in
 the air, and
---
She hurriedly interrupted: !"

---
she said invincibly.

---
Bathsheba's adventurous spirit was beginning.

---
She took up her position.

---
she was
 conscious
---
that the point and blade of the sword
 were darting with a gleam towards her left side, just
 above her hip;
---
as it were from between her ribs,
---
she cried out in affright,.
---
In an instant the atmosphere was transformed to
 Bathsheba's eyes.
---
Beams of light caught from the low
 sun's rays, above, around, in front of her, well- nigh shut
 out earth and heaven--.
---
In short, she was enclosed in a firmament
 of light, and of sharp hisses,.

---
the space
 left untouched would have been almost a mould of
 Bathsheba's figure.

---
Behind the luminous streams of this aurora militaris,
 she could see the hue of Troy's sword arm, spread in a
 scarlet haze over the space covered by its motions, like
 a twanged harpstring, and behind all Troy himself,
 mostly facing her.
---
she could see them individually.
---
before she had moved or
---
An arc of silver shone on her right side: the sword
 had descended.
---
"" she
 cried.

---
She saw the point glisten towards her bosom,
 and.
---
Bathsheba closed her eyes in
 the full persuasion.
---
that she was killed at last
---
just as usual, she opened them again
---
said Bathsheba, amazed.

---
She shuddered.
---
Bathsheba,, abstractedly sat down on
 a tuft of heather.

---
She saw.
---
She felt power-
 less.
---
Bathsheba seemed as one who, facing
 a reviving wind, finds it blow so strongly that it stops
 the breath.

---
A minute later and she saw.

---
That minute's interval had brought the blood, if aflame to the very
 hollows of her feet, and enlarged emotion to a compass
 which quite swamped thought.
---
It had brought upon
 her a stroke resulting,-- here a stream of tears.
---
She felt like
 one who has sinned a great sin.

---
the element of folly distinctly mingling
 with the many varying particulars which made up the
 character of Bathsheba Everdene
---
It was almost foreign
 to her intrinsic nature.
---
Introduced as lymph on the
 dart of Eros, it eventually permeated and coloured
 her whole constitution.
---
though she had too
 much understanding to be entirely governed by her
 womanliness
---
Perhaps in no
 minor point does woman astonish her helpmate more
 than in the strange power she possesses of believing
 cajoleries that she knows to be false-- except, indeed, in
 that of being utterly sceptical on strictures that she
 knows to be true.

---
Bathsheba loved Troy in the way that only self- reliant
 women love when they abandon their self- reliance.

---
When a strong woman recklessly throws away her
 strength
---
she is worse than a weak woman who has never
 had any strength to throw away.
---
One source of her
 inadequacy is the novelty of the occasion.
---
She has
 never had practice in making the best of such a
 condition.
---
Bathsheba was not conscious of guile in this matter.

---
her utmost thoughts in this direction been by herself)
---
as that she felt
 her impulses
---
Her love was entire as a child's, and
---
Her culpability lay in
 her making no attempt to control feeling by subtle and
 careful inquiry into consciences.
---
She could show others
 the steep and thorny way, but' reck'd not her own rede,"

---
mark-
 edly shown in her conduct
---
Bathsheba had spoken of
 her interest in Boldwood with the greatest freedom to
 Liddy, but
---
she had only communed with her own heart
".

---
that Bathsheba was getting into the toils

---
when she had

---
her pass
---
?" she said.
---
when
 she had brushed somewhat quickly by him
---
She walked on without turning her head,
 and
---
for many steps nothing further was heard from her
 quarter than the rustle of her dress against the heavy
 corn- ears.
---
Then she resumed rather tartly--
"."

---
" she returned quickly.

---
Bathsheba would probably have terminated the con-
 versation there and
---
she said
 very emphatically,".
---
Bathsheba's steps became faintly spasmodic.
---
"
 she asked.
"
---
she said,
---
what is mirth to the neighbours
 is ruin to the woman.
---
as did Bathsheba now
---
she exclaimed desperately.
---
she said eagerly,".
---
how entirely she trusted him
---
" Do n't, do n't, do n't!" she exclaimed, in a choking
 voice.

---
she
 could not really forgive him for letting his wish to marry
.

---
her be eclipsed by his wish to do her good, any more
 than for his slighting treatment of Troy
---
she commanded, a
 paleness of face invisible to the eye being suggested by
 the trembling words.
---
" she said decisively.

---
who she is that I
 like
---
At any rate she murmured something to the
 effect.
---
She said?
---
I ask it as a woman, and.
---
" Certainly I will, Miss Everdene." said Gabriel, gently.

---
her to get far ahead of him
---
A figure apparently rose
 from the earth beside her.
---
Bathsheba entered her own house.

---
There burnt upon her face.
---
when she met the light of
 the candles the flush and excitement which were little
 less than chronic with her now
---
who had accompanied her to the very door
---
It is only fair to Bathsheba after-

---
-- she had

---
that she had dismissed Oak,
---
She now sank down into a chair, wild and perturbed
 by all these new and fevering sequences.
---
Then she
 jumped up with a manner of decision, and.

---
In three minutes, without pause or modification, she
 had written a letter to Boldwood, at his address beyond
 Casterbridge,
---
that she had
---
; that her
 final decision was.
---
that she could not marry him
---
She
 had expressed to Oak an intention to wait.
---
But Bathsheba found.

---
that she could not wait
---
It was impossible;
 yet to quell her uneasiness by getting it out of her hands,
 and so, as it were, setting the act in motion at once, she
 arose to take it to any one of the women who might be
 in the kitchen.

---
She paused in the passage.
---
Bathsheba and Troy were the
 subject of it.

---
", she'll gie up farming."

---
Bathsheba had too much sense to mind seriously
 what her servitors said about her; but.
---
She
 burst in upon them.

---
"?" she asked.

---
At last
 Liddy said frankly,"."

---
said Liddy;"
---
said Bathsheba, excitedly.

---
But I am a silly woman!
---
She flung down the letter and.

---
" O miss!" said mild Liddy,.
---
Liddy closed the door, and
---
Bathsheba burst out: 
---
Are you a woman yourself?"

---
Liddy's clear eyes rounded with wonderment.

---
"!" she said,
 in reckless abandonment and grief.
---
though perhaps I am enough to frighten
 any innocent woman
---
She put
 her arms round Liddy's neck.
---
that a woman
 thinks nothing of perjury
---
Liddy went towards the door.
"
---
She
 started off,.

---
said
 Liddy,.

---
" what to say, miss said Liddy, be-
.
---
she moaned, in a relaxed, desultory
 way, heedless of Liddy's presence."
---
Loving is misery for women
 always.
---
She freshened and.
---
" to repeat anything" said Liddy, with
 womanly dignity of a diminutive order;" but.
---
concluded the small woman, bigly.

---
" said Bathsheba,
 dropping from haughtiness to entreaty with capricious
 inconsequence.
---
Then Bathsheba kissed Liddy, and
---
" she said, a smile shining
 through the moisture.
---
" said Bathsheba,.
---
though somewhat seriously alarmed by this Amazonian
 picture of herself
---
I am not a bold sort of
 maid-- mannish
---
"?" she continued with some anxiety.

---
she
 said, after having drawn her breath very sadly in and
 sent it very sadly out,".'
---
Bathsheba's companion, as a gage of their
 reconciliation, had been granted a week's holiday.
---
that Miss Everdene should honour them by coming
 there for a day or two to inspect some ingenious con-
 trivances which this man of the woods had introduced
 into his wares
---
Leaving her instructions with Gabriel and Maryann,
 to see, she went out of the house just at the close of
 a timely thunder- shower, which had refined the air, and
.
---
Before her, among the
 clouds, there was a contrast in the shape of lairs of
 fierce light which showed themselves in the neighbour-
 hood of a hidden sun,.

---
She had walked nearly two miles of her journey,
.
---
when she beheld
---
she sought so anxiously
---
That Bathsheba was
 a firm and positive girl, far less inconsequent than her
 fellows
---
that these qualities would lead her, and
---
" she faltered, a guilty
 warmth pulsing in her face.

---
she turned a little aside
---
said Bathsheba.

---
She regained self- possession,.

---
"" she
 murmured.
---
Bathsheba was unable to direct her will into any
 definite groove for freeing herself from this fearfully
 and.
---
Still, she is
 you
---
-- she is you."

---
Bathsheba commanded herself well.
---
But she could
 hardly get a clear voice for what came instinctively to
 her lips
---
:" There is little honour to the woman in that
 speech.
---
In her noon- clear sense that she had never
 loved him.

---
she forgot for a moment her thoughtless angle
 on that day in February
---
Bathsheba, you are
 the first woman of any shade or nature that I have ever
 looked at to love, and
---
"!" she
 earnestly said.

---
She checked emotion.
---
Would you have had
 me a woman of clay when you paid me
---
Bathsheba, in spite of her mettle, began.
---
that she was inherently the weaker
 vessel
---
She strove miserably against this feminity
.
---
She had tried any
 trivial object before her eyes, but
---
ingenuity could not save her now.

---
" surely I did not!" she
 answered as heroically as she could.
---
She returned silent and weak denials to his charges,
 and.

---
That
 may be true, somewhat; but ah, Miss Everdene
---
You are not the cold woman
---
The swift music of her heart became hubbub now,
 and
---
she throbbed to extremity.
---
She delayed the reply, but.
---
"." she whispered.

---
I loved a woman once.
---
the woman not
 gained
---
she glided
 from him, without obviously moving,!"

---
as she said,"
---
I am
 only a girl--
---
O, Bathsheba-- this is woman's folly
 indeed!"

---
She fired up at once.
---
" she said, vehemently.
---
The most tragic woman is cowed by a tragic man,
 and
---
, in vehemence and glow,
 nearly her own self rendered into another sex
---
,
 Bathsheba's cheek quivered.
---
She gasped,"!
---
she implored in a miserable cry.
---
Bathsheba,, flung her hands to her face,
 and.
---
what she had seen him
---
The force of the farmer's threats lay in their relation to a
 circumstance known at present only to herself:.
---
her lover was

---
She felt wretchedly certain that if he revisited her just at
 this nick of time, and came into contact with Boldwood, a
 fierce quarrel would be the consequence.
---
She panted with
 solicitude.
---
when she thought of possible injury to Troy
---
being thought a gushing
 girl
---
With almost a morbid dread of, this guileless woman too well concealed from the world
 under a manner of carelessness the warm depths of her strong
 emotions.
---
In fer
 her distraction, instead of advancing further she
 walked up and down,.
---
Then she sat down on a heap of stones by
 the wayside.
---
There she remained long.
---
the unresting world wheeled her round to a contrasting
 prospect eastward, in the shape of indecisive and palpitating
 stars.
---
She gazed upon their silent throes amid the shades of
 space, but.
---
Bathsheba's crannied and mouldy halls were
---
Liddy being,
---
whom Bathsheba had set out
---
, Maryann turned
 in her bed with a sense of being disturbed.
---
She was
 totally unconscious of the nature of the interruption to
 her sleep.
---
She left her bed and.
---
in the paddock she could just discern by
 the uncertain gray a moving figure approaching the
 horse that was feeding there.
---
Here she could see some object which circum-
 stances.

---
They were a woman and a gipsy man.
---
A woman
 was out of the question in such an occupation at this
 hour, and
---
She
 hastily slipped on her clothes,.
---
wen she comes back
---
when she was at home, and
---
what's she between two of us?-if
---
" Old Jimmy Harris only shoed her last week, and

---
, they over-
 drove her at starting
---
how she was

---
" She walked up here--
 and
---
well she might.
---
she had turned her face away
 from the light
---
Bathsheba it certainly was, and
---
she had by this time

---
she could do so well in crises not of love
---
" Well, Gabriel." she inquired quietly,"?"

---
" Bath." she said,.
---
her own
 use the assurance that Gabriel lacked
---
" An important
 matter made it necessary for me to give up my visit to
 liddy, and go off at once.
---
though
 I hammered for ten minutes against her window- sill
---
must n't a lady move an inch from her door without being
 dogged like a thief?"

---
" she said, and.

---
though vexed at first she had
 too much sense
---
She added with a very pretty grace,"."

---
" lt was only a stone in her shoe.
---
She turned her head--
---
as she did so
---
the gateman's candle
 shimmering upon her quick, clear eyes--
 passed through the gate, and
---
" She wo n't be in Bath by no daylight!"

---
Bathsheba's perturbed meditations by the roadside
 had ultimately evolved a conclusion that there were only
 two remedies for the present desperate state of affairs.

---
Could she give up this new love-- could no more speak to him, and beg him, for her good,
 to end his furlough in Bath, and see her and Weather-
 bury no more?

---
for a while she
 contemplated it firmly,.

---
as girls will
---
herself, nevertheless,
, to dwell upon the happy life she would
 have enjoyed
---
; for she had penetrated
 Troy's nature so far as to estimate his tendencies pretty
 accurately
---
She jumped to her feet.
---
She would see him at once.

---
Yes, she would implore him by word of mouth.
---
Was Bathsheba altogether?
---
Or was
 she sophistically sensible, with a thrill of pleasure,
---
that
 by adopting this course for getting rid of him she was
?

---
The only way to accomplish her purpose was.
---
The scheme seemed at first impossible:
 and she much underrated
 the distance.
---
the journey was a fearfully heavy one, even for a strong
 horse, at her own estimate;
---
It was most venturesome for a woman,
 at night, and alone.

---
But could she go on to Liddy's and?
---
she turned back
 towards the village.

---
Her walk was slow,, par-
 ticularly,.
---
for she wished
---
Her plan was now

---
, she thought),
.

---
By this arrangement she could trot Dainty gently all
 the day,
---
she had been to Bath
 at all
---
Such was Bathsheba's scheme.
---
But in her topo-
 graphical ignorance as a late comer to the place, she
 misreckoned the distance of her journey as not much
 more than half what it really was.
---
Her idea, however,
 she proceeded.





---
was there any explanation of her Gilpin's
 rig
---
which had called her mistress to Bath
---
that she hoped
---
said
 Maryann, who with some other women was tying the
 bundles(," but

---
the corn was Bathsheba's
---
Mother says!"

---
she once
 was crying a'most to death.
---
And her eyes were shining and and
---
she was as white as a lily;

---
Miss Everdene and the soldier were walking about
 together
---
" Ay, and she wore a beautiful gold- colour silk
 gown, trimmed with black lace, that would have stood
 alone' ithout legs inside if required.'
---
her hair was brushed splendid
---
And then- i did n't see no more of Miss Everdene at
 all."

---
she'll wish her cake
 dough
---
if so be she's over intimate with that man
---
She's not over intimate with him."
---
She would know better."
---
that the woman was Miss Everdene
---
whose sweetheart she is,
---
since she ca n't be
 yours
---
From it spread the
 tones of two women talking.
---
It was
 Miss Everdene's gig, and
---
Liddy and her mistress were
 the only occupants of the seat.
---
Liddy was asking
 questions about the city of Bath, and
---
her companion
 was answering them listlessly and unconcernedly.
---
Both
 Bathsheba and the horse seemed weary.

---
that she was here
 again, safe and sound
---
inside the room was Bathsheba,
.
---
that she had returned-- only from a
 visit to Liddy,,
---
Liddy's manner
 was odd, but
---
She went in,.
---
in her absence the blind of the
 room containing Bathsheba was pulled down
---
Liddy came out.

---
" she said.

---
she had denied him an entrance
 there now.

---
" Well then-- I know a good deal concerning your
 Fanny Robin's attachment to you.
---
" she might have become"

---
you might have been married to Fanny
---
, I'll settle a sum of money
 upon her, and
---
Bathsheba is
---
only
 playing with you: you are too poor for her
---
Fanny shall have fifty,, and."

---
where she is living
---
she shall have
---
if,,
 Miss Everdene is out of my reach
---
But
 she's only a servant."

---
if you like her best
---
I love Fanny best now.
---
But
 Bathsh-- -- Miss Everdene inflamed me, and.
---
" Bathsheba-- out alone at this time o' night!" said
 Boldwood in amazement, and starting up.
---
Why must
 you meet her?"

---
" She was expecting me to- night-- and,."

---
I must now
 speak to her, and
---
-- and she'll be wandering about
 looking for me
---
You shall hear all I say to her.

---
if she does not know

---
And remember this,, she will think more about me
 than if I tell her flatly I have come to give her up."

---
The tones were
 Bathsheba's.

---
she continued, tenderly."
---
she said, playfully;
"
---
Liddy wanted, and
---
she might stay
 with them till to- morrow--
---
She turned and.

---
Shall I tell her?"
---
And I have two reasons for- choosing
 Fanny.
---
First, I like her best upon the whole, and

---
" You are injuring her you
 love!"

---
Oh, how can she be saved now,?"

---
unless I marry her
---
how the land
 lies with Bathsheba
---
take Bathsheba; I give her up!
---
She must love you
 indeed.
---
as she
 has done
---
" Bathsheba is a woman well to do."
---
continued Bold-
 wood, in nervous anxiety, and, Troy, she will make a
 good wife; and, indeed
---
, she is worth your hastening
 on your marriage with her!"

---
" But she has, and
---
I shall
 be a mere slave to her.
---
I could do anything with poor
 Fanny Robin."

---
No; she would n't have it of me.
---
we'll go straight to her
 parlour, and.
---
But she must know
 nothing of this cash business."

---
" First we'll call upon her."

---
" But she must be consulted; at any rate informed."

---
They went up the hill to Bathsheba's house.
---
Bad, I am not such a villain as to
 make the marriage or misery of any woman a matter
 of huckster and sale.
---
Fanny has long ago left me.

---
where she is
---
you love Bathsheba;
---
yet
 on the merest apparent evidence you instantly believe
 in her dishonour
---
" She has married him!
---
that she had had a fearful journey to Bath,
---
her miscalculating the distance
---
that she had been more than two
 days getting there
---
It was not Bathsheba's way to do
 things furtively.
---
With all her faults, she was candour
 itself.
---
Could she have been entrapped?
---
Her quiet return
 with liddy had to some extent.

---
" Perhaps she's not there."

---
when Bathsheba's
 experiences as a married woman were still new, and

---
said the clear voice
 of Bathsheba, who stood at the inner end of the build-
 ing, observing the scene from behind a table covered
 with cups and viands.
---
the sergeant
 gaily, taking Bathsheba by the hand and
---
For chased my discharge from Her Most Gracious Majesty's
 regiment of cavalry the11th Dragoon Guards, to attend
 to the new duties awaiting me here, I shall continue a
 soldier in spirit and feeling as long as I live."

---
Bathsheba put her hand upon his arm, and,
---
" we'll send the women- folk home
---
Bathsheba indignantly left the barn,.
---
followed by
 all the women and children
---
what this direct message from the Great Mother
 meant
---
Their
 value to Bathsheba, and indeed to anybody, Oak
 mentally estimated by the following simple calcula-
 tion: --
5 x30=150 quarters=500 L.
3 x40=120 quarters=250 L.
 Total..
---
" I will help to my last effort the
 woman I have loved so dearly."

---
Susan to open it
---
People coming
 disturbing women at this time of night ought-- 
---
By this hurried contrivance
 Bathsheba's property in wheat was safe for at any rate
 a week or two,.

---
Could it be that of the only venturesome woman in
 the parish-- Bathsheba?
---
Liddy is afraid to come out.
---
she said, resolutely.
---
She instantly
 took a sheaf upon her shoulder,
---
At her third ascent the rick suddenly brightened
 with the brazen glare of shining majolica--
---
" How terrible!" she exclaimed, and.
---
Bathsheba was on the ground
 now,, and
---
she bore its dazzle
 without flinching-- thunder and ali- and again ascended
 with the load.
---
Bathsheba said nothing; but.

---
She descended the ladder, and, on second thoughts
---
Bathsheba appeared
---
said Bathsheba.
---
"." she said,.
---
I am a timid woman and
---
It was Bathsheba's breath
---
-- she had followed him, and
.

---
She followed, but without a sheaf
" Gabriel.
---
" she said, in a strange and impressive voice.

---
She had not spoken.
---
Bathsheba was

---
sitting almost on the apex of the stack, her feet gathered
 up beneath her, and.

---
She cleared her voice, and."
---
" she whispered
 with desperate impetuosity.

---
" to blame," she quickly added.
"
---
She went down the ladder, and
---
"" said Bathsheba, in a
 flagging cadence."
---
" she said, gratefully.
---
She diminished in the gloom, and, and
---
as she passed through
---
her to speak more warmly to him to- night

---
than she ever had done whilst unmarried and free to
 speak as warmly as she chose
---
that there was
 not, as some fancy, any jilting on-- her part
---
: she never
 promised me
---
till I lost that woman
---
no woman
 ever had power over me for any length of time.
---
One Saturday evening in the month of October
 Bathsheba's vehicle was duly creeping up this incline.

---
She was sitting listlessly in the second seat of the gig,
 whilst walking beside her in farmer's marketing suit
 of unusually fashionable cut
---
Bathsheba, sadly--
 her voice was painfully lowered from the fulness and
 vivacity of the previous summer--"
---
" she implored.
---
Bathsheba
 was at the full depth for tears, but
---
she maintained a
 dry eye.

---
" to say" she exclaimed, with an
 agonized look.

---
Why, Bathsheba, you have lost all the pluck
 and
---
A flash of indignation might have been seen in
 Bathsheba's dark eyes.
---
as she looked resolutely ahead
 after this reply
---
A woman appeared on the brow of the hill.
---
, so that she was very near the
 husband and wife.
---
before she became visible
---
whilst putting
 his foot on the step- the woman passed behind him
---
, Bathsheba could
 see plainly enough to discern the extreme poverty of
 the woman's garb, and the sadness of her face.
"
---
The woman said these words to Troy over his
 shoulder.

---
The woman, on hearing, quickly looked
 up,.
---
Her face was drawn
 into an expression which had gladness and agony both
 among its elements.
---
She uttered an hysterical cry,
 and.

---
I'll see to
 the woman."

---
The horse, gig, and Bathsheba moved on.

---
what my wife
 gives me, and
---
I ca n't ask her now."

---
- i'll see that, Fanny
---
After advancing the distance, Bathsheba turned her head.
---
The
 woman was upon her feet, and
---
Bathsheba saw.
---
her
 withdrawing from Troy, and
---
who that woman was
---
she, with angry hauteur,
 and still regarding him
---
Who is she?"

---
that frankness would
 benefit neither of the women
---
" I know her
 by sight."
"
---
What is her name?"

---
" How should I know her name?"

---
FOR a considerable time the woman walked on.
---
Her
 steps became feebler, and
---
she strained her eyes.
---
At length her onward walk
 dwindled to the merest totter, and
---
she opened a gate
.
---
Underneath this she sat
 down and.

---
When the woman awoke
---
Towards this weak, soft glow the woman
 turned her eyes.

---
"!" she said.
---
The beams from one lamp shone
 for a moment upon the crouching woman, and.
---
she carefully scanned the fence
.
---
as she slowly walked along
---
She drew her fingers across its face.
" Two more!
---
" she said.

---
She leant against the stone as a means of rest for a
  short interval.
---
For a slight distance she bore up bravely,
.
---
Now
 there was not a rustle, not a breeze, not the faintest
 clash of twigs to keep her company.
---
The woman
 looked over the gate,.
---
Her
 attitude was that of a person who listens, either to the
 external world of sound, or to the imagined discourse of
 thought.
---
A close criticism might have detected signs
 proving that she was intent on the latter alternative.

---
, she was

---
By the aid of the Casterbridge aurora, and by feeling
 with her hands, the woman selected two sticks from the
 heaps.
---
These sticks were nearly straight to the height
 of three or four feet, where each branched into a fork
 like the letter Y. She sat down, snapped off the small
 upper twigs, and carried the remainder with her into
 the road.
---
She placed one of these forks under each
 arm as a crutch,,.
---
The girl had made for herself a
 material aid.

---
The pat of her feet,
 and the tap of her sticks upon the highway, were.
---
She had
 passed the last milestone by a good long distance, and
.
---
She was
 exhausted, and
---
At
 last she swayed sideways, and.

---
Here she lay, a shapeless heap, for ten minutes and
 more.
---
The woman desperately
 turned round upon her knees, and next rose to her
 feet.
---
Steadying herself by the help of one crutch, she
 essayed a step, then another, then a third,.
---
Thus she pro-

---
She staggered across to the first post,
 clung to it, and looked around.

---
She listened.
---
" Less than a mile!" the woman murmured.
---
she added, after a pause.
---
After an interval she again spoke.
---
Holding to the rails, she advanced,.

---
whilst she dragged her feet on beneath
---
This woman was not given to soliloquy; but.
---
She said again in the
 same tone,"."

---
She passed five posts and.

---
she passed five more.

---
She passed five more.

---
She passed them.

---
" she
 said,.

---
She crawled to the bridge.
---
During the effort each
 breath of the woman went into the air.
" Now for the truth of the matter."
---
she said,.
---
what she had known all the time

---
that she would have been powerless to face in
 the lump
---
that the woman, by
 some mysterious intuition, had grasped the paradoxical
 truth that blindness may operate more vigorously than
 prescience, and the short- sighted effect more than the
 far- seeing
---
The half- mile stood now before the sick and weary
 woman like a stolid Juggernaut.
---
It was an impassive
 King of her world.
---
She surveyed
 the wide space,
---
Every conceivable aid,
 method, stratagem, mechanism, a
 human being unperceived, was revolved in her busy
 brain, and.
---
She thought of
 sticks, wheels,
---
crawling-- she even thought of rolling.

---
" she whispered, and
---
It glided noiselessly towards the recumbent woman.

---
She became conscious of something
---
touching her
 hand; it was softness and
---
She
 opened
---
her eye's, and the substance touched her face.

---
A dog was licking her cheek.

---
woman threw her idea into figure
---
In her reclining position she looked up to him.
---
just
 as in earlier times she had
---
as she,
 respectfully withdrew a step or two
---
when the woman
 moved, and,
---
that she did not repulse him
---
The animal, seeing, he
 licked her hand again.

---
A thought moved within her like lightning."
---
She pointed in the direction of Casterbridge, and

---
she could not follow
---
The ultimate and saddest singularity of woman's effort
 and invention was reached when, with a quickened breath-

---
ing, she rose to a stooping posture, and,, leant firmly
 thereon, and.
---
Whilst she
 sorrowed in her heart
---
she cheered with her voice, and

---
Her friend moved forward slowly, and.
---
half her
 weight being thrown upon the animal
---
Sometimes
 she sank.
---
as she had sunk from walking erect, from
 the crutches, from the rails
---
who now
 thoroughly understood her desire and her incapacity,

---
She always called
 him back, and
---
that the
 woman listened for human sounds
---
that she had an object in keeping her
 presence on the road and her forlorn state unknown
---
The she ll had been so thin, so
 devoid of excrescence, and,.

---
The woman raised herself
 as high as possible upon her knees, and.
---
She moved it and.

---
How did she get here?"
---
said one of the women.

CHAPTER XLI



 SUSPICION-- FANNY IS.
---
SENT FOR


 BATHSHEBA said very little to her husband all that
 evening of their return from market, and
---
,
 Bathsheba going to church both morning and afternoon.

---
Her countenance instantly sank.
---
she said.

---
" O, Frank!" Bathsheba replied, and"
---
The tenderest and softest phases of Bathsheba's
 nature were prominent now--.
---
when she was
---
which the wariness of her character cool
 too frequently threw over them
---
Had the woman not been
 his wife
---
?" she asked.
---
" she said, with features between a smile and a
 pout.

---
She reddened.
---
" she said, quickly
"?"

---
She gave a sigh of resignation.
---
Bathsheba's eyes had been accidentally lifted at that
 moment, and
---
she saw the action and.
---
She
 flushed in pain and surprise, and
---
some words escaped
 her."
---
before she had thought
---
A woman's curl of hair!" she said.

---
It
 is the hair of a young woman."

---
she married yet
---
" Is she alive?"

---
" Is she pretty?"

---
how she can be, poor thing, under
 such an awful affliction
---
" Why, her hair has been admired by everybody
 who has seen her.
---
since she has worn it loose,
---
she ex-
 claimed, in incipient accents of pique.
---
her
 heart was big in her throat, and
---
the ducts to her eyes
 were painfully full.
---
as she was
---
last she burst out
---
women will be the death of me
---
if you do n't love me better than any
 woman in the world
---
You like the woman
 who owns that pretty hair-- yes
---
You must like her
 best,!"

---
she said,
---
although I am a woman, and
---
" she said,.
---
the independent and
 spirited Bathsheba is come to this!"

---
, Bathsheba burst into great
 sobs-- dry- eyed sobs, which cut as they came, without
 any softening by tears.
---
But she determined.
---
She was conquered; but
---
she
 would never own it as long as she lived.
---
Her pride
 was indeed brought low by despairing discoveries of her
 spoliation by marriage with a less pure nature than her
 own.
---
She chafed to and fro in rebelliousness, like a
 caged leopard
---
; her whole soul was in arms, and
---
the
 blood fired her face.
---
Until she had met Troy,
---
Bath-
 sheba had been proud of her position as a woman
---
that her lips had been

---
that her waist had
 never been encircled by a lover's arm
---
She hated
 herself now.
---
she had
---
She had never taken kindly to
 the idea of marriage in the abstract.
---
as did the majority
 of women she saw about her
---
In the turmoil of her
 anxiety for her lover she had agreed; but

---
that had accompanied her happiest hours
 on this account
---
Although she scarcely knew
 the divinity's name
---
, Diana was the goddess whom
 Bathsheba instinctively adored.
---
That she had never,
 by look, word, or sign, encouraged a man
---
to approach
 her-- that she had felt herself sufficient to herself, and
.
---
if she had never
 stooped to folly of this kind, respectable as it was, and

---
as she had stood on the hill at
 Norcombe
---
The next morning she rose earlier than usual, and
.
---
the horse saddled for her ride round the farm in
 the customary way
---
When she came in at half- past
 eight-- their usual hour for breakfasting
---
-- she was.

---
After breakfast she was cool and collected-- quite
 herself in fact-- and
---
she rambled to the gate,.

---
which she still
 personally superintended
---
for whom
 she began
---
Of course, she sometimes thought of him in the light of
 an old lover, and
---
though she could feel
---
But
 Bathsheba,, was not much given
 to futile dreaming, and
---
She saw.

---
Bathsheba blushed painfully,
 and.
---
Bathsheba, experienced great relief.
---
" Well, what's the message, Joseph?" she
 said.

---
that a conversation with a lady re-
 quired, spoke to Bathsheba over the gate
---
You'll never see Fanny Robin no more
---
Because she's dead in the Union."

---
" What did she die from?"

---
She was such a limber maid that' a could stand no
 hardship, even when I knowed her, and' a went like a
 candle- snoff, so
---
She was took bad in the
 morning, and,
---
being quite feeble and worn out, she
 died in the evening.
---
She belongs by law to our parish;
 and
---
Fanny was my uncle's servant,
 and,
---
although I only knew her for a couple of days,

---
FANNY IS SENT
---
FOR
 she belongs to me.
---
Fanny being in a workhouse
---
Bathsheba
 had begun, and
---
she spoke
 with real feeling....
---
not to put her in a waggon; we'll get a hearse."

---
" she said, musingly.
---
because she knew him so well."I will, ma'am
---
Fanny come
 to this
---
" Dear me-- Casterbridge Union-- and is?" said Bathsheba, musing.
---
she was far away
---
How long
 has she lived there?"

---
" Oh!-- then she has not been staying there as a
 regular inmate?"

---
She first went t'other
 side o' Wessex, and.
---
since then she's been picking up for several months,
 at the house of a very respectable widow- woman who
 takes in work of that sort
---
She only got handy the
 Union- house on Sunday morning' a b'lieve, and.
---
that she had traipsed every step
 of the way from Melchester
---
Why she left her place
---
whilst this word came from her in a long- drawn
 breath
---
Did she walk along our turnpike- road?
---
" she
 said, in a suddenly restless and eager voice.

---
she did
---
Ma'am, shall I call Liddy?

---
" No; do n't call her; it is nothing.
---
When did she
 pass Weatherbury?"

---
What was the
 colour of Fanny Robin's hair?"

---
She turned herself away from him, and.
---
About an hour after, she
 heard the noise of the waggon and.
---
as she had directed

---
Bathsheba hardly saw them now.

---
" I'm sure that all I know is that she arrived in the
 morning and died in the evening without further parley.

---
` Little Fanny Robin is dead, Joseph,'

---
-- and how did she
 come
---
Well, she's dead in Casterhridge
 Union
---
how she came
---
She reached the Union
 early Sunday morning, and
---
what she'd been doing
 lately
---
that she walked
 therefrom at the end of last week,
---
Her death might have been brought on by
 biding in the night wind,, ma'am
---
she'd go off in a decline
---
; for people
 used to say: she used.
---
She
 looked at him so intently that Joseph's eyes quailed.
"
---
she was looking upon the ground.

---
In
 the course of the afternoon she said to Liddy, Who had
 been informed of the occurrence," What was the colour
 of poor Fanny Robin's hair?
---
- i only saw her for a day or two."

---
she wore it rather short,
 and,
---
her let it down, and
---
when
 she was going to bed
---
so that some-
 times people mistook them-- --"
" Liddy, for Heaven's sake
---
said
 Bathsheba, with the nervous petulance that comes from
 worrying perceptions.





---
Their connection with her, short, was
 over for ever.

---
the dead
 silence was broken only by a heavy particle falling from
 a tree through the evergreens and alighting with a smart
 rap upon the coffin of poor Fanny.
---
for the girl in waiting, say," Maid
---
I've got poor little Fanny
 Robin in my waggon outside, and
---
I must be at the
 churchyard gates at a quarter to five with her."

---
And so she's nailed up in
 parish boards after all, and."

---
you ca n't bring
 her to life
---
The pore woman's dead, and, and you may as well sit down comfortable,
 and."

---
The poor woman
 is dead,"

---
is n't she, and?
---
there's the woman a- biding outside in the
 waggon."

---
followed by the maid of the inn bearing a candle
---
Nobody can hurt a dead woman." at length
---
All her is done
---
"-- she's beyond us:  and
?
---
what you do with her at all
---
If she'd been
 alive
---
, I would have been the first to help her.
---
If she
 now wanted victuals and drink
---
But she's dead, and
---
no speed of ours will
 bring her to life.
---
The woman's past us-- time spent
 upon her is
---
for to- morrow we may be like her
---
that was left of the unfortunate Fanny Robin who
 had followed the Eleventh from Casterbridge through
 Melchester and onwards
---
she had followed

---
that the whole truth of the matter might not be published
 till at any rate the girl had been in her grave for a few
 days,
---
if she could
 tell me the reason of the delay
---
that Fanny
 had been an inmate of the farm- house for several years
 in the lifetime of Bathsheba's uncle
---
as she looked up to him
---
her eyes were suspicious
 and
---
At first Bathsheba assented with
 a mien of indifference to his proposition that they should
 go on to the church at once with their burden; but

---
immediately afterwards, following Gabriel to the gate,
 she swerved to the extreme of solicitousness on Fanny's
 account, and.
---
that the girl might be brought into
 the house
---
just as she lay now, with her flowers
 and green leaves about her,
---
she said,"."

---
though she may have erred
 grievously in leaving her home
---
that, she is still our sister:
 and
---
that she is a
 member of the flock of Christ
---
Gabriel she d an
 honest tear.
---
Bathsheba seemed unmoved.
---
as Bathsheba directed
---
CHAPTER XLIII



 FANNY'S REVENGE


" DO you want me any longer ma'am?"
---
I am not
 at all afraid of Fanny,.
---
She was such a childlike, nesh young
 thing
---
that her spirit could n't appear to anybody if it
 tried
---
?" said Bathsheba, desultorily.
---
She
 suddenly exclaimed in an impulsive and excited whisper,
?"

---
anything strange said of Fanny
---
she
 burst into tears.

---
Liddy, looking at the
 weeping woman with astonishment
---
She came
 to Bathsheba's side with a face full of sympathy.

---
Liddy then left the parlour and.

---
Bathsheba was lonely and miserable now
---
; not lone-
 lier actually than she had been before her marriage;
 but
---
her loneliness then was to that of the present time
.
---
Her
 wayward sentiment that evening concerning Fanny's
 temporary resting- place had been the result of a strange
 complication of impulses in Bathsheba's bosom.
---
which would
 have withheld all sympathy from the dead woman
---
more accurately described as a
 determined rebellion against her prejudices, a revulsion
 from a lower instinct of uncharitableness,, be-
 cause in life.

---
she had preceded Bathsheba in the atten-
 tions of a man whom Bathsheba had by no means

---
though her love was sick to death
 just now with the gravity of a further misgiving
---
Liddy reappeared, and
---
she said,!Maryann
---
It
 is about Fanny.
---
" to Weatherbury
 within this last hour-- that-- --" Liddy came close to
 her mistress and.

---
as she spoke in
 the direction of the room where Fanny lay
---
Bathsheba trembled from head to foot.

---
" she said,
---
"
 Bathsheba turned and.
---
that
 Liddy might not see her face
---
that her mistress
 was going
---
Finding to say no more, Liddy glided out,.

---
as she continued
---
Bathsheba's face, looking into the
 fire that evening, might have excited solicitousness on
 her account even among those who loved her least.

---
The sadness of Fanny Robin's fate did not make Bath-
 sheba's glorious,, and
---
although she was the Esther to this
 poor Vashti
---
When
 Liddy came into the room a second time
---
When she went out after telling the story
---
Her simple
 country nature, fed on old- fashioned principles, was

---
troubled by that which would have troubled a woman
 of the world very little, both Fanny and her child, if she
 had one, being dead.

---
Bathsheba had grounds for conjecturing a connection
 between her own history and the dimly suspected
 tragedy of Fanny's end which Oak and Boldwood never
 for a moment credited her with possessing.
---
The
 meeting with the lonely woman on the previous Saturday
 night had been unwitnessed and unspoken of.
---
that Bathsheba's
 perceptions had already been exercised in the matter
---
she was now undergoing,
---
She suddenly felt a longing desire to speak to some
 one stronger than herself, and.
---
her lurking
 doubts with stoicism
---
Where could she find such a
 friend?
---
She was by far the
 coolest of the women under her roof.
---
what she
 wanted
---
Might she but go to Gabriel Oak!
---
What a way, she thought, of enduring
 things.
---
how
 she would wish
---
as
 she was at this moment
---
-- she felt convinced of that
---
If she were?
---
She flung a cloak round her,.
---
Bathsheba closed
 the door, and.
---
till she came
 opposite to Gabriel's cottage, where he now lived alone,

---
she could see him
 plainly,
---
,
 she knew, and.

---
if she tapped
---
for her resolve
---
She felt.
---
she could not do it,

---
Not for worlds now could she give a hint about her
 misery to him,
---
She must suspect, and
 guess, and chafe, and bear it all alone.

---
she lingered by the bank
---
fascinated by the atmosphere of content
 which seemed to spread from that little dwelling, and
 was so sadly lacking in her own
---
The contrast of the
 picture with her rebellious and agitated existence at this
 same time was too much for her to bear to look upon
 longer.
---
for her to make a truce with
 trouble by any such means
---
She must tread her giddy
 distracting measure to its last note,.

---
as she had begun it
---
With a swollen heart she went again up the lane, and
.

---
More fevered now by a reaction from the first feelings
, she paused in
 the hall,.
---
wherein Fanny
 lay
---
She locked her fingers,.
---
she added, slowly,"
---
And
 I will"
 Bathsheba in after times could never gauge the mood
 which carried her through the actions following this
 murmured resolution on this memorable evening of her
 life.
---
She went to the lumber- closet for a screw- driver.

---
At the end of a short though undefined time she found
 herself in the small room,
---
a mist
 before her eyes, and an excruciating pulsation in her
 brain, standing beside the uncovered coffin of the girl

---
as she gazed within
---
She was conscious of having brought about this
 situation by a series of actions done as by one in an
 extravagant dream
---
which had burst upon her in the hall with glaring
 obviousness
---
within which the young girl lay, and

---
if she had antici-

---
which came with knowing beyond doubt the
 last chapter of Fanny's story
---
Bathsheba's head sank upon her bosom, and
---
" she said, and
---
the silent room added
 length to her moan.

---
Her tears fell fast beside the unconscious pair in the
 coffin: tears of a complicated origin, of a nature inde-
 scribable, almost indefinable except as other than those
 of simple sorrow.
---
Assuredly their wonted fires must
 have lived in Fanny's ashes when events were so shaped
 as to chariot her hither in this natural, unobtrusive, yet
 effectual manner.
---
The one feat alone--, Fanny had achieved.
---
et had thrown over herself a
 garish light of mockery, and
---
Fanny's face was framed in by that yellow hair of
 hers; and
---
she was retaliating for her pain with all the merciless
 rigour of the Mosaic law
---
Bathsheba indulged in contemplations of escape from
 her position by immediate death,
---
which had glorified it in her rival's case
---
She glided
 rapidly up and down the room,
---
, her hands hanging clasped in front of her,
, yet
---
as she thought and
---
O, I hate her
---
that I hate her, for
 it
---
yes, my flesh insists upon hating her,!
---
If she had only lived
---
, I could
 ave been angry and cruel towards her with some justifi-
 cation; but
---
to be vindictive towards a poor dead woman
 recoils upon myself.
---
Bathsheba became at this moment so terrified at her
 own state of mind that she looked around for some sort
 of refuge from herself.
---
The vision of recurred to her, and
---
which animates women she seized upon the idea
---
so would she.

---
She knelt beside the coffin, and
---
when Bathsheba arose
---
a regret for the antagonistic instincts seized upon her just before.

---
In her desire to make atonement she took flowers
 from a vase by the window, and.
---
Bathsheba knew no other
 way of showing kindness to persons departed than by
 giving them flowers.
---
She knew not how long.
---
she
 remained engaged thus
---
She forgot time, life, where
 she was.
---
, what she was doing
---
A slamming together of
 the coach- house doors in the yard brought her to her-
 self again.
---
Bathsheba, pallid as a corpse on
 end, gazed back at him in the same wild way.

---
said Bathsheba, to herself
 more than to him.
---
She came with a dilated eye towards
 the door,.

---
she
 continued.

---
she went off into
 a state of passivity.
---
the light slanted down, distinctly enkindling the
 cold features of both mother and babe
---
Do you know her?"
---
said Bathsheba, in a small
 enclosed echo, as from the interior of a cell.

---
" Is it she?"

---
Bathsheba was regarding him from the other
 side, still with parted lips and distracted eyes.
---
Capacity
 for intense feeling is proportionate to the general
 intensity of the nature, and perhaps in all Fanny's
 sufferings, much greater relatively to her strength
---
, there
 never was a time she suffered in an absolute sense
 what Bathsheba suffered now.

---
At the sight and sound of that, to her, unendurable
 act, Bathsheba sprang towards him.
---
which had been scattered over her existence

---
since she knew,
---
when she had

---
The revulsion from
 her indignant mood a little earlier, meditated upon compromised honour, forestalment,
 eclipse in maternity by another
---
She had sighed for
 her self- completeness then, and
---
now she cried aloud
 against the severance of the union she had deplored.

---
She flung her arms round Troy's neck,!
---
than she did: kiss me
 too, Frank
---
There was something so abnormal and startling in
 the childlike pain and simplicity of this appeal from a
 woman of Bathsheba's calibre and independence,.
---
Fanny's own
 spirit seemed.
---
her rival being now
---
All the feeling
 she had been betrayed into showing
---
she drew back to
 herself again by a strenuous effort of self- command.

---
What have?" she asked
 her bitter voice
---
This woman is more
 to me, dead. 
---
as she is, than ever you were, or
---
If she's 
---
" she added,.

---
as a
 continuation of the same cry, and sobbing pitifully:
 and the rarity with her of such abandonment only made
 the condition more dire
---
She waited not an instant, but.





---
that she definitely noticed
---
The first time her position
 was.
---
when she reached a gate leading into a thicket
---
On looking
 into the place, it occurred to her and.
---
that she had seen it
 by daylight on some previous occasion,
---
She could think of
 nothing better to do with her palpitating self than to go
 in here and hide; and.
---
entering, she lighted on a spot
 sheltered from the damp fog by a reclining trunk, where
 she sank down upon a tangled couch of fronds and
 stems
---
She mechanically pulled some armfuls round
 her, and.

---
Whether she slept or not that night
---
Bathsheba was
 not clearly aware.
---
that, a long time afterwards, she
 became conscious of some interesting proceedings which
 were going on in the trees above her head and around
---
Third: " Tink- tink- tink- tink- a- chink!" from the hedge,
 It was a robin.

---
she believed from his voice.
---
looking through
 the ferns Bathsheba could just discern in the wan light
 of daybreak a team of her own horses.
---
She
 watched them.
---
She looked further around.
---
Day was just dawning,
 and beside its cool air and colours her heated actions
 and resolves of the night.

---
She perceived.
---
Bathsheba shook her dress to
 get rid of them, when multitudes of the same family lying
 round about her rose and fluttered away in the breeze
 thus created, like ghosts from an enchanter fleeing."

---
the
 glow from the as yet unrisen sun attracted her eyes
 thither.
---
From her feet, and between the beautiful
 yellowing ferns with their feathery arms, the ground
 sloped downwards to a hollow, in which was a species
 of swamp, dotted with fungi.
---
some exhibiting
 to her listless gaze their clammy tops, others their
 oozing gills.
---
Bathsheba arose with a tremor at the
 thought of having passed the night on the brink of
 so dismal a place.

---
Bathsheba's nerves were still unstrung:

---
she crouched down out of sight again, and
---
Bathsheba was
,.

---
for it was a woman
 -- approached with her face askance,
---
When she got a little
 further round to the left, and
---
drew nearer, Bathsheba
 could see the newcomer's profile against the sunny
 sky', and.

---
Bathsheba's heart bounded with gratitude in
---
that she was
---
she
 jumped up
---
" she said, or;
 but
---
the words had only been framed by her lips
---
She had lost her voice by exposure
 to the clogged atmosphere all these hours of night.

---
said
 the girl, as soon as she saw Bathsheba.

---
Bathsheba said in a whisper,
.
---
which she vainly endeavoured
---
Liddy, not knowing this, stepped
 down upon the swamp,
---
as she did so
---
Bathsheba never forgot that transient little picture
 of Liddy crossing the swamp to her there in the
 morning light.
---
Iridescent bubbles of dank subter-
 ranean breath rose from the sweating sod beside the
 waiting maid's feet.

---
as she trod,
---
Liddy did not sink,.

---
as Bathsheba had anticipated
---
She landed safely on the other side, and.

---
" Poor thing!" said Liddy, with tears in her eyes,
.
---
said Bathsheba, hurriedly.
---
Liddy, do n't question me, mind.
---
She will soon be-- at nine o'clock."

---
Liddy, without exactly understanding everything, or
 anything, in this episode, assented, and
---
Liddy vanished, and
---
Fanny gone?
---
at the end of twenty minutes
 returned with a cloak, hat" said Bathsheba.

---
" No." said her companion,.

---
Bathsheba wrapped herself up and.
---
Her voice was then a little clearer, and

---
trifling colour returned to her face.
---
" she said.

---
Bathsheba replying in monosyllables to Liddy's
 prattle, for her mind
---
She interrupted with--
" l wonder if Fanny is gone by this time?"

---
She came back with the information that the
 men were just taking away the corpse.

---
; that Bathsheba
 had been inquired for
---
; that she had replied to the
 effect
---
that her mistress was unwell and
---
Liddy then ventured-- you did n't mean it, ma'am?"

---
It is only women with
 no pride in them who run away from their husbands.

---
A runaway wife
 is an encumbrance to everybody, a burden to herself and
 a byword--
---
Liddy,--
 God forbid!
---
Bathsheba
 glided up the back stairs to a disused attic, and
---
her
 companion followed.
" Liddy.
---
" she said, with a lighter heart, for youth and

---
said
 Liddy.

---
A
 faint gleam of humour passed over her face."

---
as she said:

---
"
 All that day Bathsheba and Liddy lived in the attic
 in a state of barricade; a precaution which proved to be
 needless as against Troy, for he did not appear in the
 neighbourhood or trouble them at all.
---
Bathsheba sat
 at the window till sunset,.

---
She could see the brown
 and black heads of the young lads darting about right
 and
---
Bathsheba inquired, the next time.

---
that
 Liddy entered the room
---
twas began putting up grand carved
 tombstone" said Liddy. 
---
" Bathsheba asked.

---
" said Liddy.





---
Twenty pounds having been secured from Bathsheba
---
no
 Fanny appeared.
---
at that moment she was being
.
---
robed in her grave- clothes by two attendants at the
 Union poorhouse-- the first and last tiring- women the
 gentle creature had ever been honoured with
---
backed up by Bathsheba's reproaches
---
that Fanny
 had been really prevented by illness from keeping her
 promise
---
This time she could have made no mistake

---
the grave dug the day before for Fanny
---
The
 crocuses and hyacinths were; some of
 the summer flowers he placed over her head and feet,
 the lilies and forget- me- nots over her heart.
---
so
 carefully planted by Fanny's repentant lover
---
The planting
 of flowers on Fanny's grave had been perhaps but a
 species of elusion of the primary grief, and
---
Meanwhile, Bathsheba remained a voluntary prisoner
 in the attic.
---
The door was kept, except during
 the entries and exits of Liddy,.
---
she called Bathsheba's attention to it.

---
until Liddy was sent to bed
---
bathsheba did not sleep very heavily that night.

---
When her attendant was unconscious and softly
---
Bathsheba sat
 here, and
---
when
 she withdrew
---
she arose again, and.
---
from
 the direction of the church she could hear another noise
 -- peculiar, and not intermittent like the rest.

---
Liddy knocked at eight o'clock, and
---
Bathsheba un-
 locked the door.

---
" What a heavy rain, ma'am!"
 said Liddy,.

---
when her inquiries about breakfast had been
 made
---
Not being able to read, think, or work, Bathsheba asked
 Liddy.
---
The tongue of the
 more childish woman still ran upon recent events."
---
" she asked.

---
"" said Bathsheba.

---
where they
 have put Fanny
---
Bathsheba had all sorts of dreads about meeting her
 husband."
---
" she said
" No, ma'am
---
She hated and; but
---
Bathsheba had

---
"?" she said.

---
Bathsheba was momentarily relieved of that wayward
 heaviness of the past twenty- four hours
---
quenched the vitality of youth in her without sub-
 stituting the philosophy of maturer years, and.
---
So, she put on her bonnet, and.
---
, she was not likely to meet many of them in
 the road.
---
that Fanny had been laid in the
 reprobates' quarter of the graveyard,
---
which, from nameless feelings, she at the
 same time dreaded
---
She had been unable to
 overcome an impression that some connection existed
 between her rival and the light through the trees.

---
Bathsheba skirted the buttress, and.
---
, she had not as yet attracted his
 attention.
---
Fanny's, and
 she looked on both sides and around for some humbler
 mound,.
---
she read the words with
 which the inscription opened: --
" Erected by Francis Troy in Beloved Memory of
 Fanny Robin."

---
how she received this knowledge of the
 authorship of the work, which to himself had caused
 considerable astonishment
---
she bade him good morning, and.
---
as she desired
---
, Bathsheba collected the
 flowers, and.
---
which is so conspicuous
 in a woman's gardening, and
---
She requested Oak.

---
Finally, with the superfluous magnanimity of a woman
 whose narrower instincts have brought down bitterness
 upon her
---
instead of love, she wiped the mud spots from
 the tomb
---
as if she rather liked its words than otherwise,




 CHAPTER XLVII



 ADVENTURES BY THE SHORE



---
DOUBTS LINGER


 BATHSHEBA underwent the enlargement of her
 Husband's absence from hours to days with a slight
 feeling of surprise, and a slight feeling of relief;
---
She belonged to
 him: 
---
that she could not speculate on contingencies
---
Taking
 no further interest in herself as a splendid woman, she
 acquired the indifferent feelings of an outsider in contem-
 plating her probable fate as a singular wretch
---
Her original vigorous
 pride of youth had sickened, and
---
Bath-
 sheba had made up her mind.
---
that alternatives on any
 noteworthy scale had ceased for her
---
Soon, or later--
 and that not very late-- her husband would be home
 again.
---
ally been shown by the agent to the estate some distrust
 of Bathsheba's tenure as James Everdene's successor,
 on the score of her sex, and her youth, and her beauty;

---
She had latterly been in great doubt as
 to what the legal effects of her marriage would be upon
 her position; but
---
no notice had been taken as yet of
 her change of name, and
---
Hence Bathsheba lived in a perception that her
 purposes were broken of.
---
She was not a woman who
 could hope on without good materials for the process,

---
that her mistake had been a fatal one
---
perceiving
 clearly, she
 accepted her position
---
The first Saturday after Troy's departure she went
 a journey she had not before
 taken since her marriage.
---
On this Saturday Bathsheba
 was passing slowly on foot through the crowd of rural
 business- men.
---
who were as usual with feelings that those healthy lives were dearly paid
 for by exclusion from possible aldermanship, when a
 man, who had apparently been following her, said some
 words to another on her left hand
---
Bathsheba's ears
 were keen as those of any wild animal, and
---
she dis-

---
though her back
 was towards him

---
Is that she there?"

---
" I have some awkward news to break to her.
---
As if endowed with the spirit of prophecy, Bathsheba
 gasped out,
---
Then she said and.
---
which had latterly gathered over her
---
A darkness came into her eyes, and
---
she
 fell.

---
who had
 been observing her from under the portico of the old
 corn- exchange
---
when she passed through the group
 without
---
as she sank
 down
---
, Bathsheba had
 opened her eyes.
---
Remembering all,
 she murmured,"!"

---
she had been in his
 arms
---
What did it matter about her not knowing it?
---
She
 had been close to his breast
---
her horse to be put into the
 gig
---
though still pale and unwell, she had in
 the meantime
---
as she
 had driven to town, Boldwood,
---
which was more com-
 fortable than her own conveyance
---
These proposals
 Bathsheba gently declined, and
---
About half- an- hour later she invigorated herself by
 an effort, and.

---
She went out of the town by a tortuous back street, and
.
---
,
 she proceeded at once upstairs.
---
Liddy met her on the
 landing.
---
The news had preceded Bathsheba to and
---
Liddy looked inquiringly into
 her mistress's face.
---
Bathsheba had nothing to say.

---
She entered her bedroom and.
---
till night enveloped her
---
the
 extreme lines only of her shape were visible
---
"?" she said.

---
" said Liddy, with hesitation.

---
" No, no, no." said Bathsheba, hurriedly.

---
?" said Liddy, amazed.

---
Bathsheba remained firm in this opinion till Monday,
.
---
for her to examine and
---
It
 was so evident to her in the midst of her agitation that
 Troy had undressed in the full conviction of dressing
 again almost immediately,.

---
Then Bathsheba said to herself
---
; strange that she should not
 be.
---
A strange reflection occurred to her,.
---
how the apparent might
 differ from the real- made vivid by her bygone jealousy
 of Fanny, and
---
the remorse-- did not blind her to the perception of a likelier
 difference, less tragic, but to herself far more disastrous.

---
, Bathsheba took Troy's watch into
 her hand,.
---
She opened the case
.
---
she was his
---
" she said.
---
why should I keep her hair?
---
She took it in her
 hand, and.
---
-i'll keep it in memory of her, poor thing
---
"" she added,
.





---
Bathsheba, having
 previously been living in a state of suspended feeling
, now lived in a mood of
 quietude.
---
While
 she had known him
---
to be alive she could have thought
 of his death with equanimity; but
---
she had lost him
---
now, she regretted.
---
She kept the farm,
---
because she had done so in bygone
 days,
---
She looked back upon that
 past over a great gulf,.

---
as if she were now a dead person,

---
having the faculty of meditation still left in her, by
 means of which
---
, like the mouldering gentlefolk of the
 poet's story, she could sit and
---
sug-
 gested by Bathsheba's recent act of promotion or not
---
when she learnt of this proposal- for
 Oak
---
She considered.

---
,
 whose unreasoning devotion to Bathsheba could only
 be characterized as a fond madness which neither
 time nor circumstance, evil nor good report,.
---
Bathsheba
 having at last been persuaded.
---
as she entered the church in that guise

---
she had been

---
than she had formerly been of the feelings of
 others
---
that, should she be willing at
 any time in the future
---
To the eyes of the middle- aged, Bathsheba was
 perhaps additionally charming just now.
---
Her exuber-
 ance of spirit was pruned down
---
; the original phantom
 of delight had shown herself, and
---
she had been able to
 enter this second poetical phase without losing much
 of the first in the process.

---
Bathsheba's return from a two months' visit to her
 old aunt at Norcombe afforded the impassioned and
 yearning farmer a pretext for inquiring directly after
 her-- now possibly in the ninth month of her
 widowhood-- and
---
She simpered, and
---
her long
 the coldest- hearted neighbour could scarcely say
---
less
" She is quite well, sir
---
she was cheerful
---
" She do, sir.
---
I've been with her all through her
 troubles, and.
---
if she were
---
I should bide with her
---
She promises."
---
which Liddy's words appeared
---
" No-- she does n't promise it exactly.
---
When she alludes to the
 possibility of marrying again
---
She never do allude to it, sir.
---
" said Liddy,.

---
Well,
 perhaps, as she is absolute mistress again now
---
, it is wise
 of her."

---
that she supposed
---
she might marry again at
 the end of seven years from last year,
---
if she cared to
 risk Mr. Troy's coming back and claiming her
---
that she
 might
---
She might marry at once in every reasonable
 person's opinion,."

---
" to ask them" said Liddy, innocently.

---
In little
 more than six years from this time Bathsheba might
 certainly marry him.
---
There was something definite in
 that hope, for admitting that there might have been no
 deep thought in her words to Liddy about marriage
---
,
 they showed at least her creed on the matter.

---
: what were six for such a woman as this?
---
sible she had never yet known its full volume, and
---
her see
---
But the large united
 flocks of Bathsheba and Farmer Boldwood formed a
 valuable and imposing multitude which demanded much
 attention, and
---
The great mass of sheep in the fair consisted of
 South Downs and the old Wessex horned breeds, to
 the latter class Bathsheba's and Farmer Boldwood's
 mainly belonged.
---
at the mercy of
 she swayed like a reed shaken by the wind
---
" Did ye ever hear such onreasonable
 woman as that?
---
Upon my carcase, neighbours,, the damn women
 might eat the show for me!"

---
that
 the woman in spangles, brazen rings set with glass
 diamonds,
---
Whether Bathsheba
 thought him dead
---
Bathsheba was not a women; and
---
, if she had not already
 done so
---
what a life such a future of poverty
 with her would be, the spectre of Fanny constantly be-
 tween them,
---
Bathsheba---- had, like every one else,
 read or heard the announcement that Mr. Francis, the
 Great Cosmopolitan Equestrian and Roughrider, would
 enact the part of Turpin, and she was not yet too old
 and careworn to be without a little curiosity to see him.

---
who had been watching
 all the day for an opportunity of speaking to her, seeing

---
said Bathsheba, colour springing
 up in the centre of her cheeks.
---
that she hesitated
---
Now Bathsheba did care a little.
---
because she
 feared
---
She had been hoping
---
that she said," Then if
 you will just look in first, to see if there's room, I think
 I will go in for a minute or two."

---
And so a short time after this Bathsheba appeared
 in the tent with Boldwood at her elbow,.

---
who, taking
 her to a" reserved" seat, again withdrew
---
Bathsheba
 immediately found, to her confusion,.

---
that she was the
 single reserved individual in the tent, the rest of the
 crowded spectators, one and all, standing on their legs
 on the borders of the arena, where they got twice as
 good a view of the performance for half the money
---
as many eyes were turned upon her
---
Once there, Bathsheba was

---
forced to make the best of it and remain: she sat
 down,.
---
In a few
 minutes she noticed the fat red nape of Coggan's neck
 among those standing just below her, and Joseph Poor-
 grass's saintly profile a little further on.

---
that she would be sure to recognize
 his voice
---
She looked so charming and fair that his cool mood
 about Weatherbury people was changed.
---
her to exercise this power over him in the
 twinkling of an eye
---
that his
 attractive young wife,, should
 despise him more by discovering him in
---
as she lay
 upon the board upon his shoulder
---
that
 day if she never had done so before
---
; she
 was conversing with a man.
---
: surely she was not so unprincipled as to flirt in
 a fair!
---
if, then, she reckoned upon his
 death as an absolute certainty
---
She was

---
that she held in her
 hand
---
leant so idly
 against the canvas that it was pressed to the shape of
 her shoulder
---
she was, in fact, as good as in Troy's
 arms; and.

---
that she might not feel its warmth through the
 cloth
---
She was handsome as ever, and
---
she was his.
---
how
 the proud girl to love him, would hate him on dis-
 covering
---
," said Bathsheba.
---
She took
 out her purse and.
---
she said, coldly.
---
That
 Bathsheba could not endure
---
Bathsheba would not read it
---
; she would not even put
 out her hand.
---
" Oh, well." said Bathsheba, carelessly," but
---
Bathsheba held the note in her right hand.
---
when, in order to take a slice, she put the note
 into her left hand, and.
---
where she was still holding the purse,

---
her hand to drop beside her close to
 the canvas
---
encircled by a bracelet of coral chippings which
 she wore
---
which burst from
 her
---
that the rogue had imagined a slip of
 paper which she held in her hand to he a bank note,
 for he had seized it, and
---
CHAPTER LI



 BATHSHEBA TALKS WITH HER OUTRIDER



---
But having fallen in with Farmer Boldwood
 accidentally( on her part at least) at the refreshment-
 tent, she found it impossible to refuse his offer to ride
 on horseback beside her as escort.
---
before she was aware
---
Immediately after the incident in the tent, she had

---
risen to go-- now absolutely alarmed and really grateful
 for her old lover's protection-- though regretting Gabriel's
 absence, whose company she would have
---
; she would not, on any
 consideration, treat Boldwood harshly,
---
, she drove across the hilltop in
 the wending way's which led downwards-- to oblivious
 obscurity,
---
The keen instincts of Bathsheba had perceived, and
---
that
 the farmer's staunch devotion to herself was still
---
she sympathized deeply.
---
quite depressed her this evening; had reminded
 her of her folly; she wished anew,.
---
as she had wished
 many months ago, for some means of making repara-
 tion for her fault
---
This point- blank query unmistakably confused her,
."

---
that
 she said,
---
she said,, but
---
","
 she said, gently.
---
." she said, hurriedly.

---
"." she said, and.
---
for a woman to define her feelings in language
 which is chiefly made by men to express theirs
---
" she said, quickly.
---
there is
 no fault to be found with you as a woman
---
She
 said,?
---
with some distress in her voice, for she remembered

---
me
 to be your wife, whatever comes
---
it stand in these simple words-- that in six
 years' time you will be my wife
---
She breathed; and?
---
if you value such an act of
 friendship from a woman who does n't esteem her-
 self as she did, and
---
Bathsheba was in a very peculiar state of mind,
.
---
It is hardly too much to
 say that she felt coerced by a force stronger than her
 own will, not only into the act of promising upon this
 singularly remote and vague matter, but into the emo-
 tion of fancying that she ought to promise.
---
to diminish,
 her anxiety and perplexity increased.

---
One day she was led by an accident into an oddly
 confidential dialogue with Gabriel about her difficulty

---
It afforded her a little relief-- of a dull and cheerless
 kind.
---
Then out came her trouble;
 and
---
before she was aware
---
she told him;
.
---
how she had again got into the toils
---
she said sadly," and
---
she continued, with reckless frank-
 ness;" and
---
that a watched woman must have very
 much circumspection to retain only a very little credit,
 and
---
" she
 said shortly.
---
the class of women I should seem!"

---
She did not reply at once, and."
---
She had spoken frankly, and
---
she would
 not allow
---
herself to recognize
---
Not that she would have
 listened to any such hypothesis.
---
O no-- for was n't
 she saying all the time that such thoughts of the future
 were improper, and
---
It would have
 seemed pretty and sweet, if no more; and then she
 would have shown how kind and inoffensive a woman's
" No" can sometimes be.
---
she had asked for
---
Bathsheba was at this time in her room,.
---
She had called for candles, and
---
Liddy
 entered and.

---
said Bathsheba, almost
 timidly.
---
said Liddy, who was going
 with her.

---
" said
 Bathsheba.
---
Does a woman keep her promise, Gabriel
---
If it is not inconvenient to her
---
" she may."
"-- Or rather an implied promise."

---
" I wo n't answer for her implying."
---
However, does
 a woman keep a promise, not to marry, but?
---
Now you
 know women better."

---
However, she may keep such a promise,."

---
" I have pressed her upon the subject, and, and
---
she inclines
, and
---
She has a notion that a woman
 should not marry within seven years of her husband's
 disappearance-- that her own self should n't, I mean--
 because his body was not found.
---
It may be merely
 this legal reason which influences her, or
---
she is reluctant to talk on the point-

---
Yet she has promised----."

---
that she will ratify an
 engagement to- night
---
Her meaning may be good; but
 there
---
-- she's young yet."

---
" She never promised me at that first time, and
---
hence
 she did not break her promise!
---
If she promises me
---
,
 she'll marry me
---
, Bathsheba is a woman to her word."
                      
---
there's really
 anything going on between her and Boldwood
---
whether she
 has encouraged him
---
I do n't answer for
 her.
---
that she was gwine
 to the party at his house to- night
---
This is the first
 time she has ever gone there
---
She's a handsome
 woman, Pennyways
---
, is she not?
---
when I set eyes upon her
---
How did she look
---
Oh, she took no great heed of me, ye may well
 fancy; but
---
she looked well enough, far's.
---
She had just got
 off her mare
---
to look at the last wring- down of cider for
 the year; she had been riding, and
---
so her colours were
 up and her breath rather quick,.
---
so that her bosom
 plimmed and feli- plimmed and feli- every time plain
 to my eye
---
her
 wringing down the cheese and
---
" Never mind me," says she.
---
Then Gabe
 brought her some of the new cider, and
---
she must
 needs go not in
 a nateral way at all."
---
Liddy," says.
---
she," bring indoors
 a few gallons, and
---
" Sergeant,
 I was no more to her than a morsel of scroffin the fuel
 house!"

---
She ca n't do without
 him, and.

---
" Ah baily she's a notch above you, and
---
said Bathsheba,
.

---
" she murmured.

---
said Bathsheba, gravely.

---
if I marry her-- and
---
your
 interest in her is more than that of bailiff for an em-
 ployer
---
It contained a woman's finger- ring, set
 all the way round with small diamonds, and.

---
A good wife is
 good, but
---
the best wife is not so good as no wife at all.

---
" There she is
 with plenty of money, and a house and farm, and
 horses, and comfort, and
---
I should
 have gone back to her the day after the fair,; and
---
that his wife
 would be in such a hurry to get rid of his name
---
She's bad enough for
 anything."

---
, for should Bathsheba and Troy become recon-

---
she likes you yet
---
that she knows nothing about it
---
that she shall
---
Poor young thing:
 I do pity her, if' tis true.
---
" What a fool she must have been ever!
---
She is."

---
it
 serves her right than pity her
---
She was
---
no
 otherwise than a girl mind, and how could she tell?
---
than she ought
---
If so be' tis not
 true,' twill flurry her, and do her much harm; and
---
if so be' tis true,' twill do no good to forestall
 her time o' trouble.
---
though Henery Fray and some of'em do speak against
 her
---
, she's never been anything but fair to me.
---
She's
 hot and hasty, but
---
she's a brave girl who'll never tell a
 lie however much
---
the truth may harm her, and."

---
I've no
 cause to wish her evil
---
" She never do tell women's little lies.
---
she thinks
---
Ay, all the
 harm she says to yer face:."

---
there's nothing
 underhand wi' her
---
she'll come, or
---
the light shone upon Bathsheba coming up the
 path
---
as she met
 him
---
The spree is all in her honour,
---
she not care a bit about en
---
The
 air was big with Bathsheba's fortunes to- night: .
---
every
 word everywhere concerned her
---
that she's quite in the dark, and
---
Laban, you know her
 best
---
Per-
 haps she wo n't come and."

---
Bathsheba had been perplexed
,
---
for she was not much more than a slim
 young maid herself, and
---
the weight of stateliness sat
 heavy upon her.
---
Sometimes she thought
---
she ought

---
not to have come under any circumstances; then she
 considered what cold unkindness that would have been,
 and.

---
Her allotted hour having been passed in chatting
 and looking on
---
, Bathsheba told Liddy, and.

---
she had
---
Her
 manner was restive,."
---
for she remembered her promise,
 and
---
she added,"."

---
Bathsheba silently looked on the floor.

---
" What?" she whispered.

---
that it was the only tone in which
 she would allow him to approach her
---
" said Bathsheba;".
---
But I am a changed woman-- an unhappy
 woman-- and not-- not-- --"

---
" You are still a very beautiful woman
---
Honesty and pure conviction suggested the remark,
 unaccompanied by any perception that it might have
 been adopted by blunt flattery to soothe and win her.

---
for she said,

---
which was in itself a proof of
 her words
---
she said,.
---
her
 bosom beginning
---
; I was in
 agony, Bathsheba, and
---
The trimmings of her dress,, showed.'
---
how agitated she was, and
---
at last she
 burst out
---
she
 sobbed,.

---
when she had power to frame the words
---
she said
 solemnly.

---
she ex-
 claimed, on seeing what he held
---
In her trouble at not being able to get her hand away
 from him at once, she stamped passionately on the floor
 with one foot, and
---
tears crowded to her eyes again.

---
she said,.
---
as if her heart
 would break
---
Bathsheba sat down in a chair, and.
---
At length she said, in a sort of hopeless whisper--
" Very well, then, I will to- night,.
---
""
 she said,.

---
it to drop
 in her lap
---
she might
 be sufficiently composed sent one of the maids to her
 Bathsheba
---
as she
 best could, followed the girl, and
---
before doing so she paused on the bottom of
 the staircase which descended into one corner,.

---
"" the farmer asked
 Bathsheba, across the room.

---
" I do n't in the least," said Bathsheba.

---
said Bathsheba.
---
" A stranger?" she said.

---
Nobody noted
 Bathsheba.
---
She was leaning on the stairs.
---
Her brow
 had heavily contracted
---
; her whole face was pallid, her
 lips apart
---
, her eyes rigidly staring at their visitor.

---
The poor girl's wretched-
 ness at this time was beyond all fancy or narration.

---
She had sunk down on the lowest stair; and
---
there
 she sat, her mouth blue and dry, and.

---
as if she wondered
---
She made no reply.

---
Bathsheba moved her feet a little, but.

---
Nevertheless, she did not move.
---
that Bathsheba was beyond the pale of activity-- and
 yet not in a swoon
---
She was in a state of mental GUTTA
 SERENA
---
; her mind was for the minute at the same time
---
when she quickly shrank back
---
at the moment of his seizure she writhed, and
---
When Bathsheba had cried out in her husband's
 grasp
---
As for
 Bathsheba, she had changed.
---
She was sitting on the
 floor beside the body of Troy,.
---
where she had herself lifted it
---
With one hand she
 held her handkerchief to his breast and
---
with the other she tightly clasped one of
 his.
---
The household convulsion had made her herself
 again.
---
Bathsheba was astonishing all around her
 now, for her philosophy
---
she
 seldom thought practicable what she did not practise.

---
She was of the stuff of which great men's mothers
 are made.
---
She was indispensable to high generation,
,, and.

---
" she said, automatically,
---
Her statement of the fact in such quiet and simple
 words came with more force than a tragic declamation,
 and.
---
She's had
---
She had no
 right to do that."
---
she should have waited."

---
" Yes, sir; it was hinted to her.
---
that she had
---
But she said."

---
law was
 nothing to her, and
---
she would n't let her dear husband's
 corpse bide neglected for folks to stare at for all the
 crowners in England
---
Mr. Aldritch drove at once back again up the
 hill to Bathsheba's.
---
The first person was
 poor Liddy, who seemed literally to have dwindled
 smaller in these few latter hours.
---
" said Liddy, with suspended
 breath.
---
" My mistress has done it all."
" Where is she?"

---
taken upstairs, she said.
---
she wanted no
 further help from the men
---
And then she called me,
 and and.

---
Then she locked herself into the room alone with him,
 and.

---
she
 should want me
---
her moving about inside
 for more than an  hour
---
she only came out once,
 and.
---
She said."

---
her
 know
---
Liddy knocked, and

---
Bathsheba's dress was heard
---
she opened the door.

---
Her looks were calm and nearly rigid, like a slightly
 animated bust of Melpomene.

---
" she
 murmured from her lips merely, and."
---
She then
 passed by him,.

---
she had vacated

---
" as she says.
---
She must have the
 nerve of a stoic!"

---
The heart of a wife merely." floated in a whisper
 about the ears of the three, and turning.
---
they saw
 Bathsheba in the midst of them
---
as if at that
 instant to prove that her fortitude had been more of
 will than of spontaneity
---
Then,, she silently sank down between
 them and.

---
They took her away into a further room, and
---
the
 medical attendance was invaluable in Bathsheba's, who fell into a
 series of fainting- fits that had a serious aspect for a
 time.
---
Liddy
 kept watch in Bathsheba's chamber,
---
where she heard
 her mistress, moaning in whispers through the dull
 slow hours of that wretched night:"
---
There were several sets of ladies"
 dresses in the piece, of sundry expensive materials;
 silks and satins, poplins and velvets, all of colours
 which from Bathsheba's style of dress might have been
 judged to be her favourites.
---
" Is she downstairs?"

---
as she was too
---
She's but very little better.
---
now again than she was at
 Christmas
---
She keeps on.

---
said Liddy.

---
", she'll go out of her mind too.
---
Poor thing;
 her sufferings have been dreadful
---
; she deserves any-
 body's pity."

---
" Is she altered much?"
---
,
 you would n't know her.
---
"" said Liddy.
---
" Her eyes are so
 miserable that she's not the same woman.
---
Only two
 years ago she was a romping girl,
---
and now she's this!"

---
-- AFTER ALL


 BATHSHEBA revived with the spring.
---
that had followed the low fever from which
 she had suffered diminished perceptibly when all un-
 certainty upon every subject had come to an end
---
But she remained alone now for the greater part of
 her time, and.
---
She shunned every one, even Liddy,
 and.

---
she passed more of her time
 in the open air, and.

---
though she never rode
 out or
---
One Friday evening in August she walked a little way
 along the road and.

---
the jet black
 of her gown, till it appeared preternatural.
---
When she
 reached a little shop at the other end of the place,
 which stood nearly opposite to the churchyard
---
she knew
.
---
She crossed the road,
.
---
, the high
 sills of the church windows effectually screening her
 from the eyes of those gathered within
---
Her stealthy
 walk was to the nook wherein Troy had worked at
 planting flowers upon Fanny Robin's grave, and
---
she
 came to the marble tombstone.

---
A motion of satisfaction enlivened her face.
---
as she
 read the complete inscription
---
she stood and
---
she went
 with the same light step round to the porch and.

---
Bathsheba was stirred by emotions which
 latterly she had assumed to be altogether dead within
 her.
---
The little attenuated voices of the children
 brought to her ear in destinct utterance the words they
 sang without thought or comprehension--
 Lead, kindly Light, amid the encircling gloom,
.

---
Bathsheba's feeling was always to some extent de-
 pendent upon her whim,.
---
as is the case with many other
 women
---
Something big came into her throat and an
 uprising to her eyes-- and
---
she thought.
---
that she would
 allow
---
They
 did flow and plenteously, and one fell upon the stone
 bench beside her.
---
Once that she had begun.
---
she hardly knew
---
what, she could not leave off for
---
she knew too well
---
She would have given
 anything in the world to be,.

---
All the impassioned scenes of her brief expenence
 seemed and
---
Yet grief came
 to her rather as a luxury than as the scourge of former
 times.

---
Owing to Bathsheba's face being buried in her hands
 she did not notice a form which came quietly into the
 porch, and
---
Bathsheba did not raise
 her head for some time, and
---
when she looked round

---
her face was wet, and
---
her eyes drowned and dim."
---
she, disconcerted,"
---
" said Bathsheba; and
---
Bathsheba trying
---
her dreadfully drenched and
 inflamed face without his noticing her
---
" No." she said.
---
" Leaving England!" she said, in surprise and
 genuine disappointment.
---
she could follow on no pretence whatever.

---
Bathsheba went home,.
---
her mind occupied with a
 new trouble, which being rather harassing than deadly
 was calculated to do good by diverting her from the
 chronic gloom of her life
---
She was set; and
---
when singly viewed
 amounted together to a perceptible disinclination for
 her society.
---
It broke upon her at length as a great
 pain.
---
that her last old disciple was about to forsake her
 and flee
---
who had believed in her and
---
when all the rest of the world was against her
---
She noticed
.
---
when she was likely
 to be there, only entering at unseasonable hours when
 her presence in that part of the house was least to be
 expected
---
Poor Bathsheba began.

---
that she was
 despised
---
Christmas- day came,, and two years
 and a quarter of her life alone.
---
On examining her
 heart it appeared beyond measure strange
---
that everybody abjured her-- for what she could
 not tell-- and
---
Coming out of church that day she looked
 round in hope.
---
she had

---
The next morning brought the culminating stroke;
 she had been expecting it long.
---
Bathsheba actually sat and.
---
She was aggrieved and
---
which she had

---
She was bewildered too by the prospect of having
 to rely on her own resources again
---
: it seemed to herself
.
---
that she never could again acquire energy sufficient to
 go to market, barter, and sell
---
What should
 she do now?
---
Her life was becoming a desolation.

---
So desolate was Bathsheba this evening,
---
that in an
 absolute hunger for pity and sympathy, and miserable in
 that she appeared
---
she had ever owned
---
, she put on her bonnet and
 cloak and.

---
guided on her way by the pale primrose rays of a
 crescent moon a few days old
---
She tapped nervously, and
.
---
for a single
 woman to call upon a bachelor who lived alone, although
 he was her manager
---
she might be supposed
---
said Bathsheba, faintly.

---
she said, in pathetic tones.

---
So down she sat, and
---
In the fields, or at her house,
 there had never been any embarrassment; but now that
 Oak had become the entertainer their lives seemed to be
 moved back again to the days when they were strangers.

---
" she asked, gladly."
---
What?" said Bathsheba, in surprise.
---
Bathsheba did not look."
---
as if a
 cannon had been discharged by her ear, which was what
 Oak had expected
---
she said, quietly.
---
she returned, with tears
 in her eyes."
---
" she murmured.

---
" she interrupted.
---
Now, Bathsheba, was ever
---
"" she exclaimed, thank-
 fully,.
---
as she rose from her seat
---
" she said, with a slight
 laugh,
---
" I've danced at
 your skittish heels, my beautiful Bathsheba, for many a
 long mile, and many a long day; and
---
Bathsheba has a great wish that all
 the parish shall not be in church, looking at her
---
-- she's
 shylike and nervous about it, in fact--."

---
Labe Tall's old woman will horn it all over parish in
 half- an- hour."

---
" So she will, upon my life; I never thought of
 that."
---
how we could tackle her
---
She'll never guess en for; and
---
Mrs.
 Tall herself opened it.

---
before she could ask
---
said Bathsheba, on going to bed that night,

---
CONCLUSION
 Bathsheba, however, awoke voluntarily at four, nor
.
---
About
 six, being quite positive that her watch had stopped
 during the night
---
, she could wait no longer.
---
She went
 and.

---
after some labour awoke
 her
---
said
 the bewildered Liddy.
---
When Liddy came to Bathsheba's room
---
her mistress
 was already waiting.
---
Liddy could not understand
 this extraordinary promptness.
---
"" she said.

---
said Bathsheba, with a mischiev-
 ous smile in her bright eyes."
---
" A woman's good name is
 such a perishable article that-- --"
 Bathsheba laughed with a flushed cheek, and
 whispered in Liddy's ear, although there was nobody
 present.
---
Then Liddy stared and!
---
" said Bathsheba.

---
Yet, though so plainly dressed
 there was a certain rejuvenated appearance about her: --
  .

---
Repose had again incarnadined her cheeks; and
---
as
 she had worn it years ago on Norcombe Hill
---
, she seemed
 in his eyes remarkably like a girl of that fascinating
 dream, which, considering that she was now only three
 or four- and- twenty, was perhaps not very wonderful.
---
The two sat down very quietly to tea in Bathsheba's
 parlour in the evening of the same day,.

---
whilst Bathsheba was, comparatively, in a plethora of all
 three
---
Just as Bathsheba was pouring out a cup of tea
---
followed by Bathsheba
---
I was saying so to my
 wife but
---
"" standing pipe" my wife" in a more used note
 than' a did said Jacob Smallbury.
---
Bathsheba smiled(), and
---
for she
 never laughed readily now
---
I wish him joy o' her
