because she
 need n't finish it, and
---
Its singularity lay less in the retention of a custom of
 walking in procession and dancing on each anniversary than in the
 members being solely women. 
---
either the natural shyness of the
 softer sex, or a sarcastic attitude on the part of male relatives,
 had denuded such women's clubs) or this
 their glory and consummation. 
---
In addition to the distinction of a white frock, every woman and girl
 carried in her right hand a peeled willow wand, and
---
There were a few middle- aged and even elderly women in the train,
 their silver- wiry hair and wrinkled faces, scourged by time and
 trouble, having almost a grotesque, certainly a pathetic, appearance
 in such a jaunty situation. 
---
when she should say,"
---
The young girls formed, indeed, the majority of the band, and their
 heads of luxuriant hair reflected in the sunshine every tone of gold,
 and black, and brown. 
---
that they were genuine country girls, unaccustomed to many
 eyes
---
each
 had a private little sun for her soul to bask in; some dream, some
 affection, some hobby, at least some remote and distant hope which,
 though perhaps starving to nothing, still lived on, as hopes will.

---
A young member of the band turned her head at the exclamation.

---
She was a fine and handsome girl-- not handsomer than some others,
 possibly-- but
---
her mobile peony mouth and large innocent eyes added
 eloquence to colour and shape. 
---
She wore a red ribbon in her hair,
 and. 
---
As she looked round
---
driven
 by a frizzle- headed brawny damsel with her gown- sleeves
---
This was the cheerful servant of that establishment,
 who, in her part of factotum, turned groom and ostler at times.

---
The clubbists tittered, except the girl called Tess--.


---
," she said hastily," and
---
" Bless thy simplicity, Tess," said her companions. 
---
Tess cried, and
---
the colour upon her cheeks spread over
 her face and neck. 
---
In a moment her eyes grew moist, and
---
her glance
 drooped to the ground. 
---
that they had really pained her

---
Tess's pride would not
 allow; and
---
her to turn her head again,
---
thus she moved on with the whole body to the
 enclosure where there was to be dancing on the green. 
---
she has recovered her equanimity, and
---
The dialect was on her tongue
 to some extent, despite the village school: the characteristic
 intonation of that dialect for this district being the voicing
 approximately rendered by the syllable UR, probably as rich an
 utterance as any to be found in human speech. 
---
her lower lip had a way of thrusting the
 middle of her top one upward,.


---
Phases of her childhood lurked in her aspect still. 
---
As she walked
 along to- day
---
, for all her bouncing handsome womanliness, you could
 sometimes see her twelfth year in her cheeks, or her ninth sparkling
 from her eyes; and even her fifth.


---
A small minority,
 mainly strangers, would look long at her in casually passing by, and

---
momentarily fascinated by her freshness
---
if they
 would ever see her again
---
to almost everybody she was a fine and
 picturesque country girl, and no more.


---
, the girls danced at first with each other, but
---
the spectacle of a bevy of girls dancing without male partners
 seemed, and. 
---
said a shyer girl.


---
Pedigree, ancestral skeletons,
 monumental record, the d'Urberville lineaments, did not help Tess in
 her life's battle as yet, even to the extent of attracting to her a
 dancing- partner over the heads of the commonest peasantry. 
---
The name of the eclipsing girl,, has not been handed
 down; but
---
she was envied by all as the first who enjoyed the luxury
 of a masculine partner that evening. 
---
the plainest woman in the club was no longer

---
,
 whose own large orbs wore,, the faintest aspect of
 reproach that he had not chosen her. 
---
it to be the pretty
 maiden with whom he had not danced
---
that she was hurt by his oversight
---
She
 was so modest, so expressive
---
, she had looked so soft in her thin
 white gown.


---
III


 As for Tess Durbeyfield, she did not so easily dislodge the incident
 from her consideration. 
---
She had no spirit to dance again for a long
 time,; but
---
though she might have had plenty of partners
---
till the rays of the sun had absorbed the young stranger's retreating
 figure on the hill that she shook off her temporary sadness and

---
She remained with her comrades till dusk, and
---
, she
 enjoyed treading a measure purely for its own sake
---
when she saw" the soft torments, the bitter sweets, the pleasing
 pains, and the agreeable distresses" of those girls who had been
 wooed and won
---
though, being heart- whole as yet; little divining
, what she herself was capable of in that kind. 
---
The
 struggles and wrangles of the lads for her hand in a jig were an
 amusement to her-- no more; and
---
she rebuked
 them.


---
She might have stayed even later, but the incident of her father's
 odd appearance and manner returned upon the girl's mind to make her
 anxious, and wondering what had become of him she dropped away from
 the dancers and bent her steps towards the end of the village at
 which the parental cottage lay.


---
she
 had quitted
---
While yet many score yards off, other rhythmic sounds than those became audible to her
---
that she knew well-- so
 well
---
when Tess
 opened the door and
---
The interior, in spite of the melody, struck upon the girl's senses
 with an unspeakable dreariness. 
---
Besides the jar of contrast there came to her a chill
 self- reproach that she had not returned sooner, to help her mother
 in these domesticities, instead of indulging herself out- of- doors.


---
There stood her mother amid the group of children,,. 
---
as Tess had left
 her
---
Tess felt it with a dreadful sting of remorse-- the very white
 frock upon her back which she had so carelessly greened about the
 skirt on the damping grass-- which had been wrung up and ironed by her
 mother's own hands.


---
the other being engaged in the aforesaid business of rocking her
 youngest child
---
excited by her
 song
---
that was left in her after
 a long day's seething in the suds
---
Tess's mother caught up its notation in a week.


---
There still faintly beamed from the woman's features something of
 the freshness, and even the prettiness, of her youth;
---
which Tess could boast of
---
that the personal charms were in
 main part her mother's gift
---
Her mother bore Tess no ill- will for leaving the housework to her
 single- handed efforts for so long. 
---
; indeed, Joan seldom upbraided

---
her thereon at any time, feeling but slightly the lack of Tess's
 assistance whilst her instinctive plan for relieving herself of her
 labours lay in postponing them
---
To- night, however, she was even in a
 blither mood than usual. 
---
There was a dreaminess, a pre- occupation,
 an exaltation, in the maternal look which the girl could not
 understand.


---
" Or I'll take off my best frock and?  I thought."

" Well, I'm glad you've come," her mother said, as soon as the last
 note had passed out of her. 
---
" I want;
 but
---
, I want. 
---
; her daughter,,
 spoke two languages: the dialect at home, more or less; ordinary
 English abroad and to persons of quality.)


---
" Since I've been away?"
---
Tess asked.


---
I felt inclined to
 sink into the ground with shame!"


---
" I'm glad of that. 
---
Will it do us any good, mother?"


---
Her mother gave irrelevant information by way of answer:" He called
 to see the doctor to- day in Shaston. 
---
as she spoke
---
Tess looked alarmed. 
---
she asked again.


---
Her mother put on a deprecating look. 
---
" Get up his strength!" said Tess impetuously,. 
---
the tears welling to
 her eyes
---
Her rebuke and her mood seemed, and.


---
I be not agreed
---
I have been
 waiting for' ee to bide and keep house while I go fetch him."


---
" I'll go."


---
Tess did not expostulate. 
---
She knew. 
---
" And take the_ Compleat Fortune- Teller_ to the outhouse," Joan
 continued,.


---
_ was an old thick volume, which lay on a
 table at her elbow, so worn by pocketing that the margins had reached
 the edge of the type. 
---
Tess took it up, and
---
her mother started.


---
She felt a
 little.


---
as she had used
---
when she sat by her
---
Tess, being left alone with the younger children,. 
---
A curious fetishistic fear of this grimy volume on the part
 of her mother prevented her, and
---
Between the mother, with her fast- perishing lumber of superstitions,
 folk- lore, dialect, and orally transmitted ballads, and the daughter,
 with her trained National teachings and Standard knowledge under an
 infinitely Revised Code, there was a gap of two hundred years. 
---
Tess mused on what the mother could
 have wished to ascertain from the book on this particular day. 
---
She
 guessed the recent ancestral discovery, but. 
---
Dismissing this, however,
 she busied herself with sprinkling the linen dried during the
 day- time, in company with her nine- year- old brother Abraham, and
---
her
 sister Eliza- Louisa of twelve and a half, called"' Liza- Lu,. 
---
There was an interval of four years
 and more between Tess and the next of the family,
---
this lent her a
 deputy- maternal attitude. 
---
when she was alone with her juniors
---
Tess looked
 out of the door, and. 
---
: she could inwardly behold the extinguisher and the
 extended hand.


---
Her mother's fetching simply meant. 
---
Tess began to
 perceive that a man in indifferent health, who proposed to start on a
 journey before one in the morning, ought not to be at an inn at this
 late hour celebrating his ancient blood.


---
" Abraham," she said to her little brother,"."


---
" I must go myself
---
," she said.


---
Tess, locking them all in, started on
 her way up the dark and crooked lane or street not made for hasty
 progress; a street laid out before inches of land had value, and
---
Her ascent of the
 crooked staircase was a slower process, and
---
her face,, encountered the gaze of all the party
 assembled in the bedroom.


---
while she peered over
 the stairs
---
She nudged him,
---
She
 dropped her public voice, and
---
She repeated the information. 
---
," she
 said. 
---
But she's nothing beside
 we-- a junior branch of us, no doubt,.
---
" She is rich, and
---
she'd be sure to take notice o' the maid,"
 continued Mrs Durbeyfield;" and. 
---
when Tess has gone
---
we'll ride in her coach and!"


---
Well,
 Tess ought. 
---
She'd be sure
 to win the lady--
---
Tess would; and
---
how pretty she looked to- day
---
In short, I know it."

" I tried her fate in the_ Fortune- Teller_, and;
 her skin is as sumple as a duchess'."


---
" What says the maid herself to going?"


---
She do n't know. 
---
But it would certainly put her in the way of a grand marriage,
 and
---
she wo n't say nay to going.
---
" I've not asked her. " Tess is queer."


---
" But she's tractable at bottom. 
---
that
 the Durbeyfields had weightier concerns to talk of now than common
 folks had, and that Tess, their pretty eldest daughter, had fine
 prospects in store
---
Tess is a fine figure o' fun,
---
that she
 do n't get green malt in floor
---
she kept on hand for intruders.


---
before she recognized
---
that
 the newcomer was Tess
---
Even to her mother's gaze the girl's young features looked sadly
 out of place amid the alcoholic vapours which floated here as
 no unsuitable medium for wrinkled middle- age; and
---
Tess holding one arm of her father, and Mrs
 Durbeyfield the other
---
The two women valiantly
 disguised these forced excursions and countermarches as well as they
 could from Durbeyfield, their cause, and from Abraham, and from
 themselves; and
---
," said his wife. 
---
I was never of no family, and!"


---
Tess turned the subject by saying what was far more prominent in her
 own mind at the moment than thoughts of her ancestry--"I am afraid
 father wo n't be able to take the journey with the beehives to- morrow
 so early."


---
I shall be all right in an hour or two
---
"," she said to her eldest daughter, whose great
 eyes had opened the moment her mother's hand touched the door.


---
Tess sat up in bed,.


---
"," she replied. 
---
One of them," she presently suggested.


---
" O no-- I would n't have it for the world!"
---
I think
---
I_ could go."


---
Her mother at length agreed to this arrangement. 
---
Meanwhile Tess had hastily dressed herself; and
---
the girl led out the horse, Prince, only a degree
 less rickety than the vehicle.


---
" What?" said Tess,.


---
" I heard. 
---
when I went
---
mother said."


---
that kin with the lady, she'd put' ee in
 the way of marrying a gentleman
---
If Tess were made
 rich by marrying a gentleman
---
, would she have money enough to buy a
 spyglass so large that it would draw the stars as near to her as
 Nettlecombe- Tout?


---
The renewed subject, to have impregnated the whole
 family, filled Tess with impatience.


---
she exclaimed.


---
mother
 would n't have been always washing, and."

"
---
Tess was not
 skilful in the management of a horse, but
---
she thought. 
---
that she could
 take upon herself the entire conduct of the load for the present and

---
She made him a
 sort of nest in front of the hives, in such a manner,.


---
With no longer a companion to distract her,
 Tess fell more deeply into reverie than ever,. 
---
The mute procession past her shoulders of trees
 and hedges became attached to fantastic scenes outside reality, and

---
Then, examining the mesh of events in her own life, she seemed
---
she no longer knew. 
---
A sudden jerk shook her in her seat, and
---
Tess awoke
 from the sleep into which she, too, had fallen.


---
They were a long way further on than when she had lost consciousness,
 and
---
she had

---
A hollow groan, unlike anything ever heard in her life,!"


---
The lantern hanging at her waggon had gone out, but. 
---
The
 morning mail- cart, with its two noiseless wheels, speeding along
 these lanes like an arrow,, had driven into her slow
 and unlighted equipage. 
---
In her despair Tess sprang forward and. 
---
that she became splashed from face to skirt
---
Then she stood. 
---
while Tess stood and
---
Tess showed hers, still whiter. 
---
The huge pool of blood in front of
 her was already assuming the iridescence of coagulation; and
---
the girl cried,. 
---
What will mother and father
 live on now? 
---
She shook the child, who had slept soundly
 through the whole disaster. 
---
she went on to herself.

---
Tess had gone back earlier. 
---
How to break the news was more than she
 could think. 
---
It was a relief to her tongue, though this did not
 lessen the self- reproach which she continued to heap upon herself for
 her negligence.


---
In the Durbeyfield countenances
 there was nothing of the red wrath that would have burnt upon the
 girl from parents more ambitious for her welfare. 
---
Nobody blamed Tess
.


---
as she blamed herself
---
Her face was dry and pale,.




---
as though she
 regarded herself in the light of a murderess
---
who had dragged her parents into this
 quagmire
---
Tess, meanwhile, as the one, was silently wondering; and
---
what she could do
---
then her mother broached her scheme.


---
," said she;" and
---
You must go to her and, and.
---
" I should n't care
---
to do that," says Tess. 
---
if she were friendly
---
"

" You could win her round. 
---
I've heard."


---
what I've heard,
 good- now
---
she had done
---
The oppressive sense of the harm led Tess; but
---
than she might otherwise have been to the maternal
 wish
---
she could not understand. 
---
why her mother should find such
 satisfaction in contemplating an enterprise of, to her, such doubtful
 profit
---
Her mother might have made inquiries, and. 
---
But Tess's pride made the part of poor relation one of
 particular distaste to her.


---
" I'd rather try,
---
to get work" she murmured.


---
"," said his wife,. 
---
she ought
---
" to go, she will go."


---
I do n't like
---
" I'm the head of the noblest branch o'
 the family, and
---
I ought."


---
as I killed the horse, mother
---
" Well,," she said
 mournfully,
---
" I suppose. 
---
I ought
---
I do n't mind, but
---
her making a match for me
---
Rising early next day she walked to the hill- town called Shaston,
 and
---
there took advantage of a van which twice in the week ran from
 Shaston eastward to Chaseborough, passing near Trantridge, the parish
 in which the vague and mysterious Mrs d'Urberville had her residence.


---
The Vale of Blackmoor was to her the
 world, and its inhabitants the races thereof. 
---
From the gates and
 stiles of Marlott she had looked down its length in the wondering
 days of infancy, and
---
what had been mystery to her then
---
was not
 much less than mystery to her now. 
---
She had seen daily from her
 chamber- window towers, villages, faint white mansions; above all,
 the town of Shaston standing majestically on its height; its windows
 shining like lamps in the evening sun. 
---
She had hardly ever visited
 the place, only a small tract even of the Vale and its environs being
 known to her by close inspection. 
---
Much less had she been far outside
 the valley. 
---
Every contour of the surrounding hills was as personal
 to her as that of her relatives' faces; but
---
for, her
 judgment was dependent on the teaching of the village school, where
 she had held a leading place at the time of her leaving, a year or
 two before this date.


---
In those early days she had been much loved by others of her own
 sex and age, and; Tess the middle one-- in a pink print pinafore, of a finely
 reticulated pattern, worn over a stuff frock that had lost its
 original colour for a nondescript tertiary-- marching on upon long
 stalky legs, in tight stockings which had little ladder- like holes
 at the knees, torn by kneeling in the roads and banks in search of
 vegetable and mineral treasures; her then earth- coloured hair hanging
 like pot- hooks; the arms of the two outside girls resting round the
 waist of Tess; her arms on the shoulders of the two supporters.


---
As Tess grew older, and
---
began to see, she felt
 quite a Malthusian towards her mother for thoughtlessly giving her so
 many little sisters and brothers, when it was such a trouble to nurse
 and provide for them. 
---
Her mother's intelligence was that of a happy
 child
---
However, Tess became humanely beneficent towards the small ones,
 and
---
she used
---
as she left
 school
---
which she had learnt
---
it was a kind of work in which she excelled.


---
that Tess should be the representative of the
 Durbeyfields at the d'Urberville mansion.

---
She alighted from the van at Trantridge Cross, and
---
as she had been informed
---
Tess thought.

---
its door being towards her
---
Her feet had brought her onward to
 this point; and
---
before she had quite realized
---
where she was
---
now all
 was contrary to her expectation.


---
she said, in
 her artlessness. 
---
She wished.



---
that she had not fallen in so readily
 with her mother's plans for" claiming kin," and gain assistance nearer home
---
Of this work of imagination poor Tess and her parents were naturally
 in ignorance-- much to their discomfiture; indeed, the very
 possibility of such annexations was unknown to them;
---
Tess still stood,. 
---
that she stood
---
She had dreamed of an aged and dignified face, the sublimation of
 all the d'Urberville lineaments, furrowed with incarnate memories
 representing in hieroglyphic the centuries of her family's and
 England's history. 
---
But she screwed herself up to the work in hand,

---
since she could not get out of it, and answered--


---
-- she is an invalid
---
What is the business you wish to see her about?"


---
" she stammered;"
---
" Mother asked me,". 
---
Tess continued;" and
---
, indeed, I was in the
 mind
---
But I did not think. 
---
I came, sir,."


---
" Ay, ay; I mean d'Urbervilles.
---
But it
 is so worn that mother uses it to stir the pea- soup.
---
" And so mother said."


---
" Very kind of your mother, I'm sure. 
---
And I, for one, do n't regret
 her step." 
---
" I suppose.


---
I have,
---
" faltered Tess,
---
She gave him brief particulars; and
---
that she was intending
---
who
 had brought her
---
Tess wished; but
---
she consented. 
---
" Yes," said Tess,"."


---
she said quickly,. 
---
" I would rather take it in my own hand."


---
in a slight distress she parted her lips
 and.


---
They had spent some time, Tess eating in
 a half- pleased, half- reluctant state whatever d'Urberville offered
 her. 
---
When she could consume no more of the strawberries he filled
 her little basket with them
---
She obeyed like one in a dream, and
---
when she could affix. 
---
She had an attribute which amounted
 to a disadvantage just now; and
---
her appear more
 of a woman than she really was
---
She had inherited the feature from
 her mother without the quality it denoted. 
---
It had troubled her mind
 occasionally,.


---
till her companions had said
---
She soon had finished her lunch. 
---
" Now I am going home, sir," she
 said,.


---
she answered,. 
---
her eyes filling with tears
---
as she
 gave particulars of Prince's death
---
" And I do n't know!"


---
" I must think. 
---
if I can not do something
---
My mother must find a berth
 for you. 
---
" I wish for no better, sir,
---
" said she with something of dignity.


---
her go
---
Had she perceived this meeting's import
---
she
 might have asked; yet to him.


---
she was doomed
---
who amongst her acquaintance might have
 approximated to this kind,
---
she was but a transient impression, half
 forgotten
---
Nature does not often say!" to her poor
 creature at a time when seeing can lead to happy doing; or reply
" Here!" to a body's cry of" Where?". 
---
" Well, I'm damned! 
---
VI


 Tess went down the hill to Trantridge Cross, and.

---
She did not know,
; and
---
what the other occupants said to her
---
as she entered
---
though she answered them
---
she rode
 along with an inward and not an outward eye.


---
One among her fellow- travellers addressed her more pointedly than

---
Then she became aware of the spectacle she presented to their
 surprised vision
---
She blushed, and

---
that the flowers had been given to her
---
she stealthily removed the more prominent
 blooms from her hat and. 
---
where she covered
 them with her handkerchief
---
Then she fell to reflecting again, and

---
Like all the cottagers in Blackmoor
 Vale, Tess was steeped in fancies and prefigurative superstitions
---
;
 she thought this an ill omen--
---
the first she had noticed that day.


---
Her mother had advised her, at
 the house of a cottage- woman they knew,; and
---
if she should feel too tired

---
this Tess did,
---
When she entered the house she perceived in a moment from her
 mother's triumphant manner that something had occurred in the
 interim.


---
" Oh yes; I know all about it! 
---
I told' ee and
? 
---
Since I've been away
---
?" said Tess rather wearily.


---
Her mother surveyed the girl up and down with arch approval, and!"


---
" I've had a letter."


---
Tess then remembered.


---
that she wants
---
you to look after a
 little fowl- farm which is her hobby
---
But this is only her artful way
 of getting' ee there without raising your hopes. 
---
She's going
---
" But I did n't see her."


---
", I suppose?
---
" I saw her son."


---
" An' I knew it! 
---
she do want
' ee there."


---
" But I do n't know
---
that I am apt at tending fowls
---
," said the dubious
 Tess.


---
" Then I do n't know. 
---
" I do n't altogether think
---
I ought
---
to go," said Tess thoughtfully.

---
that her daughter's services would be useful to that lady
 in the management of her poultry- farm,
---
that a comfortable room would
 be provided for her, and
---
if she could come
---
if they liked her
---
said Tess.


---
her to throw her arms round' ee,
---
Tess looked out of the window.


---
" I would rather stay here with father and you
---
," she said.


---
" I'd rather not tell you why, mother;
---
indeed, I do n't quite know
 why."


---
A week afterwards she came in one evening from an unavailing search
 for some light occupation in the immediate neighbourhood. 
---
Her idea
 had been. 
---
Hardly had she crossed the threshold before
 one of the children danced across the room,!"


---
Her mother hastened. 
---
if Tess could really
 come
---
you must be a good girl
---
Tess seemed for the moment really pleased to hear that she had won
 such high opinion from a stranger when, in her own esteem, she had
 sunk so low.


---
that," she murmured
---
if I was
 quite sure how it would be living there
---
, I would go any- when."


---
I do n't think so
---
"," said Tess coldly.


---
I'm sure he wears a
 beautiful diamond ring!"


---
" I'll think it over," said Tess,.


---
" Well, she's made a conquest o' the younger branch of us, straight
 off
---
she's a fool."


---
if she
 do n't follow it up
---
her go
---
then she'll be."


---
what
 her forefathers was
---
And
 have she really paid'em a visit to such an end as this?"


---
Meanwhile Tess was walking thoughtfully among the gooseberry- bushes
 in the garden, and over Prince's grave. 
---
When she came in her mother

---
" she asked.


---
" I wish
---
I had seen Mrs d'Urberville
---
," said Tess.


---
" I think. 
---
Then you'll see her soon
 enough."


---
" I do n't know!"
---
I killed the old horse, and
---
I suppose. 
---
I ought
---
who had made use of this idea of Tess being taken up by
 their wealthy kinsfolk( which they imagined the other family to be)
 as a species of dolorifuge after the death of the horse
---
Tess wo n't go- o- o and
---
" be made a la- a- dy of!--no, she says she
 wo- o- on't!
---
And Tess
 wo n't look pretty in her best cloze no mo- o- ore!"


---
Her mother chimed in to the same tune: a certain way she had of
 making her labours in the house seem heavier than they were by
 prolonging them indefinitely, also weighed in the argument. 
---
Her
 father alone preserved an attitude of neutrality.


---
I will go
---
"," said Tess at last.


---
Her mother could not repress her consciousness of the nuptial vision
 conjured up by the girl's consent.


---
For such a pretty maid as' tis, this is a fine
 chance!"


---
Tess smiled crossly.


---
" I hope. 
---
She was not quite sure that she did
 not feel proud enough, after the visitor's remarks, to say a good
 deal.


---
the young girl wrote,. 
---
on which she might be required
---
when she must hold herself
 prepared to start
---
" It might have been
 a carriage for her own kin!"


---
Having at last taken her course Tess was less restless
---
She had hoped, but
---
she did not regard Mrs Durbeyfield's
 matrimonial hopes for her in a serious aspect for a moment. 
---
The
 light- minded woman had been discovering good matches for her daughter
 almost from the year of her birth.

VII


 On the morning appointed for her departure
---
Tess was awake before
 dawn-- at the marginal minute of the dark. 
---
She
 remained upstairs, and
---
her Sunday apparel being carefully

---
Her mother expostulated.
---
" to see your folks
" But I am going!
---
to work" said Tess.


---
," she added.


---
," replied Tess with calm
 abandonment.


---
And to please her parent the girl put herself quite in Joan's hands,
."


---
First she fetched a great basin, and. 
---
She tied it with a broader pink ribbon than usual.

---
Then she put upon her the white frock that Tess had worn at the
 club- walking, the airy fulness of which, supplementing her enlarged
_
---
which
 belied her age, and
---
her to be estimated as a woman
---
when
 she was not much more than a child
---
" I declare!"
---
said Tess.


---
When I was a
 maid
---
as I had a pretty bonnet
---
she cried. 
---
As the looking- glass was only large enough to reflect a very small
 portion of Tess's person at one time
---
After this
 she went downstairs to her husband, who was sitting in the lower
 room.


---
" I'll tell' ee
---
what' tis, Durbeyfield," said she exultingly;
---
she has got
---
She is such an odd maid that it mid zet her against him, or against
. 
---
, I shall certainly be for
 making some return to pa'son at Stagfoot Lane for telling us-- dear,
 good man!"


---
the girl's setting out
---
that she would walk a little way-- as far as to the point where
 the acclivity from the valley began its first steep ascent to
 the outer world
---
her box had already
 been wheeled ahead towards this summit by a lad with trucks, to be in
 readiness.


---
their mother put on her bonnet
---
" I do want
---
to walk a little- ways wi' Sissy, now she's going!"


---
" Now," said Tess, flushing and turning quickly,"
---
I'll hear no more o'
 that! 
---
" Goodbye, father," said Tess, with a lumpy throat.


---
And tell'n, Tess, that being sunk,
 quite, from our former grandeur, I'll sell him the title-- yes, sell
 it--
---
Tess's eyes were too full and
---
her voice too choked. 
---
that were in her
---
She turned quickly, and.


---
So the girls and their mother all walked together, a child on each
 side of Tess,; her mother
 just behind with the smallest; the group forming a picture of honest
 beauty flanked by innocence, and backed by simple- souled vanity.

---
till they reached the beginning of the ascent,
 on the crest of which the vehicle from Trantridge was to receive her,

---
that
 contained all Tess's worldly possessions
---
Her
 mother and the children thereupon decided, and

---
to go no farther bidding them a hasty goodbye, Tess bent her steps up the hill.


---
They saw her white shape draw near to the spring- cart, on which her
 box was already placed. 
---
before she had quite reached it another
 vehicle shot out from a clump of trees on the summit
---
Her mother perceived, for the first time,. 
---
Then she looked
 down
---
Could she be deceived as to the meaning of
 this?


---
Meanwhile the muslined form of Tess could be seen
---
whose owner was talking to her.

---
Her seeming indecision was, in fact, more than indecision
---
She would have preferred the humble cart. 
---
She turned her
 face down the hill to her relatives, and.

---
that she had killed Prince
---
She suddenly stepped up
---
Directly Tess was out of sight, and
---
, poor Tess was n't gone away
---
as she turned to

---
she had got back to the village she was

---
However, in bed that
 night she sighed, and
---
I wish poor"," she said. 
---
" I was thinking."


---
if Tess had not gone
---
Still, if' twere the doing again,
 I would n't let."


---
her go
---
till I had found out
---
Well,
 as one of the genuine stock, she ought
---
en, if
 she plays her trump card aright
---
" What's her trump card? 
---
Rising still, an
 immense landscape stretched around them on every side; behind, the
 green valley of her birth, before, a gray country of which she knew
 nothing except from her first brief visit to Trantridge. 
---
as she naturally was
---
She began to
.


---
, I suppose?
---
" she said with attempted
 unconcern.


---
" Why, Tess" it is n't a
 brave bouncing girl like you who asks that? 
---
she has a very
 queer temper.
---
she looked round at me in a very grim way
 just then. 
---
she nearly killed me. 
---
But she's touchy
 still, very touchy; and
---
It was my fate, I suppose. just after I bought her And
 then, take my word for it, I nearly killed her.  one's life is hardly safe behind her
 sometimes."


---
The wind blew through Tess's white muslin to her very skin, and
---
her
 washed hair flew out behind. 
---
She was, but
---
she clutched d'Urberville's rein- arm.


---
She grasped his waist, and
---
said she, her face on
 fire.


---
She had not considered;. 
---
what she had been doing
---
Recovering
 her reserve, she sat without replying, and
---
No, no!" said Tess. 
---
" Never!" said Tess independently,.


---
as well as she could

---
I'll stop-- on my honour
---
" Let, and, I will!"


---
Tess, surprised beyond measure, slid farther back still on her seat,
.


---
" she cried at length, in desperation,. 
---
her up so prettily by her mother had apparently been to lamentable
 purpose.


---
she panted miserably.


---
when, as if hardly yet aware of her own modesty,
 she dodged aside
---
" Very well," said Tess,"!

---
I'll not move
---
But I-- thought!"


---
" But I do n't want, sir!"
---
she implored, a big
 tear beginning to roll down her face, and the corners of her mouth
 trembling in her attempts not to cry. 
---
" And I would n't ha' come!"


---
if
 I had known
---
she sat still, and
---
than she flushed with
 shame
---
for the act on her part had been unconsciously done
---
" You are mighty sensitive for a cottage girl!"
---
Tess made no reply to this remark, of which, indeed, she did not
 quite comprehend the drift, unheeding the snub she had administered
 by her instinctive rub upon her cheek. 
---
She had
---
With a dim
 sense that he was vexed she looked steadily ahead.


---
till she saw, to her consternation,

---
She sighed."
---
" she said. 
---
Tess was down on the
 other side.


---
She turned back and.


---
Tess had not stepped forward.


---
," she said,
---
" No; I shall walk."

"' Tis five or six miles yet to Trantridge."


---
" I do n't care if' tis dozens. 
---
I'll swear!"


---
into which she had
 scrambled
---
" I do n't like' ee at all! 
---
I hate and! 
---
I'll
 go back to mother
---
, I will!"


---
" Well, I like you all the better
---
Still Tess could not be induced. 
---
She did not
---
She might in truth have safely trusted him now; but
---
she kept on the ground
. 
---
Her resolve, however, had been taken, and
---
How could she face her parents,?


---
to which Tess had been appointed as
 supervisor, purveyor, nurse, surgeon, and friend
---
When Tess had occupied herself about an hour the next morning in

---
She had come
 from the manor- house.


---
," she said;
---
that Tess did not quite understand
---
, she explained,
---
" Blind!" said Tess.


---
she took, under her companion's direction,
---
She had the mobile face frequent in those whose sight
 has decayed by stages,. 
---
Tess walked up to this lady with her
 feathered charges-- one sitting on each arm.


---
" Ah, you are the young woman?"
---
While the old lady had been speaking Tess and the other maid
---
she had felt them over from head to tail,.

---
Her touch enabled her, and. 
---
She handled their
 crops, and
---
that the two girls had brought in
---
her perception of each visitor being seldom at fault
---
as she
 received the bird upon her knees
---
It reminded Tess of a Confirmation, in which Mrs d'Urberville was the
 bishop, the fowls the young people presented, and herself and the
 maid- servant the parson and curate of the parish bringing them up.

---
Tess could whistle like most other country- girls,. 
---
though the
 accomplishment was one which she did not care to profess in genteel
 company
---
However, she blandly admitted.


---
," said
 Elizabeth.


---
she made
 no further reply.


---
Thus the reception of Tess by her fancied kinswoman terminated, and

---
But she was far from being aware
.

---
She gathered. 
---
that no great affection flowed between the blind woman
 and her son
---
But in that, too, she was mistaken. 
---
In spite of the unpleasant initiation of the day before, Tess
 inclined to the freedom and novelty of her new position in the
 morning, now that she was once installed there;
 and
---
she was curious to test her powers in the unexpected direction
 asked of her, so as to ascertain her chance of retaining her post.

---
as she was alone within the walled garden
---
As soon she sat herself
 down on a coop, and. 
---
She found her former ability to have
 degenerated to the production of a hollow rush of wind through the
 lips, and no clear note at all.


---
She remained,. 
---
how she
 could have so grown out of the art which had come by nature,
---
till
 she became aware of a movement among the ivy- boughs which cloaked
 the garden- wall no less then the cottage
---
she
 beheld a form springing from the coping to the plot. 
---
Cousin' Tess(' Cousin' had a
 faint ring of mockery)
---
I have been watching you from over the
 wall--. 
---
" I may be cross, but
---
I did n't swear."


---
I understand those bullies! 
---
My mother
 wants. 
---
As if attending to these curst cocks and hens here were not enough
 work for any girl. 
---
I would flatly refuse,."


---
if I were you
---
" But she wants, and."


---
" Does she? 
---
" said Tess,.


---
" Nonsense; I do n't want. 
---
But the allusion was lost upon Tess.


---
She attempted
---
to look reserved; her face put on a sculptural
 severity. 
---
at last, to get rid of
 him, she did put up her lips;
.


---
that
 she had laughed
---
Tess was quite serious, painfully serious by this time; and
---
she
 tried-- ultimately and unexpectedly.

---
The momentary pleasure of success got the better of her;
---
her eyes
 enlarged, and
---
she involuntarily smiled in his face.


---
, do you think my mother a queer old soul?"


---
; she must be,. 
---
if you treat her live- stock well
---
Her first day's experiences were fairly
 typical of those which followed through many succeeding days. 
---
carefully cultivated in her by playful dialogue,
---
But she was
 more pliable under his hands than a mere companionship.


---
She soon found that whistling to the bullfinches in Mrs

---
when she had
 regained the art,
---
for she had caught from her musical mother
---
when she practised in the garden
---
she
 threw up her mouth,.


---
while Tess was at
 the window where the cages were ranged
---
Once, giving her lesson as usual,
 she thought. 
---
she heard a rustling behind the bed
---
The old lady was
 not present, and turning round the girl. 
---
She searched the curtains every morning after that,
 but. 
---
The levity of some of the younger women in and
 about Trantridge was marked, and. 
---
For a long time Tess did not join in the weekly pilgrimages. 
---
But
 was early here-- Tess at length consented. 
---
Her first experience
 of the journey afforded her more enjoyment than she had expected,
.
---
the hilariousness of the others being quite contagious after her
 monotonous attention to the poultry- farm all the week
---
She went again
 and again. 
---
Being graceful and interesting, standing moreover on the
 momentary threshold of womanhood, her appearance drew down upon her
 some sly regards from loungers in the streets of Chaseborough
---
; hence,
 though sometimes her journey to the town was made independently
---
, she
 always searched for her fellows at nightfall,.


---
Tess's occupations made her late in setting out,. 
---
so that her comrades
 reached the town long before her
---
She did not discover the coincidence of the market with the fair till

---
she had reached the place, by which time it was close upon dusk. 
---
then as usual she began to
.


---
At first she could not find them, and
---
she was informed. 
---
She told him.


---
that she was simply waiting for company homeward
---
as she went on down
 the back lane
---
Approaching the hay- trussers, she could hear the fiddled notes of
 a reel proceeding from some building in the rear; but
---
she could see straight through the house into the garden at the
 back as far as the shades of night would allow; and
---
nobody appearing
 to her knock
---
, she traversed the dwelling and.


---
the sound had attracted her
---
which at
 first Tess thought to be illuminated smoke
---
But on drawing nearer
 she perceived.


---
When she came close and
---
, the demigods resolved
 themselves into the homely personalities of her own next- door
 neighbours. 
---
one of them recognized her.


---
She waited. 
---
, thought Tess. 
---
She became restless and uneasy; yet,
---
though not fearful of measurable dangers, she feared the unknown.

---
Had she been near Marlott
---
she would have had less dread.


---
She did not abhor dancing, but
---
she was not going. 
---
those of the unhappy partner
 of the man; she happened

---
She looked round, and
---
she reluctantly retreated towards him.


---
She was so tired after her long day and her walk that she confided
 her trouble to him-- that she had been waiting ever since he saw her
 to have their company home, because the road at night was strange to
 her. 
---
Tess, though flattered, had never quite got over her original
 mistrust of him, and,
---
despite their tardiness, she preferred. 
---
So she answered. 
---
that she was much obliged
 to him, but
---
Tess soon perceived, sometimes with this
 one, sometimes with that, that the fresh night air was producing
 staggerings and serpentine courses among the men who had partaken too
 freely
---
as she walked in the flock
---
Tess, however, had undergone such painful experiences of this kind in
 her father's house. 
---
that the discovery of their condition spoilt the
 pleasure she was beginning to feel in the moonlight journey
---
This leading pedestrian was Car the Queen of Spades, who carried a
 wicker- basket containing her mother's groceries, her own draperies,
 and other purchases for the week. 
---
Car had placed it for convenience of porterage on the top of her
 head, where it rode on in jeopardized balance as she walked with
 arms akimbo.


---
Her gown was a light cotton print, and
---
from the
 back of her head a kind of rope could be seen.


---
Tis her hair falling down
---
No; it was not her hair
---
: it was a black stream of something oozing
 from her basket, and
---
Honey she had in plenty out of her own hives, but

---
what her soul desired
---
Hastily lowering the basket the dark girl found
.


---
She rushed
 excitedly into the field they were about to cross, and
---
flinging
 herself flat on her back upon the grass, began.


---
she could
---
Our heroine, held her peace,.


---
the soberer richer note of Tess among those of the other
 work- people than a long- smouldering sense of rivalry inflamed her to
 madness
---
She sprang to her feet and.


---
she cried.


---
" I could n't really help it," apologized Tess,
.


---
To Tess's horror the dark queen began.

---
she
 was only too glad to be free of--
---
till she had bared her plump neck,
 shoulders, and arms to the moonshine, under which they looked as
 luminous and beautiful as some Praxitelean creation, in their
 possession of the faultless rotundities of a lusty country- girl
---
She closed her fists and.


---
Several other women also
 chimed in, with an animus which none of them would have been so
 fatuous as to show but for the rollicking evening they had passed.

---
Tess unfairly browbeaten,
---
Tess was indignant and ashamed. 
---
She no longer minded the loneliness
 of the way and the lateness of the hour
---
; her one object was. 
---
She knew well enough
.

---
she was edging back to rush
 off alone, and
---
Tess was standing apart from the rest, near the gate. 
---
She felt almost ready to faint
---
At almost any other moment of her life she would have refused such
 proffered aid and company,; and
---
as she had refused them several times
 before
---
now the loneliness would not of itself have forced her
. 
---
But coming juncture, she
 abandoned herself to her impulse,. 
---
The Queen of Spades forgot the stain on her bodice, and.


---
as she steadied herself on
 the arm of her fond husband
---
as
 she explained laconically:" Out of the frying- pan into the fire
---
She had perceived. 
---
She begged him
.


---
" Yes!" said she. 
---
" I am sure I ought to be much obliged to you."


---
She did not reply.


---
" I suppose--."


---
because I do n't love you
---
" I am angry with you sometimes!"


---
" Ah, I half feared as much." 
---
when I have made you angry
---
Because I can not help myself here.
---
" I have n't offended you often by love- making?"


---
I have tried
---
She was silent, and
---
Whether on this account, or from absent- mindedness, or
 from sleepiness, she did not perceive,
 and
---
that her conductor had not taken the Trantridge track.


---
She was inexpressibly weary. 
---
She had risen at five o'clock
---
; she had then walked
 a mile of the way home, and
---
on
 this evening had in addition walked the three miles to Chaseborough,
 waited three hours for her neighbours without eating or drinking,
 her impatience to start them preventing either had undergone the excitement of the
 quarrel, till, with the slow progress of their steed, it was now
 nearly one o'clock. 
---
Only once, however, was she overcome by actual
 drowsiness. 
---
This immediately put her on the defensive, and
---
to which she was liable
---
with one of those
 sudden impulses of reprisal she gave him a
 little push from her. 
---
She pondered suspiciously, till,"


---
, she relented, and.
---
She drew a quick pettish breath of objection,
---
Tess expressed no further negative. 
---
till it struck her and

---
she exclaimed.


---
said Tess, between archness and
 real dismay, and. 
---
" Just when
 I've been putting such trust in you, and,
! 
---
because I thought
---
I had wronged you by that push
---
if I must tell you, and
---
," she coaxed. 
---
" Put me down, I beg you. 
---
Having brought you
 here to this out- of- the- way place, I feel myself responsible for
 your safe- conduct home, whatever you may yourself feel about it.

---
; for, to tell the truth, dear, owing to this fog,, I do n't quite know. 
---
while I walk through the
 bushes
---
till I come to some road or house, and
---
Now,
 to wait beside the horse ascertain exactly our
 whereabouts, I'll deposit you here willingly. 
---
When I come back
---
I'll
 give you full directions, and;
---
She accepted these terms, and. 
---
" I suppose?
---
I must hold the horse
---
" said she.


---
she exclaimed, with a painful sense
 of the awkwardness of having to thank him just then.


---
she murmured, much

---
"," she reluctantly admitted. 
---
that, beginning with one slow tear, and
 then following with another, she wept outright
---
She passively sat down amid the leaves he had heaped, and

---
She could hear the rustling of the branches,. 
---
Tess became invisible.


---
as she fell into
 reverie upon the leaves where he had left her
---
" Tess!" said d'Urberville.


---
She was sleeping soundly, and
---
where was Tess's guardian
 angel
---
where was the providence of her simple faith? 
---
As Tess's own people down in those retreats are never tired of saying
 among each other in their fatalistic way
---
who stepped from her mother's door
---
she lugged them
 along like a person who did not find her especial burden in material
 things. 
---
Occasionally she stopped by some
 gate or post; and
---
then, giving the baggage another hitch upon her
 full round arm, went steadily on again.


---
The time was not long past daybreak,
 and the yellow luminosity upon the horizon behind her back lighted
 the ridge towards which her face was set-- the barrier of the vale
. 
---
wherein she had of late been a stranger-- which she would have to
 climb over to reach her birthplace
---
so that, though less than twenty miles from the
 place of her sojourn at Trantridge, her native village had seemed a
 far- away spot. 
---
The incline was the same down which d'Urberville had driven her so
 wildly on that day in June. 
---
Tess went up the remainder of its length
 without stopping, and
---
; it was terribly beautiful to Tess
 to- day, for. 
---
since her eyes last fell upon it
---
she had learnt
---
that the
 serpent hisses, and her views of life had
 been totally changed for her by the lesson
---
she had been at home
---
Verily another girl than
 the simple one was she
---
She could not bear

---
that Tess herself had just laboured
 up
---
to look forward into the Vale.

 Ascending by the long white road, she saw a two- wheeled vehicle, beside which walked a man, who
 held up his hand to attract her attention.


---
She obeyed the signal to wait for him with unspeculative repose, and

---
"," said she.


---
" I thought you wouldn't
---
She listlessly placed her basket and bundle within the dog- cart, and

---
She had no fear of him now,
 and
---
in the cause of her confidence her sorrow lay.


---
But she had not, and
---
she sat now, like a puppet,
. 
---
that her still face showed the least
 emotion, a tear or two beginning to trickle down
---
She did not reply.


---
She resumed--


---
what every woman says
---
she cried,. 
---
her eyes flashing as the latent spirit( of which he was to

---
what every woman says

---
that some women may feel
---
Her lip lifted slightly,.


---
though there was little scorn, as a rule,
 in her large and impulsive nature
---
Well, Tess, dear, I
 can say no more. 
---
I suppose I am a bad fellow-- a damn bad fellow.
 I was born bad, and I have lived bad, and I shall die bad in all
 probability.  But, upon my lost soul, I wo n't be bad towards you
 again, Tess.  I may not be at Trantridge-- I am going to London for a time-- I ca n't
 stand the old woman.  But all letters will be forwarded."


---
She said. 
---
that she did not wish, and
---
She bowed to him slightly,
---
then she turned.


---
"," she answered indifferently. 
---
She thereupon turned round and. 
---
Her eyes
 vaguely rested upon the remotest trees in the lane,.


---
as though she were nearly unconscious of what he did
---
She turned her head in the same passive way,.


---
, I fear.
---
She added mournfully,"
---
You can hold your own for
 beauty against any woman of these parts, gentle or
 simple
---
Tess did not look after him, but.

---
Sad October
 and her sadder self seemed the only two existences haunting that
 lane.


---
As she walked
---
before she had been
 long aware of his propinquity
---
she
 permitted him
---
" Yes," said Tess.


---
She also assented to this.


---
Though I do more real work to- day than all the week besides.
---
" All the week I work for the glory of man, and on Sunday for the
 glory of God. 
---
I have a little
 to do here at this stile." 
---
" I shall not be long."


---
she could not well do otherwise; and
---
she waited,
. 
---
But the words entered Tess with accusatory horror. 
---
she
 mechanically resumed her walk beside him.


---
she asked in low tones.


---
Do I believe in my own existence!"


---
" But," said she tremulously,"
---
" I can not split hairs on that burning query
---
," said Tess. 
---
" No," said she; and.
---
Tess trudged on
---
A little way
 forward she turned her head. 
---
Her cheerful friend saw
---
her looking
---
I'm
 not of his persuasion now, but
---
But Tess did not answer
---
; she throbbingly resumed her walk, her eyes
 fixed on the ground. 
---
" Pooh-- I do n't believe!"

---
she murmured contemptuously.


---
when her flush had died away
---
the
 sight of which made her heart ache
---
when
 she reached it
---
The aspect of the interior,, made her heart ache more. 
---
Her mother,, turned. 
---
where she
 was kindling barked- oak twigs under the breakfast kettle
---
I did n't see you! " No, I have not come for that, mother."

" Yes-- for a holiday; for a long holiday," said Tess.


---
Her mother eyed her narrowly.


---
," she said.


---
Then Tess went up to her mother,.


---
Any
 woman would have done it but you, after that!"


---
how I've got, and
---
I did! 
---
How a
 convulsive snatching at social salvation might have impelled her to
. 
---
she could not say
---
But her poor foolish mother little
 knew her present feeling towards this man. 
---
as she had said
---
what made her detest herself
---
She had

---
She
 had dreaded him,,;
---
even for her
 name's sake she scarcely wished
---
as if her poor heart would break
---
How could I be

---
I was a child. 
---
when I left this house four months
 ago
---
I never had the
 chance o' learning in that way, and
---
Her mother was subdued.


---
" I thought
---
if I spoke of his fond feelings and
---
hontish wi' him lose your chance," she murmured,
. 
---
I suppose. 
---
In the afternoon several young girls of
 Marlott, former schoolfellows and acquaintances of Tess, called to
 see her,. 
---
For the fact this said thirty- first cousin,
 Mr d'Urberville, who had fallen in love with her, a gentleman
 not altogether local, whose reputation as a reckless gallant and
 heartbreaker was beginning to spread beyond the immediate boundaries
 of Trantridge,.


---
Their interest was so deep that the younger ones whispered when her
 back was
---
" How pretty she is; and
---
how that best frock do set her off! 
---
Tess, to get the tea- things from the
 corner- cupboard, did not hear these commentaries. 
---
If she had heard
 them
---
, she might soon have set her friends right on the matter. 
---
But
 her mother heard, and
---
Joan's simple vanity, having been denied the
 hope of a dashing marriage it could upon
 the sensation of a dashing flirtation. 
---
Upon the whole she felt
,
---
even though such a limited and evanescent triumph should
 involve her daughter's reputation
---
gratified; it might end in marriage yet, and
 in the warmth of her responsiveness to their admiration she invited
 her visitors to stay to tea.


---
Their chatter, their laughter, their good- humoured innuendoes, above
 all, their flashes and flickerings of envy, revived Tess's spirits
 also; and,
---
, she caught the infection of their
 excitement, and. 
---
The marble hardness left her face,

---
she moved with something of her old bounding step, and.


---
At moments, in spite of thought, she would reply to their inquiries
 with a manner of superiority,. 
---
that her experiences
 in the field of courtship had, indeed, been slightly enviable
---
I
 believe, and."

 But
 so far was she from being, in the words of Robert South," in love
 with her own ruin,"
---
to mock her spasmodic weakness; the ghastliness
 of her momentary pride would convict her, and.


---
she awoke alone in her old bed,. 
---
the innocent younger
 children breathing softly around her
---
In place of the excitement of
 her return, and the interest, she saw before her a
 long and stony highway which she had to tread, without aid, and with
 little sympathy. 
---
Her depression was then terrible, and
---
she could
 have hidden herself in a tomb.


---
In the course of a few weeks Tess revived sufficiently to show
 herself so far as was necessary to get to church one Sunday morning.

---
She liked-- and the old Psalms,
 and to join in the Morning Hymn. 
---
which
 she had inherited from her ballad- singing mother
---
which could well- nigh drag her heart out of
 her bosom at times
---
To be as much out of observation as possible for reasons of her own,
 and to escape the gallantries of the young men, she set out, and.


---
, one of her favourites
 happened-- the old double chant

---
she did not know,. 
---
though she would
 much have liked
---
She thought, without exactly wording the
 thought, how strange and god- like was a composer's power, who from
 the grave could lead through sequences of emotion, which he alone had
 felt at first, a girl like her who had never heard of his name, and

---
at last observing her, they whispered to each
 other. 
---
She knew,.


---
that she could come to church no more
---
which she shared with some of the children
---
The bedroom formed her
 retreat more continually than ever. 
---
Here, under her few square yards
 of thatch, she watched winds, and snows, and rains, gorgeous sunsets,
 and successive moons at their full. 
---
she had gone away
---
that Tess took at this time
---
when out in the woods, that she seemed least solitary
---
She
 knew. 
---
She had no fear of the
 shadows
---
; her sole idea seemed.


---
she moved in
---
Her flexuous and stealthy figure
 became an integral part of the scene. 
---
At times her whimsical fancy
 would intensify natural processes around her. 
---
till they seemed a part
 of her own story
---
A wet
 day was the expression of irremediable grief at her weakness in the
 mind of some vague ethical being whom she could not class definitely
 as the God of her childhood, and could not comprehend as any other.


---
But this encompassment of her own characterization, based on shreds
 of convention, peopled by phantoms and voices antipathetic to her,

---
was a sorry and mistaken creation of Tess's fancy-- a cloud of moral
 hobgoblins by which she was terrified without reason. 
---
, she
 looked upon herself as a figure of Guilt intruding into the haunts
 of Innocence. 
---
all the while she was making a distinction where
 there was no difference. 
---
Feeling herself in antagonism, she was
 quite in accord. 
---
She had been made,
 but no law known to the environment in which she fancied herself such
 an anomaly.




---
But those of the other sex were the most interesting of this company
 of binders, by reason of the charm which is acquired by woman. 
---
when
 she becomes part and parcel of outdoor nature, and
---
; a field- woman is a portion of the field
---
she had

---
The women-- or rather girls, for they were mostly young--
---
This morning the
 eye returns involuntarily to the girl in the pink cotton jacket
---
, she
 being the most flexuous and finely- drawn figure of them all. 
---
But
 her bonnet is pulled so far over her brow. 
---
that none of her face is

---
while she binds
---
though her complexion may be guessed from
 a stray twine or two of dark brown hair which extends below the
 curtain of her bonnet
---
why she seduces casual
 attention
---
that she never courts it, though the other women often
 gaze around them
---
she draws a handful of ears,
---
Then, stooping low, she moves forward,
. 
---
She
 brings the ends of the bond together, and kneels on the sheaf while
 she ties it, beating back her skirts now and then when lifted by the
 breeze. 
---
A bit of her naked arm is visible between the buff leather
 of the gauntlet and the sleeve of her gown; and
---
At intervals she stands up, and. 
---
Then one can see the oval
 face of a handsome young woman with deep dark eyes and long heavy
 clinging tresses, which seem to clasp in a beseeching way anything
 they fall against. 
---
The cheeks are paler, the teeth more regular,
 the red lips thinner than is usual in a country- bred girl.


---
, otherwise d'Urberville, somewhat changed-- the
 same, but not the same; at the present stage of her existence living
 as a stranger and an alien here, that
 she was in. 
---
After a long seclusion she had come to a resolve to

---
that
 she could do within the house
---
The movements of the other women were more or less similar to Tess's,

---
, every one placing her sheaf on
 end against those of the rest, till a shock, or" stitch"
---
As the hour of eleven drew near a person watching her might

---
that every now and then Tess's glance flitted wistfully
 to the brow of the hill,
---
though she did not pause in her sheafing
---
The face of Tess flushed slightly, but
---
still she did not pause.


---
She sat down at the end of the shock
---
, her face turned somewhat away
 from her companions. 
---
When she had deposited herself a man in a
 rabbit- skin cap, and with a red handkerchief tucked into his belt
---
for her to drink
---
But
 she did not accept his offer. 
---
as her lunch was spread
---
As soon she
 called up the big girl, her sister, and. 
---
Tess, with a curiously
 stealthy yet courageous movement, and with a still rising colour,
 unfastened her frock and.


---
All the women but Tess fell into animated
 talk, and.


---
, the young mother sat it upright
 in her lap, and,
---
looking into the far distance dandled it with a
 gloomy indifference; then all of a sudden she
 fell.


---
as if she could
 never leave off
---
" She's fond of that there child,,
 and.


---
she wishes
---
" She'll soon leave off."
---
that
 it should have happened to she
---
; it was impossible; rather all those shades together, and a hundred
 others, which could be seen if one looked into their irises-- shade
 behind shade-- tint beyond tint-- around pupils that had no bottom; an
 almost standard woman, but for the slight incautiousness of character
 inherited from her race.


---
for even an enemy
 to feel otherwise on looking at Tess as she sat there, with her
 flower- like mouth and large tender eyes, neither black nor blue nor
 grey nor violet
---
which had surprised herself
---
A resolution had brought her into the
 fields this week for the first time during many months. 
---
After
 wearing and wasting her palpitating heart with every engine of regret
, common sense had illuminated
 her. 
---
She felt. 
---
that she would do well
---
she herself grassed down and.

---
The familiar surroundings had
 not darkened because of her grief, nor.


---
She might have seen-- the
 thought of the world's concern at her situation--
---
that what had bowed her head so profoundly
---
She was not an existence, an experience, a passion, a
 structure of sensations, to anybody but herself. 
---
To all humankind
 besides, Tess was only a passing thought. 
---
Even to friends she was
 no more than a frequently passing thought. 
---
If she made herself
 miserable the livelong night and day
---
, she makes herself unhappy." 
---
If she tried
---
to be cheerful,
 to dismiss all care, to take pleasure in the daylight, the flowers,
 the baby, she could only be this idea to them--"Ah
---
, she bears it
 very well." 
---
Moreover, alone in a desert island would she have been
 wretched at what had happened to her? 
---
If she could
 have been but just created, to discover herself as a spouseless
 mother, with no experience of life except as the parent of a nameless
 child
---
, would the position have caused her to despair? 
---
No, she would
 have taken it calmly, and.
---
Most of the misery
 had been generated by her conventional aspect, and not by her innate
 sensations.


---
Whatever Tess's reasoning, some spirit had induced her, and. 
---
as she had formerly done
---
why she had borne herself with dignity, and
---
Tess, having quickly eaten her own meal,.


---
Tess staying on till dusk with the body of harvesters.

---
Tess's female companions sang songs, and
. 
---
though they could not refrain from mischievously throwing
 in a few verses of the ballad about the maid who went to the merry
 green wood and came back a changed state
---
which had made of her a
 social warning
---
Their friendliness won her still
 farther away from herself
---
she became almost gay.


---
that her moral sorrows were passing away a fresh one arose on
 the natural side of her which knew no social law
---
When she reached
 home
---
The baby's offence against society in coming into the world was
 forgotten by the girl- mother
---
; her soul's desire was. 
---
However, it soon grew
 clear that the hour of emancipation for that little prisoner of the
 flesh was to arrive earlier than her worst misgiving.

---
when she had discovered this
---
And she was plunged into a misery which
 transcended that of the child's simple loss. 
---
Her baby had not been
 baptized.


---
Tess had drifted into a frame of mind which accepted passively the
 consideration that if she should have to burn for what she had done,
 burn she must, and
---
Like all village girls,
 she was well grounded in the Holy Scriptures, and. 
---
Her darling was about
 to die, and no salvation.


---
she rushed downstairs and. 
---
if she
 might send for the parson
---
which Tess had set upon that
 nobility
---
when, by her shame, it
 had become more necessary than ever to hide them
---
distressed beyond measure, Tess
 retired also
---
She was continually waking, and
---
as she lay
---
In her misery she rocked herself upon the bed. 
---
She thought of

---
to which picture she added many
 other quaint and curious details of torment
---
The lurid presentment so powerfully
 affected her imagination in the silence of the sleeping house
---
that
 her nightgown became damp with perspiration, and
---
the bedstead shook
 with each throb of her heart.


---
the mother's mental
 tension increased. 
---
to devour the little thing with
 kisses; she could stay in bed no longer, and.


---
" she cried.

---
till she suddenly started up
---
She spoke so brightly that it seemed as though her face might have
 shone in the gloom surrounding her. 
---
She lit a candle, and. 
---
where she awoke her young
 sisters and brothers
---
so that she could get behind it
---
, she poured
 some water from a jug, and. 
---
While the children,
 scarcely awake, awe- stricken at her manner, their eyes growing larger
 and larger
---
, remained in this position, she took the baby from her
 bed-- a child's child-- so immature as scarce. 
---
Tess then
 stood erect with the infant on her arm beside the basin
---
; the next
 sister held the Prayer- Book open before her,
---
thus the girl set about baptizing her
 child.


---
Her figure looked singularly tall and imposing. 
---
as she stood in her
 long white nightgown, a thick cable of twisted dark hair hanging
 straight down her back to her waist
---
which sunlight might have revealed-- the stubble scratches upon her
 wrists, and the weariness of her eyes-- her high enthusiasm having
 a transfiguring effect upon the face which had been her undoing,
 showing it as a thing of immaculate beauty, with a touch of dignity
 which was almost regal
---
The little ones kneeling round,, awaited her preparations full of a suspended
 wonder which their physical heaviness at that hour would not allow to
.


---
The girl- mother replied in a grave affirmative.


---
She had not thought of that, but
---
the book of Genesis came into her head,
---
as she proceeded with the
 baptismal service
---
now she pronounced it:

"."


---
SORROW, I baptize thee in the name of the Father, and of the Son,
 and of the Holy Ghost
---
She sprinkled the water, and
---
Tess went on:

"."


---
Here she dipped her hand into the basin, and. 
---
She duly went on with the Lord's Prayer, the
 children lisping it after her in a thin gnat- like wail, till, at the
 conclusion, raising their voices to clerk's pitch"


---
Then their sister, with much augmented confidence in the efficacy
 of the sacrament, poured forth from the bottom of her heart the
 thanksgiving that follows, and
---
which her voice acquired
---
when her heart was in
 her speech
---
which will never be forgotten by those who knew her.

---
The ecstasy of faith almost apotheosized her
---
; it set upon her face a
 glowing irradiation, and
---
while the miniature candle- flame inverted in her eye- pupils

---
The children gazed up at her with more and
 more reverence, and
---
She did
 not look like Sissy to them now, but as a being large, towering, and
 awful-- a divine personage with whom they had nothing in common.


---
which had possessed Tess
---
since the christening remained
 with her in the infant's loss
---
In the daylight, indeed, she felt her
 terrors about his soul
---
to have been somewhat exaggerated; whether
 well founded or not, she had no uneasiness now,.


---
that
 she, for one, did not value the kind of heaven lost by the
 irregularity-- either for herself or for her child
---
Tess,, wondered.

---
She went to his house after dusk,
 and. 
---
if she had not by accident met

---
as she turned away
---
" I should like."


---
she told the story of the
 baby's illness and the extemporized ordinance. 
---
" And now, sir," she
 added earnestly,"
---
" My dear girl" it will be just the same."


---
she asked quickly.


---
She seized his hand.


---
as she spoke
---
she burst out," and
---
So the baby was carried in a small deal box, under an ancient woman's
 shawl, to the churchyard that night, and. 
---
In spite of the
 untoward surroundings, however, Tess bravely made a little cross of
 two laths and a piece of string, and
---
,
 she stuck it up at the head of the grave one evening. 
---
when she could
 enter the churchyard without being seen,
---
At last
 she had learned; but
---
If before going to the d'Urbervilles' she had vigorously moved under
 the guidance of sundry gnomic texts and phrases known to her and to
 the world in general
---
, no doubt she would never have been imposed on.

---
But it had not been in Tess's power-- nor. 
---
She-- and how many more-- might have ironically said
 to God with Saint Augustine:"."


---
She remained at her father's house during the winter months,, and
---
she had put by with contempt. 
---
she would not.

---
But she would often clasp her hands behind her head and muse.


---
when she
 was supposed
---
She philosophically noted dates; the disastrous night of her undoing at Trantridge with
 its dark background of The Chase; also the dates of the baby's birth
 and death; also her own birthday; and every other day individualized
 by incidents in which she had taken some share. 
---
She suddenly thought

---
one afternoon, when looking in the glass at her fairness, that there
 was yet another date, of greater importance to her than those;
---
that
 of her own death, when all these charms would have disappeared; a day
 which lay sly and unseen among all the other days of the year, giving
 no sign or sound when she annually passed over it; but not the less
 surely there. 
---
Why did she not feel the chill of each
 yearly encounter with such a cold relation? 
---
She had. 
---
who had known her
---
that day, doomed to be her terminus in time through all the ages, she
 did not know the place in month, week, season or year.


---
Tess thus changed from simple girl to complex woman
---
Symbols of reflectiveness passed into her face, and a note of tragedy
 at times into her voice. 
---
Her eyes grew larger and more eloquent.

---
She became
---
; her aspect
 was fair and arresting; her soul that of a woman whom the turbulent
 experiences of the last year or two had quite failed to demoralize.

---
She had held so aloof of late that her trouble, never generally
 known, was nearly forgotten in Marlott. 
---
But it became evident to her
. 
---
that she could never be really comfortable again in a place which
 had seen the collapse of her family's attempt to" claim kin"-- and,
 through her, even closer union-- with the rich d'Urbervilles
---
At
 least she could not be comfortable there till long years. 
---
Yet even now Tess felt the
 pulse of hopeful life still warm within her
---
; she might be happy in
 some nook which had no memories. 
---
that she would
 have
---
she would ask
 herself. 
---
She might prove it false. 
---
if she could veil bygones
---
She waited a long time without finding opportunity for a new
 departure. 
---
; it moved her,, and. 
---
At last, one day in
 early May, a letter reached her from a former friend of her mother's,
 to whom she had addressed inquiries long before-- a person whom she
 had never seen-- that a skilful milkmaid was required at a dairy- house
 many miles to the southward, and that the dairyman would be glad to
.


---
her radius of movement and repute having been
 so small. 
---
On one point she was resolved
---
: there should be no more d'Urberville
 air- castles in the dreams and deeds of her new life. 
---
She would be

---
Her mother knew Tess's feeling
 on this point
---
so well,, that she never alluded to the knightly ancestry now.


---
Yet such is human inconsistency that one of the interests of the
 new place to her was the accidental virtues of its lying near her
 forefathers' country. 
---
though her
 mother was Blakemore to the bone
---
for which she was bound
---
The dairy called Talbothays,
, stood not remotely from some of the former
 estates of the d'Urbervilles, near the great family vaults of her
 granddames and their powerful husbands. 
---
She would be able to look at
 them, and. 
---
All the while she wondered. 
---
if any strange good thing
 might come of her being in her ancestral land; and
---
some spirit within
 her rose  automatically as the sap in the twigs
---
she left her home for the second time.


---
so that it could be sent to her later
---
Having packed up her luggage,
 she started in a hired trap for the little town of Stourcastle,
. 
---
On the
 curve of the nearest hill she looked back regretfully at Marlott and
 her father's house,.


---
although she had been so anxious to get away
---
Her kindred dwelling there would probably continue their daily
 lives as heretofore, with no great diminution of pleasure in their
 consciousness,, and
---
although she would be far off
---
they deprived of
 her smile. 
---
In a few days the children would engage in their games as
 merrily as ever, without the sense of any gap left by her departure.

---
she had decided
---
This leaving of the younger children to be for the
 best; were she.


---
they would probably gain less good by her
 precepts than harm by her example
---
She went through Stourcastle without pausing and onward to a junction
 of highways, where she could await a carrier's van that ran to the
 south- west; for the railways which engirdled this interior tract of
 country. 
---
she wished
---
she accepted his offer of a seat beside him,. 
---
that
 its motive was a mere tribute to her countenance
---
Tess did not stop at Weatherbury, after this long drive,. 
---
to which the
 farmer recommended her
---
she started on foot, basket in hand,

---
that was
 the aim and end of her day's pilgrimage
---
Tess had never before visited this part of the country, and
---
yet she
 felt akin to the landscape. 
---
she
 could discern a dark patch in the scenery, which inquiry confirmed
 her in supposing to be trees marking the environs of Kingsbere-- in
 the church of which parish the bones of her ancestors-- her useless
 ancestors-- lay entombed.


---
She had no admiration for them now
---
; she almost hated them for the
 dance they had led her
---
; she retain but the old seal and spoon. 
---
" Pooh-- I have as much of
 mother as father in me!"
---
she said. 
---
" All my prettiness comes from
 her, and
---
she was only a dairymaid."


---
when she reached them
---
The journey over the intervening uplands and lowlands of Egdon,
, was a more troublesome walk than she had
 anticipated,. 
---
she found herself
 on a summit commanding the long- sought- for vale, the Valley of the
 Great Dairies, the valley in which milk and butter grew to rankness,
 and were produced more profusely, if less delicately, than at her
 home-- the verdant plain so well watered by the river Var or Froom.


---
It was intrinsically different from the Vale of Little Dairies,
 Blackmoor Vale, which, save during her disastrous sojourn at
 Trantridge
---
, she had exclusively known till now. 
---
These myriads
 of cows stretching under her eyes from the far east to the far west
 outnumbered any she had ever seen at one glance before.
---
The ripe hue of the red and dun kine
 absorbed the evening sunlight, which the white- coated animals
 returned to the eye in rays almost dazzling, even at the distant
 elevation on which she stood.


---
before her was not so luxuriantly
 beautiful, perhaps, as that other one which she knew so well; yet it
 was more cheering. 
---
where there were no invidious eyes
 upon her
---
Either the change in the quality of the air from heavy to light, or
 the sense of being amid new scenes, sent up her spirits wonderfully. 
---
Her hopes mingled with
 the sunshine in an ideal photosphere. 
---
which surrounded her
---
as she
 bounded along against the soft south wind
---
She heard a pleasant
 voice in every breeze, and
---
Her face had
---
One day she was pink and flawless;
 another pale and tragical. 
---
When she was pink
---
she was feeling less
 than when pale
---
; her more perfect beauty accorded with her less
 elevated mood; her more intense mood with her less perfect beauty.

---
It was her best face physically.


---
The irresistible, universal, automatic tendency to find sweet
 pleasure somewhere,, had at length mastered Tess. 
---
Being even now only a young
 woman of twenty, one growing, it was impossible.


---
that any event should have left upon her
 an impression that was not in time capable of transmutation
---
She tried several ballads, but
---
that her eyes had so often
 wandered over of a Sunday morning
---
before she had eaten of the tree
 of knowledge
---
till, recollecting the psalter, she chanted:" O ye Sun and Moon...
---
She suddenly stopped and."


---
But perhaps I do n't quite know
 the Lord as yet
---
women retain in their souls far
 more of the Pagan fantasy of their remote forefathers than of the
 systematized religion
---
However, Tess
 found at least approximate expression for her feelings in the old
_
---
that she had lisped from infancy
---
Tess really wished,
; but
---
she resembled him in
, and in having no
 mind for laborious effort towards such petty social advancement as
 could alone be effected by a family so heavily handicapped as the
 once powerful d'Urbervilles were now.


---
the energy of her mother's unexpended
 family, as well as the natural energy of Tess's years, rekindled

---
after the experience so overwhelmed her for the time
---
women do as a rule live through such humiliations,
 and
---
When Tess had accomplished this
 feat
---
she found.


---
herself to be standing on a carpeted level, which
 stretched to the east and west as far as the eye could reach
---
Not quite sure of her direction, Tess stood still upon the hemmed
 expanse of verdant flatness, like a fly on a billiard- table of
 indefinite length, and of no more consequence to the surroundings
 than that fly. 
---
The sole effect of her presence upon the placid
 valley so far had been.


---
which,
 after descending to the ground not far from her path, stood with neck

---
It was
 not the expression of the valley's consciousness that beautiful Tess
 had arrived, but the ordinary announcement of milking- time-- half- past
 four o'clock, when the dairymen set about getting in the cows.


---
Tess followed slowly in their rear, and. 
---
through which they had entered before her
---
Between the post were ranged
 the milchers, each exhibiting herself at the present moment to a
 whimsical eye in the rear as a circle on two stalks, down the centre
 of which a switch moved pendulum- wise;. 
---
as each animal lingered for her turn.




---
Each girl sat down on
 her three- legged stool, her face sideways, her right cheek resting
 against the cow, and looked musingly along the animal's flank at Tess
 as she approached. 
---
The male milkers, with resting flat on their foreheads and gazing on the ground, did not
 observe her.


---
Seeing Tess standing at gaze
---
till apprised of the fact by a brief business- letter about Tess)
---
And a aged
 woman of ninety to live nigh here, but is dead and gone long
 ago, told me. 
---
," said Tess.


---
I do n't want."


---
She reassured him on that point, and
---
She had been staying indoors a good deal, and
---
her complexion had

---
She declared.


---
that she could stand it, and
---
her zest and willingness
 seemed
---
" Well, I suppose,
 hey? 
---
I'll begin,
---
" milking now to get my hand in," said Tess.


---
She drank a little milk as temporary refreshment-- to the
 surprise-- indeed, slight contempt-- of Dairyman Crick, to whose mind
 it had apparently never occurred that milk was good as a beverage.


---
that she sipped from
---
You can try your hand upon she
---
what she do milk rather hard. 
---
When Tess had changed her bonnet for a hood, and
---
the milk was squirting from her fists
 into the pail
---
was really on her
 stool under the cow, and, she appeared. 
---
that she really had laid a new
 foundation for her future
---
The conviction bred serenity, her pulse
 and
---
she was able to look about her.


---
After Tess had settled down to her cow
---
there was for a time no talk
 in the barton, and not a sound interfered with the purr of the
 milk- jets into the numerous pails, except a momentary exclamation
 to one or other of the beasts requesting her to turn round or stand
 still.
---
Upon my life, keeping back like this, she'll not be worth going under by
 midsummer.
---
Tess,, thought, but
---
she was wrong. 
---
; it had
 been spoken by a milker behind the animal, whom she had not hitherto
 perceived.


---
Tess's attention was thus attracted to the dairyman's interlocutor,
 of whom she could see but the merest patch,. 
---
She could not
 understand. 
---
though she made my
 fingers ache
---
Tess could then see him at full length. 
---
Tess passed through since that time; and
---
that for a
 moment she could not remember
---
where she had met him
---
then it
 flashed upon her
---
she knew

---
brought back by this revival of an incident
 anterior to her troubles
---
when she found no sign of remembrance in him
---
She
 saw by degrees. 
---
" I think I have finished her, however,."

 Meanwhile many of the milkmaids had said to one another of the
 newcomer,"!" with something of real generosity and
 admiration, though with a half hope that the auditors would qualify
 the assertion-- which, strictly speaking, they might have done,
 prettiness being an inexact definition of what struck the eye in
 Tess. 
---
How pretty she is
---
who was too
 respectable to go out milking herself
---
slept in the dairy- house
 besides herself, most of the helpers going to their homes. 
---
She saw
 nothing at supper- time of the superior milker who had commented on
 the story, and.

---
the remainder of the
 evening being occupied in arranging her place in the bed- chamber
---
They were blooming young women, and, except one, rather
 older than herself. 
---
But one of the girls,, was more wakeful
 than Tess, and. 
---
into which she had just entered
---
The
 girl's whispered words mingled with the shades, and, to Tess's drowsy
 mind
---
Tess had not at this hour the curiosity to ask gradually fell
 asleep again, the words of her informant coming to her along with the
 smell of the cheeses in the adjoining cheeseloft, and the measured
 dripping of the whey from the wrings downstairs.




---
whose first wife had died and
---
while
 she refuses
---
" What is the good of your mother and me economizing and stinting
 ourselves,?"
---
that she was present at table
---
She talked so
 little, and
---
She was not looking towards him. 
---
"," she was saying;" but
---
" A very easy way to feel," continued Tess," is; and, by
 fixing your mind upon it
---
The general attention being drawn to her,
---
, Tess flushed, and,.


---
She soon finished her eating, and
.


---
The maids' private aims, however, were the
 reverse of the dairyman's rule, the daily selection by each damsel of
 the eight or ten cows to which she had grown accustomed rendering the
 operation on their willing udders surprisingly easy and effortless.


---
Tess, like her compeers, soon discovered, and
---
which of the cows had a
 preference for her style of manipulation
---
her fingers having

---
to which
 she had subjected herself at intervals during the last two or three
 years
---
become delicate from the long domiciliary imprisonments, she would have been glad to meet the milchers' views in
 this respect. 
---
Out of the whole ninety- five there were eight in
 particular-- Dumpling, Fancy, Lofty, Mist, Old Pretty, Young Pretty,
 Tidy, and Loud-- who, though the teats of one or two were as hard as
 carrots, gave down to her with a readiness that made her work on them
 a mere touch of the fingers. 
---
Knowing, however, the dairyman's wish,
 she endeavoured conscientiously,.


---
But she soon found a curious correspondence between the ostensibly
 chance position of the cows and her wishes in this matter,. 
---
till she
 felt
---
at the fifth or sixth time she turned her eyes,.


---
as she
 rested against the cow, full of sly inquiry upon him
---
" she said,.


---
, symptoms of a smile gently lifted her upper
 lip in spite of her,
---
She was angry with herself afterwards,. 
---
She had spoken so earnestly to him,. 
---
Her misgiving was.


---
such that at
 dusk,, she walked in the garden alone, to

---
that she had disclosed to him her discovery of
 his considerateness
---
The soundlessness impressed her as
 a positive entity rather than as the mere negation of noise. 
---
Tess had heard those notes in the attic above her head. 
---
, they had never appealed
 to her as now,. 
---
as she listened

---
Tess, like a fascinated bird, could not leave the spot. 
---
Far from
 leaving she drew up towards the performer,.


---
in which Tess found
---
herself had been

---
She went stealthily as a cat through this profusion of
 growth,
---
thus she drew quite near to Clare, still unobserved of him.


---
Tess was conscious of neither time nor space. 
---
which
 she had described as being producible at will by gazing at a star

---
; she undulated upon the
 thin notes of the second- hand harp, and their harmonies passed like
 breezes through her, bringing tears into her eyes. 
---
she waited,. 
---
Tess, her cheeks on fire, moved away furtively,.


---
a young girl like you to see
 it so just yet
---
She maintained a hesitating silence.


---
She thought shyly--


---
She was
 expressing in her own native phrases--. 
---
assisted a little by her Sixth
 Standard training-- feelings which might almost have been called those
 of the age-- the ache of modernism
---
that they should have come to her while yet so
 young;
---
Tess's
 passing corporeal blight had been her mental harvest.


---
Tess, on her part, could not understand. 
---
For the unhappy pilgrim herself there was very
 good reason. 
---
as she herself had felt two or three years ago--"My soul chooseth
 strangling and death rather than my life
---
But she knew

---
At times,
 nevertheless, it did seem unaccountable to her.


---
Tess was trying, but
---
she little divined the strength of her own
 vitality.


---
As such she compared him with herself; and at every
 discovery of the abundance of his illuminations, of the distance
 between her own modest mental standpoint and the unmeasurable, Andean
 altitude of his
---
, she became quite dejected, disheartened from all
 further effort on her own part whatever.


---
I loathe it She was
 gathering the buds called" lords and ladies" from the bank.


---
," she said, with a frail laugh of
 sadness,
---
When I see
---
I feel
---
what a nothing I am
---
I'm
 like the poor Queen of Sheba who lived in the Bible. 
---
she had

---
learning," she answered, with a slight quaver in her voice.

---
She went on

---
as they dropped with her bent gaze on
 her soft cheek
---
she stood
 awhile,; and
---
then, awakening
 from her reverie, flung it and all the crowd of floral nobility
 impatiently on the ground, in an ebullition of displeasure with
 herself for her
---
In an access of hunger for his good
 opinion she bethought herself of what she had latterly endeavoured to

---
forget, so unpleasant had been its issues-- the identity of her family
 with that of the knightly d'Urbervilles. 
---
as its discovery had been in many ways to her, perhaps

---
that those Purbeck- marble and alabaster people in
 Kingsbere Church really represented her own lineal forefathers
---
; that
 she was no spurious d'Urberville, compounded of money and ambition
 like those at Trantridge, but true d'Urberville to the bone.


---
But, before venturing to make the revelation, dubious Tess indirectly
 sounded the dairyman as to its possible effect upon Mr Clare, by
 asking the former if Mr Clare had any great respect for old county
 families when they had lost all their money and land.


---
After hearing this caricature of Clare's opinion poor Tess was glad

---
that she had not said a word in a weak moment about her family--
---
Besides, another diary- girl was as good as

---
She held her tongue about the
 d'Urberville vault and the Knight of the Conqueror whose name she
 bore. 
---
Tess and Clare unconsciously studied
. 
---
Tess had never in her recent life been so happy as she was now,
. 
---
She was, for one thing,
. 
---
Moreover she, and
 Clare also, stood as yet on the debatable land between predilection
 and love; where no profundities have been reached
---
Tess was the merest stray phenomenon to Angel Clare as yet-- a rosy,
 warming apparition which had only just acquired the attribute of
 persistence in his consciousness. 
---
as Tess was the latest arrival
---
that she could be depended upon not to sleep

---
though the alarm, this task was thrust most frequently
 upon her
---
than she left her room and
---
that Tess was dressed
---
Tess seemed to Clare
---
as she was likely to

---
that at that preternatural
 time hardly any woman so well endowed in person be walking in the open air within the boundaries of his horizon
---
Fair women are usually asleep at mid- summer
 dawns. 
---
She was close at hand, and
---
She
 looked ghostly,. 
---
as if she were merely a soul at large
---
that she impressed him most deeply
---
She was no longer the milkmaid, but a visionary essence of woman-- a
 whole sex condensed into one typical form. 
---
" Call me Tess," she would say askance; and
---
her features would become simply
 feminine
---
which trail they found her the snoring puff from her nostrils, when
 she recognized them, making an intenser little fog of her own amid
 the prevailing one
---
Minute
 diamonds of moisture from the mist hung, too, upon Tess's eyelashes,
 and. 
---
commonplace these dried off her
---
; moreover, Tess then
 lost her strange and ethereal beauty;
---
her teeth, lips, and eyes
 scintillated in the sunbeams and
---
she was again the dazzlingly fair
.


---
since I went to Conjuror Trendle's son in Egdon
---
," she said tentatively.

---
" I've heard in my younger days. 
---
I can mind all about
---
" Jack Dollop, a' hore's- bird of a fellow, courted a young woman over at Mellstock, and. 
---
woman to
 reckon wi' this time, and
---
it was not the girl herself. 
---
when we zid the girl's mother
, wi' a great brass- mounted umbrella in her
 hand that would ha' felled an ox, and
---
because I want him
---
I have a big bone to pick with he,
---
I
 can assure' n!' 
---
And some way behind her mother walked Jack's young
 woman,. 
---
' She'll murder me!

---
just as the young woman's mother busted into
 the milk- house
---
Where shall I get--?  where I be The villain--?' says she. 
---
Well, she hunted about
 everywhere,. 
---
' I'll claw
 his face for'n, I shall never
 forget it, never!' But she
 could n't find him nowhere at all."


---
" Well, how the old woman should have had the wit, but
---
she found out.

---
she took hold of the winch
---
round she swung him, and
---
I could
 never tell' I shall be churned into a pummy!'  Not till ye make amends
 for ravaging her virgin innocence!' says the old woman. 
---
says she,'!' 
---
Well, none of us ventured; and at
 last' a promised to make it right wi' her. 
---
Tess,
 pale- faced, had gone to the door.


---
" she said, almost inaudibly.


---
none of them connected her withdrawal with the
 reminiscences of the dairyman. 
---
I was faint-- and
---
-- I think
---
I am better out o' doors
---
"," she said
 mechanically; and.


---
the attention of all was called
 off from Tess.


---
That fair sufferer soon recovered herself externally; but
---
she
 remained much depressed all the afternoon.
---
she did not care, and. 
---
she knew not whither
---
She was wretched-- O
 so wretched-- at the perception that to her companions the dairyman's
 story had been rather a humorous narration than otherwise
---
how cruelly it touched the tender place in her experience
---
The evening sun was now ugly to her, like a great inflamed wound in
 the sky. 
---
Only a solitary cracked- voice reed- sparrow greeted her from
 the bushes by the river, in a sad, machine- made tone,.


---
whose friendship she had outworn
---
Tess
 usually accompanied her fellows upstairs. 
---
To- night, however, she was
 the first to go to their common chamber; and
---
she had dozed. 
---
when the
 other girls came in
---
She saw
---
; she
 dozed again, but
---
she was reawakened by their voices, and
---
Neither of her three chamber- companions had got into bed. 
---
," said Retty, the
 auburn- haired and youngest girl, without removing her eyes from the
 window.


---
"' Tis no use any more than me, Retty
 Priddle," said jolly- faced Marian, the eldest, slily. 
---
Retty Priddle still looked, and
---
cried Izz Huett, the pale girl with dark damp
 hair and.


---
" For I zid you
."


---
her doing
---
She put her mouth against the wall and

---
kissed the shade of his mouth; I zid her,."


---
" O Izz Huett!" said Marian.


---
A rosy spot came into the middle of Izz Huett's cheek.


---
," she declared, with attempted
 coolness. 
---
if I be in love wi'en
---
Marian's full face could not blush past its chronic pinkness.


---
she said. 
---
," said Marian, with the dry frankness of
 complete indifference to opinion. 
---
I would
 just marry' n to- morrow!"


---
" So would I-- and more," murmured Izz Huett.


---
" And I too," whispered the more timid Retty.


---
," said Izz
---
"," said Marian,. 
---
" I have watched him every day, and."


---
" But she do n't care anything for' n?
---
" Well-- I sometimes think that too."


---
said Izz Huett impatiently. 
---
Marian's plump figure sighed
 biggest of all. 
---
Tears came into
 the eyes of Retty Priddle, the pretty red- haired youngest-- the last
 bud of the Paridelles, so important in the county annals. 
---
Marian was soon snoring, but
---
Izz did not drop into forgetfulness for
 a long time. 
---
Retty Priddle cried herself to sleep.


---
The deeper- passioned Tess was very far from sleeping even then. 
---
This
 conversation was another of the bitter pills she had been obliged to
 swallow that day. 
---
the least feeling of jealousy arose in her
 breast. 
---
For that matter she knew herself.

---
though the youngest
 except Retty, more woman than either, she perceived
---
ought she
---
she had heard from Mrs Crick. 
---
A farm- woman would be the
 only sensible kind of wife for him. 
---
But, why should she, who could never conscientiously
 allow?




---
that she never would be tempted
---
, Tess tasted,
 also the other indoor milkmaids, one or two of the milking- men, and
 last of all Mrs Crick, who came out from the waiting breakfast- table
---
" Very well, thank you, sir," she replied demurely.


---
" And you, maidy Tess, you
 was n't well a day or two ago
---
Tess dropped behind. 
---
When
 she found him near her
---
what she had heard the
 night
---
" she said.


---
Tess had moodily decided.


---
that either of these maidens would make a
 good farmer's wife, and
---
that she ought, and obscure
 her own wretched charms
---
Well, yes-- they are pretty girls
---
I have

---
She is colouring up
---
"," continued Tess heroically.


---
" Because you are looking at her."


---
as her mood might be
---
Self- sacrificing, Tess could not well go further
 and!" 
---
She followed Dairyman
 Crick, and.


---
From this day she forced herself--. 
---
She gave the other three
 every chance.


---
Tess was woman enough to realize from their avowals to herself that
 Angel Clare had the honour of all the dairymaids in his keeping, and
 her perception of his care to avoid compromising the happiness of
 either in the least degree bred a tender respect in Tess for what she
 deemed, rightly or wrongly, the self- controlling sense of duty shown
 by him, a quality which she had never expected to find in one of the
 opposite sex, and in the absence of which more than one of the simple
 hearts who were his house- mates might have gone weeping on her
 pilgrimage.




---
Tess and the other three were dressing themselves
 rapidly,. 
---
She had now been two months at Talbothays, and
---
this
 was her first excursion.


---
when the girls
 reached the most depressed spot they found that the result of the
 rain had been to flood the lane over- shoe to a distance of some fifty
 yards. 
---
said Marian, from the top of the roadside bank on which they had
 climbed, and were maintaining a precarious footing in the hope of
 creeping along its slope till they were past the pool.


---
said Retty,.


---
" And I do colour up so hot,, and all the
 people staring round
---
walking into church late," said Marian,"."


---
that I hardly cool down again

---
No-- I wish!"
---
murmured Tess.

 Angel, in fact, rightly or wrongly preferred sermons in stones to sermons in
 churches and chapels on fine summer days. 
---
Angel's eye at last fell
 upon Tess, the hindmost of the four; she, being full of suppressed
 laughter at their dilemma, could not help.


---
Marian had lowered herself upon his arm and shoulder, and

---
Izz Huett was the next in order upon
 the bank.


---
"," she murmured, and
---
that her lips were
 dry with emotion
---
," said Tess quickly.


---
" Yes," said Izz,"."


---
I've always a' ear at church for pretty verses
---
She quietly and
 dreamily lowered herself into his arms, and
---
returning for the third time
 Retty's throbbing heart could be almost seen. 
---
Her comprehension appeared in her face
---
; she could not
 help it. 
---
Marian had been like a sack of meal,
 a dead weight of plumpness under which he has literally staggered.

---
Izz had ridden sensibly and calmly. 
---
Retty was a bunch of hysterics.


---
Tess could see over the hedge the distant three in a
 group,. 
---
It
 was now her turn. 
---
She was embarrassed to discover that excitement at
 the proximity of Mr Clare's breath and eyes, which she had contemned
 in her companions,; and
---
as if fearful of
 betraying her secret, she paltered with him at the last moment.


---
" I may be able to clim' along the bank perhaps--
---
I can clim' better
 than they. 
---
" No, no, Tess," said he quickly. 
---
almost before she was aware
---
And,
 she was seated in his arms and.


---
" They are better women than I.


---
," she replied,
---
her grow warm at this
---
she said timidly.


---
You should lift Marian! 
---
if I seem like that to you
---
that I have undergone three- quarters of this labour
 entirely for the sake of the fourth quarter
---
" I did not expect such an event to- day."


---
what she understood
---
The girl's cheeks burned to the breeze, and
---
she could not look into
 his eyes for her emotion. 
---
Her friends were looking with round thoughtful eyes at her and him,
 and
---
she could see. 
---
that they had been talking of her
---
till Marian broke the silence
 by saying--


---
" No-- in all truth; we have no chance against her!" 
---
She looked
 joylessly at Tess.


---
" No, no," said she.


---
they did not blame her. 
---
Tess's heart ached. 
---
There is
 contagion in this sentiment, especially among women. 
---
" I will never stand in your way, nor in the way of either of you!"

---
she declared to Retty that night in the bedroom( her tears running
 down). 
---
" I ca n't help this, my dear! 
---
I do n't think; but
---
to ask me I should refuse him,
."


---
as I should refuse any man
---
But I will be plain. 
---
Putting myself quite on one
 side, I do n't think."


---
I have never expected it
---
I
 wish!"


---
I was dead
---
torn by a feeling which she hardly understood
---
The poor child,, turned
 to the other two girls who came upstairs just then.


---
" We be friends with her again
---
," she said to them. 
---
" She thinks no
 more of his choosing her than we do."


---
" I do n't seem
---
what I do now
---
to care," said Marian, whose mood was
 turned to its lowest bass. 
---
" I was going; but
---
" To confess, then," murmured Izz,
---
Each one was a girl of fair common sense,
 and
---
she did not delude herself with any vain conceits, or.

---
It was Izz Huett's voice.


---
Tess replied in the affirmative, whereupon also"


---
Retty and Marian
 suddenly flung the bedclothes off them, and sighed--

" So be we!
---
" I wonder-- the lady they say his family have looked
 out for him!"


---
what she is like
---
I wonder
---
"," said Izz.

"?"
---
" I have never
 heard o' that!"


---
After this disclosure Tess nourished no further foolish thought that
 there lurked any grave and deliberate import in Clare's attentions
 to her. 
---
It was a passing summer love of her face, for love's own
 temporary sake-- nothing more.
---
And the thorny crown of this sad
 conception was that she whom he really did prefer in a cursory way
 to the rest, she who knew herself to be more impassioned in nature,
 cleverer, more beautiful than they,.




---
On one of these afternoons four or five unmilked cows chanced to
 stand apart from the general herd, behind the corner of a hedge,
 among them being Dumpling and Old Pretty, who loved Tess's hands
 above those of any other maid. 
---
When she rose from her stool under a
 finished cow, Angel Clare, who had been observing her for some time
---
if she would take the aforesaid creatures next
---
She
 silently assented, and with her stool at arm's length, and
---
the pail
 against her knee, went round to where they stood. 
---
She was milking Old Pretty thus, and the sun chancing to be on the
 milking- side upon her profile,.


---
, it shone flat upon her pink- gowned form and her white
 curtain- bonnet, and
---
She did not know, and
---
The stillness of her head and features
 was remarkable
---
: she might have been in a trance, her eyes open, yet
 unseeing. 
---
And
 it was in her mouth. 
---
that little upward lift in the middle of her red
 top lip was distracting,
---
She then became conscious that he was observing her; but
---
she would
 not show it by any change of position,.


---
that
 the rosiness of her face deepened,
---
Tess was taken completely by surprise, and
---
she yielded to his embrace
 with unreflecting inevitableness. 
---
that it was really her
 lover who had advanced,
---
Having seen and no one else, her lips parted, and
---
she
 sank upon him in her momentary joy, with something very like an
 ecstatic cry.


---
" I ought.

---
I-- did not know. 
---
what I was doing
---
I do not mean it as a liberty.

---
I am devoted to you, Tessy, dearest, in all sincerity!"


---
Old Pretty by this time had looked round, puzzled; and seeing two
 people crouching under her where, by immemorial custom, there should
 have been only one,.


---
She is angry
---
"-- she does n't know
---
She slipped up from her seat, and
---
Tess's eyes, fixed on distance, began.


---
she murmured.


---
As she saw and.


---
she was in
---
she became
 agitated and tried to withdraw
---
her to free herself
---
She seemed almost alarmed, at what had occurred,
. 
---
A personality within
 it was in her influence. 
---
Tess was no insignificant creature to toy with and
 dismiss; but a woman living her precious life-- a life which, to
 herself who endured or enjoyed it, possessed as great a dimension
 as the life of the mightiest to himself. 
---
Upon her sensations
 the whole world depended to Tess
---
; through her existence all her
 fellow- creatures existed, to her. 
---
The universe itself only came into
 being for Tess on the particular day in the particular year in which
 she was born.


---
This consciousness was the single
 opportunity of existence ever vouchsafed to Tess by an unsympathetic
 First Cause-- her all
---
To encounter her daily in the accustomed manner would be. 
---
Would not a farmer want a
 wife, and
---
should a farmer's wife be a drawing- room wax- figure, or a
 woman who understood farming? 
---
some
 maid observed.


---
that she had not seen anything of Mr Clare that day
---
But neither girl by word or gesture revealed her blankness. 
---
" asked Izz Huett, the only
 one of the gloom- stricken bevy who could trust her voice with the
 question.


---
; Retty, with parted lips, gazing on the tablecloth, Marian
 with heat added to her redness,.


---
Tess throbbing and
---
" Well, I ca n't mind the exact day without looking at my
 memorandum- book
---
That would depend upon whether the germs of staunch
 comradeship underlay the temporary emotion, or whether it were a
 sensuous joy in her form only, with no substratum of everlastingness.


---
she did not
---
that she was
---
An overpowering
 reluctance to greet her made.

---
that she had not seen him
---
She was great at Antinomianism and
 Bible- classes, and. 
---
His mother appeared in a cap and
 silver spectacles, and
---
She is a kind, jolly sort of body, and is sure to ask me
 directly I return.
---
they went out of the
 room with their mother, and
---
What kind of wife do you think
---
But ought she not primarily
---
that my neighbour
 Chant's daughter had lately caught up the fashion of the younger
 clergy round about us for decorating the Communion- table-- altar, as I
 was shocked to hear her call it one day-- with flowers and other stuff
 on festival occasions
---
But, father, do n't you
 think that a young woman equally pure and virtuous as Miss Chant,
 but one who, in place of that lady's ecclesiastical accomplishments,
 understands the duties of farm life as well as a farmer himself?"


---
that a knowledge of a farmer's
 wife's duties came second to a Pauline view of humanity
---
whether or not she had attached herself to the sound Low Church
 School of his father
---
she would probably be open to conviction
 on that point
---
; she was a regular church- goer of simple faith;
 honest- hearted, receptive, intelligent, graceful to a degree, chaste
 as a vestal, and, in personal appearance, exceptionally beautiful.


---
" Is she of a family?
---
" She is not
---
for she is a cottager's daughter,
---
But she IS a lady, nevertheless-- in feeling and nature.
---
She'll be apt pupil enough,.
---
if you knew
 her
---
She's brim full of poetry-- actualized poetry,. 
---
She LIVES...

And she is an
 unimpeachable Christian
---
as she really does attend Church almost
 every Sunday morning, and
---
practised by her and the other
 milkmaids
---
that
 she at least was sound in her views;
---
finally that it was better, but that they would
 not object to see her
---
Her unsophisticated open- air
 existence required no varnish of conventionality. 
---
His mother made him sandwiches, and
---
whether she were well provided or penniless
---
She had not heard, and.

---
She was yawning, and
---
She had stretched one arm so high above her
 coiled- up cable of hair
---
; her face was flushed with sleep, and
---
her eyelids hung
 heavy over their pupils. 
---
The brim- fulness of her nature breathed
 from her. 
---
when a woman's soul is more incarnate than
 at any other time
---
before the remainder of her face was well awake
---
the full sense of
 the matter rose up in her face.


---
when she encountered Clare's tender
 look as he stepped forward to the bottom stair
---
Having
 been lying down in her clothes she was warm as a sunned cat. 
---
At
 first she would not look straight up at him, but
---
her eyes soon
 lifted, and
---
while she regarded him as Eve at her second waking
---
to go a- skimming," she pleaded," and
---
Tess with the skimming; and,, I am sure
---
Tess was in a dream wherein familiar objects appeared
 as having light and shade and position, but no particular outline.

---
she held the skimmer under the pump,
---
her hand trembled
---
you be that woman, Tessy?"


---
She turned quite careworn. 
---
She had bowed to the inevitable result of
 proximity, the necessity of loving him; but
---
she had not calculated
 upon this sudden corollary, which, indeed, Clare had put before her
 without quite meaning himself to do it so soon. 
---
she murmured the words of her
 indispensable and sworn answer as an honourable woman.


---
The sound of her own decision seemed, and

---
she bowed her face in her grief.


---
" Tess holding her at arm's length" you are engaged to
!"


---
She will want.
---
" she echoed.


---
She again took up the shining skimmer,. 
---
But she could not, as at other times, hit the exact
 under- surface of the cream with the delicate dexterity required,
---
as she might
---
try
; sometimes she was cutting down into the milk, sometimes
 in the air. 
---
She could hardly see,
---
her eyes having filled with two
 blurring tears drawn forth by a grief which, to this her best friend
 and dear advocate
---
, she could never explain.


---
" she said,.


---
" I do n't know."


---
whom she heard

---
Tess's ideas on the views of the parish clergyman, every week, seemed.


---
" I wish,
---
I could fix my mind on what I hear there more firmly than I
 do
---
" she remarked as a safe generality. 
---
She spoke so unaffectedly that Angel was sure in his heart that his
 father could not object to her on religious grounds, even though she
 did not know whether her principles were High, Low or Broad. 
---
which she held
---
; she grew, and
---
the
 undulations disappeared from her skimming;.


---
as she finished one lead
 after another
---
I fancied
---
"," she
 ventured, anxious to keep away from the subject of
 herself.


---
who has a mother afflicted with blindness
---
, I
 must say,
---
I wish
---
Tess's look had grown hard and worn, and her ripe mouth tragical; but

---
she no longer showed any tremulousness. 
---
As
 Tess withdrew
---
She went out towards the mead,. 
---
the open air drive away her sad
 constraint
---
All the girls drew onward to the spot where the cows
 were grazing in the farther mead, the bevy advancing with the bold
 grace of wild animals-- the reckless, unchastened motion of women
 accustomed to unlimited space-- in which they abandoned themselves to
 the air as a swimmer to the wave. 
---
That she had already permitted him to

---
make love to her not fully
 trowing that in the fields and pastures to" sigh gratis" is by no
 means deemed waste; love- making being here more often accepted
 inconsiderately and for its own sweet sake than in the carking,
 anxious homes of the ambitious, where a girl's craving for an
 establishment paralyzes her healthy thought of a passion as an end.


---
She started.


---
" Yes-- something like that," murmured she. 
---
She could only shake her head and.


---
she said, with continued self- suppression.


---
" I almost know. 
---
" I do n't repulse you. 
---
I like you
---
I do n't like--
---
because I am SURE I ought not to do it
---
that she was
---
After these tender
 contests and her victory she would go away by herself under the
 remotest cow, if at milking- time, or into the sedge or into her room,
 if at a leisure interval, and mourn silently, not a minute after an
 apparently phlegmatic negative.


---
that she tried
---
She had come to Talbothays with a made- up mind. 
---
On no account could
 she agree to a step which might afterwards cause bitter rueing to her
 husband for his blindness in wedding her. 
---
And she held.


---
what her
 conscience had decided for her
---
when her mind was unbiassed
---
she said. 
---
She guessed from the sad
 countenances of her chamber companions; but
---
that they regarded her not
 only as the favourite, but as the chosen
---
that she did not put herself in his way
---
Tess had never before known a time in which the thread of her life
 was so distinctly twisted of two strands, positive pleasure and
 positive pain. 
---
Her sleeves were rolled far above
 the elbow, and
---
Although the early September weather was sultry, her arm, from
 her dabbling in the curds
---
But she was such
 a sheaf of susceptibilities
---
that her pulse was accelerated by the
 touch, her blood driven to her finder- ends, and the cool arms
 flushed hot. 
---
as though her heart had said
---
," she lifted her eyes and
---
as her
 lip rose in a tender half- smile
---
She looked a sudden fear that her resistance might break down under
 her own desire.


---
the remark had cut her
---
The stress now getting beyond endurance, her lip quivered, and
---
she
 was obliged. 
---
she exclaimed. 
---
At last she got away, and. 
---
till she was in

---
where
 she could be quite unseen
---
Here Tess flung herself down upon the
 rustling undergrowth of spear- grass, as upon a bed, and.


---
broken by momentary shoots of joy,
 which her fears about the ending could not altogether suppress
---
In reality, she was drifting into acquiescence. 
---
Every see- saw of her
 breath, every wave of her blood, every pulse singing in her ears, was
 a voice that joined with nature in revolt against her scrupulousness.

---
in almost a terror of ecstasy
 Tess divined.


---
that, despite her many months of lonely self- chastisement,
 wrestlings, communings, schemes to lead a future of austere
 isolation, love's counsel would prevail
---
still she remained among the willows.

---
" I have never said I do n't like the idea, and I never could say it;
!"

 She heard the rattle of taking down the pails from the forked stands;
 the" waow- waow!" which accompanied the getting together of the cows.

---
But she did not go to the milking. 
---
They would see her agitation;
 and
---
Her lover must have guessed her overwrought state, and. 
---
She went in and
 upstairs without a light.


---
for they did not force any remarks upon her in
 the bedchamber
---
she jealously panted, with her hot face to
 the pillow that night, on hearing one of the other girls sigh his
 name in her sleep. 
---
because
 she knew already
---
afterwards been so roughly used by the young woman's mother in the
 butter- churn
---
" As I say,' tis
 a widow- woman, and she had money, it seems-- fifty poun' a year or so;
 and
---
and then she told him. 
---
that by marrying she had lost her fifty poun'
 a year
---
But onluckily the poor woman gets the worst
 o't.
---
She wanted a home, and. 
---
" She ought
---
Yes, she ought
---
"," agreed Izz
---
.

" She must have seen, and.


---
she ought
---
" I think---- I do n't know," replied Tess, the bread- and- butter
 choking her.


---
if I'd have done either o't
---
just as she did
---
I'd
 ha Any woman could do it."


---
The laughter was supplemented only by a
 sorry smile, for form's sake, from Tess. 
---
was
 tragedy to her; and
---
she could hardly bear their mirth. 
---
She soon rose
 from table, and, with an impression that Clare would soon follow her
---
till she stood by the main
 stream of the Var
---
masses of them were floating past her--.


---
, whereon she might almost have ridden; long locks
 of which weed had lodged against the piles driven to keep the cows
 from crossing
---
This question of a woman telling her
 story-- the heaviest of crosses to herself-- seemed but amusement to
 others. 
---
" Tessy!" came from behind her, and
---
" she repeated.


---
( The
 younger dairymaids, including Tess, breakfasted with their hair loose
 on Sunday mornings before building it up extra high for attending
 church, a style they could not adopt when milking with their heads
 against the cows.) 
---
If she had said"
---
Their
 condition of domiciliary comradeship put her, as the woman, to such
 disadvantage by its enforced intercourse,. 
---
had she been better able to avoid him
---
What had given her strength
---
she could see in his eye.


---
The fitful evasiveness of
 her manner countenanced the
 idea. 
---
Tess knew. 
---
that she must break down
---
She loved him so
 passionately, and
---
though Tess kept
---
A proof of her weakness lay
 in the very utterance of what calm strength would not have taken the
 trouble to formulate. 
---
she coveted the
 recantation she feared.


---
She had run up in her bedgown to his door
---
"" she pouted. 
---
She looked a little like what he said she was as,
---
, she tried.


---
" Very well, then,' Angel dearest',," she murmured,, a roguish curl coming upon her mouth, notwithstanding
 her suspense.


---
as Tess stood there in her prettily tucked- up
 milking gown
---
somehow,, her hair carelessly heaped upon her head
---
She passed downstairs very quickly,. 
---
Retty and
 the rest went out. 
---
" Not so very different," she said.


---
There are very few women's lives that are not-- tremulous
---
"," Tess
 replied,. 
---
as if it impressed her
---
," she began,
---
There were signs that it was an exquisite relief to her to hear the
 impatient exclamation,. 
---
though she had resolved so intrepidly
---
generosity make one bid against herself
---
she
 had not the power to attempt self- immolation a second time then.

---
But Tess knew.


---
Tess had come out with
 her milking- hood only, naked- armed and jacketless; certainly not
 dressed for a drive. 
---
She therefore replied by glancing over her
 scant habiliments; but
---
She assented by
, and

---
But that spectacle did not affect her preoccupation. 
---
her
 hair,, caused to
 tumble down from its fastenings and stray beyond the curtain of her
 calico bonnet, was made clammy by the moisture,.


---
" I ought
---
not to have come, I suppose,.


---
" she murmured,
---
" I am sorry for the rain
---
She imperceptibly crept closer, and
---
Tess held it from slipping off him as well as
 herself,
---
" I do," she replied.


---
""

" I'll try."


---
" Yes," said Tess.


---
Tess getting a little
 shelter from a neighbouring holly tree.


---
No
 object could have looked more foreign to the gleaming cranks and
 wheels than this unsophisticated girl, with the round bare arms, the
 rainy face and hair, the suspended attitude of a friendly leopard at
 pause, the print gown of no date or fashion, and the cotton bonnet
 drooping on her brow.


---
She mounted again beside her lover, with a mute obedience
 characteristic of impassioned natures at times, and
---
Tess was so receptive
---
she asked. 
---
" Yes-- I suppose. 
---
, I am sure,
---
I
 have something to tell you--"

" But
---
before I came here
---
If I have a
 very large farm, either English or colonial
---
, you will be invaluable
 as a wife to me; better than a woman out of the largest mansion in
 the country. 
---
I want
---
Yes,
 I was born at so and so
---
I was born at Marlott
---
"," she said,. 
---
" And I grew up there.
---
And I was in the
 Sixth Standard, and
---
when I left school
---
" Yes," she answered faintly.


---
" Well-- why should I love you less after knowing this?"


---
" I was told by the dairyman."


---
I do hate the aristocratic
 principle of blood before everything, and. 
---
But
 I am extremely interested in this news
---
I have thought it sad-- especially since coming here, and
. 
---
I see
---
But other hills and field belonged to Retty's
 people, and perhaps others to Marian's, so that I do n't value it
 particularly.
---
I sometimes wonder; but
---
I wonder. 
---
that I did not see the resemblance of
 your name to d'Urberville, and
---
She had not told. 
---
At the last moment her courage had failed her
---
;
 she feared his blame for not telling him sooner; and
---
her instinct
 of self- preservation was stronger than her candour.


---
" Of course," continued the unwitting Clare," I should have been glad
. 
---
But I am corrupted away from that by my affection for you,

---
For your
 own sake I rejoice in your descent. 
---
this fact of your extraction may make an appreciable difference
 to its acceptance of you as my wife,. 
---
after I have made you the
 well- read woman
---
I mean
---
My mother too, poor soul,
 will think so much better of you on account of it. 
---
" I like the other way rather best."


---
Up in the neighbourhood of The Chase, I think. 
---
" Angel, I think! 
---
I would rather not take the name
---
She was agitated.


---
" Now then, Mistress Teresa d'Urberville, I have you. 
---
If it is SURE to make you happy to have me as your wife, and
---
VERY, VERY much--"

" I do, dearest, of course
---
I mean
---
I ought
---
I will
---
I know
---
She had no sooner said it violent. 
---
than she burst into a dry hard sobbing, so

---
Tess was not a hysterical girl
 by any means, and
---
I ca n't tell--
---
I mean
---
"-- I cry! 
---
because I have broken down in my vow
---
she cried, in a
 distraction of tenderness. 
---
She clasped his neck, and for the first time Clare learnt what an
 impassioned woman's kisses were like upon the lips of one whom she
 loved with all her heart and soul, as Tess loved him.


---
" she asked,.


---
I never really doubted-- never, never!"


---
She had consented. 
---
She might as well have agreed at first.

---
" I must write to my mother
---
," she said. 
---
You are a child to me, Tess, not to know
 how very proper it is to write to your mother at such a time, and
---
Where does she live?"


---
" Ah, then I HAVE seen you before this summer--
---
O, I hope!"




---
XXXI


 Tess wrote a most touching and urgent letter to her mother the very
 next day, and
---
But with respect to your question,
    Tess, J say between ourselves, quite private but very
    strong,. 
---
Many a woman-- some of the Highest in the
    Land-- have had a Trouble in their time; and why should
    you Trumpet yours when others do n't Trumpet theirs? 
---
No
    girl would be such a Fool,. 
---
Dear Tess, keep up your Spirits, and
---
She was recognizing. 
---
Her mother did not
 see life. 
---
as Tess saw it
---
That haunting episode of bygone days was
 to her mother but a passing accident. 
---
But perhaps her mother was
 right as to the course to be followed,. 
---
whatever she might be in her
 reasons
---
Silence seemed, on the face of it, best for her adored
 one's happiness: silence it should be.


---
Thus steadied by a command from the only person in the world who had
 any shadow of right to control her action
---
, Tess grew calmer. 
---
her heart was lighter than it had
 been for weeks. 
---
which followed her
 assent,
---
The days of declining autumn beginning with the month of October, formed a season through
 which she lived in spiritual altitudes more nearly approaching
 ecstasy than any other period of her life.


---
She thought every line
 in the contour of his person the perfection of masculine beauty, his
 soul the soul of a saint, his intellect that of a seer. 
---
; she seemed. 
---
as she saw it
---
She dismissed the past-- trod upon it and.


---
She had not known. 
---
she swerved to excess of honour for Clare
---
; in her honest faith
 she did not disguise her desire to be with him. 
---
The sum of her
 instincts on this matter, if clearly stated, would have been.


---
that the
 elusive quality of her sex might be
 distasteful
---
The country custom of unreserved comradeship out of doors during
 betrothal was the only custom she knew, and
---
to her it had no
 strangeness;. 
---
how normal a thing she, in common with all the other dairy- folk,
 regarded it
---
she said
 gladly.


---
I
 am reserving it for a grand effect, and. 
---
She could answer no more than a bare affirmative,
---
Her feelings almost filled her ears
 like a babble of waves, and. 
---
She put her hand
 in his, and
---
Some of the
 dairy- people,, heard her impulsive speeches, ecstasized to
 fragments,;

---
as she walked leaning on his arm
---
upon which her soul
 seemed
---
she
 loves
---
They marked the buoyancy of her tread, like the skim of a
 bird which has not quite alighted.


---
;
 it enveloped her as a photosphere,.
---
She knew, but
---
she had long spells of power to keep them
 in hungry subjection there.


---
She walked in brightness, but
---
she knew. 
---
One evening Tess and Clare were obliged,
. 
---
she looked thoughtfully up at him, and.


---
" I am not worthy of you
---
-- no, I am not!"
---
she burst out,.


---
that" I wo n't have,
---
Distinction does not
 consist in the facile use of a contemptible set of conventions, but
 in being numbered among those who are true, and honest, and just, and
 pure, and lovely, and of good report-- as you are, my Tess."


---
She struggled with the sob in her throat. 
---
How often had that string
 of excellences made her young heart ache in church of late years, and

---
when I-- was sixteen
---
she said,.


---
what a creature of moods she was, and
---
when she depended for her happiness entirely on
 him
---
" Ah-- why did n't I stay!"
---
she diverged
---
It was no mature woman with a long dark vista of intrigue behind her
 who was tormented thus, but a girl of simple life, not yet one- and
 twenty, who had been caught during her days of immaturity like a bird
 in a springe. 
---
To calm herself the more completely, she rose from her
 little stool and.


---
as she went
---
When she came back
---
she
 was herself again.


---
you are just a wee bit capricious, fitful, Tess
---
," she murmured. 
---
She suddenly
 approached him, and. 
---
that she was not
---
, she placed herself close to him in the
 settle, and. 
---
she continued humbly.


---
," she timidly answered,"
---
Though I ca n't bear
---
I want.
---
" No," she said,:"."


---
I have so many things to think of
 first
---
Tess sprang like an elastic ball from his side to her feet,.


---
her eyes shone in the firelight
---
" I knew!"
---
if I sat so close to him
---
she cried, with
 vexation. 
---
where she was a sitting to
---
as if I was almost" Well-- if so be you had n't told us, I am sure we should n't ha'
 noticed that ye had been sitting anywhere at all in this light,"
 if
 she had n't told me-- not I."


---
She's too good for a
 dairymaid
---
Somehow Tess disappeared. 
---
She had been even more struck with the
 look of the girls who followed Crick than abashed by Crick's blunt
 praise.


---
when she reached her bedroom
---
each damsel was sitting up whitely in her bed,
.


---
But she saw in a few moments.

---
" How her face do show it!"


---
" Yes," said Tess.


---
" YES-- going to MARRY him-- a gentleman!" repeated Izz Huett.


---
And by a sort of fascination the three girls, one after another,
 crept out of their beds, and.

---
Retty put her hands upon Tess's shoulders,.


---
all looking into her face
---
than I can think of
---
Almost more!" said Izz Huett.


---
Marian kissed Tess. 
---
" Yes," she murmured.


---
as she withdrew her lips
---
" Was that because of love for her, or?"
---
continued Izz drily to Marian
---
.

" I was n't thinking o
---
I was on'y feeling
 all the strangeness o't--
---
" that she is, and nobody else.

---
I do n't say nay to it, nor either of us,
---
" said Tess in a low voice.


---
They hung about her in their white nightgowns before replying,.


---
their answer might lie in her look
---
I do n't know
---
-- I do n't know
---
"," murmured Retty Priddle. 
---
" I want to
 hate' ee; but"


---
I can not!
---
how I feel
---
" echoed Izz and Marian. 
---
" I ca n't hate her.

---
Somehow she hinders me!"


---
said the girls in a low, slow whisper. 
---
she contradicted impetuously. 
---
she burst into a hysterical fit of tears,
 yes, yes!"


---
Having once given way she could not stop her weeping.


---
she cried. 
---
" I think
---
I ought to

---
I do n't know

---
what I'm saying! 
---
They went up to her and, but
---
still her sobs tore
 her.


---
" Get some water," said Marian, 
---
She's upset by us,
---
They gently led her back to the side of her bed, where they kissed
 her warmly.


---
"," said Marian. 
---
, I'm sure!"


---
Yes, I am
---
"," she said;" and
---
I am ashamed at so breaking down."


---
how she resolved, with a
 bursting heart,
---
her mother regard her as a fool,.




---
This penitential mood kept her from naming the wedding- day.
---
But Tess's desire seemed.


---
Batches of the animals were sent away
 daily to this lying- in hospital, where they lived on straw till their
 calves were born, after which event, and as soon as the calf could
 walk, mother and offspring were driven back to the dairy. 
---
"," said Tess;" holding
 public- meetings in their market- places, arguing, preaching,
 quarrelling, sobbing, groaning, praying, and cursing.
---
O, I am not
! 
---
And I have tried
---
at her having been caught
---
She was seeing it then. 
---
She hated the thought,
 and
---
she hated more the thought of going home.


---
if you were not the most uncalculating girl in the world
---
" she cried, with a sudden fervour of faith
 in him. 
---
The dairyman, though
 he had thought of dismissing her soon,. 
---
Mrs Crick congratulated Tess on the shilly- shallying having at last
 and
---
that directly she set eyes on Tess she

---
that she was
---
come to an end, said divined to be the chosen one of somebody; Tess had looked so superior;
---
as she walked across
 the barton on that afternoon of her arrival
---
that she was of a good
 family she could have sworn. 
---
In point of fact Mrs Crick did remember
 thinking that Tess was graceful and good- looking as she approached;
 but
---
Tess was now carried along upon the wings of the hours, without the
 sense of a will. 
---
Her naturally bright intelligence had begun; and
---
she accordingly drifted into that passive
 responsiveness to all things her lover suggested, characteristic of
 the frame of mind.


---
But she wrote anew to her mother,
---
It was a gentleman
 who had chosen her, which perhaps her mother had not sufficiently
 considered. 
---
she once asked timidly.

---
" To tell the truth, my Tess, I do n't like."


---
that she had caught his manner and habits, his
 speech and phrases, his likings and his aversions
---
And to leave her
 in farmland would be. 
---
her slip back again out of accord with
 him
---
She found him determined to spend a short time at the Wellbridge
 flour- mills.
---
that I have heard of
---
His wife, she said to herself. 
---
One Sunday morning Izz Huett returned from church, and.


---
," she answered,

---
Tess felt her cheek paling
---
; Izz was right
---
How could she remind her lover?

---
She was suddenly fired with impatience and
 alarm.


---
lest she should lose her dear prize
---
A natural incident relieved her anxiety. 
---
Izz mentioned the omission
 of the banns to Mrs Crick, and
---
I mean.
---
" No, I have not forgot' em
---
I have decided on a licence without consulting you.

---
" I did n't wish
---
to hear it, dearest," she said proudly.


---
But to know was an immense relief to Tess
 notwithstanding,. 
---
How events
 were favouring her!


---
I do n't quite feel easy
---
"," she said to herself. 
---
I wish!"


---
I could have had common banns
---
She wondered, or
---
if she ought to

---
disclosed by the arrival of some large packages addressed to her
---
Inside them she found a whole stock of clothing, from bonnet to
 shoes, including a perfect morning costume, such as would well suit
 the simple wedding they planned. 
---
her upstairs undoing them
---
A minute later she came down with a flush on her face and tears in
 her eyes.


---
she murmured, her cheek upon his
 shoulder. 
---
She did return upstairs, and. 
---
Alone, she stood for a
 moment; and

---
before the glass looking at the effect of her silk attire
---
then there came into her head her mother's ballad of the mystic
 robe--


     .

---
That never would become that wife
        That had once done amiss,


 which Mrs Durbeyfield had used to sing to her as a child, so blithely
 and so archly, her foot on the cradle, which she rocked to the tune
---
this robe should betray her by changing colour,
---
as her robe
 had betrayed Queen Guinevere
---
Since she had been at the dairy
---
she
 had not once thought of the lines till now.




---
Tess paid the
 penalty of walking about with happiness superadded to beauty on her
 countenance by being much stared at as she moved amid them on his
 arm.


---
Tess waited in the entry. 
---
shut
 each time for the passage of these, the light within the parlour fell
 full upon Tess's face. 
---
passed by her among the
 rest
---
One of them had stared her up and down in surprise, and
---
she
 fancied,.


---
she was
 another woman, forty miles from here
---
Tess asked in a
 dry dull voice. 
---
" I mean?"


---
What she meant
---
which she obediently did as well as she
 could
---
But she was grave, very grave, all the way home;."


---
till she
 thought,"
---
Tess sat up lest
. 
---
While she
 sat. 
---
she heard a noise in Angel's room overhead, a sound of thumping
 and struggling
---
This was the last drachm required to turn the scale of her
 indecision. 
---
she could not;

---
She sat down and. 
---
Then,
, she crept upstairs without any
 shoes and.


---
Her night was a broken one,, and
---
she listened for
 the first faint noise overhead. 
---
She descended. 
---
, she thought. 
---
she felt. 
---
that she could
 say nothing
---
that her doubts were childish
---
just as she
 was, and
---
She glanced into his room, and. 
---
she had a sudden enthusiastic trust that he surely
 would forgive her.


---
having through the whole of
 this last week of their sojourn at the dairy been accorded something
 of the position of guests, Tess being honoured with a room of her
 own. 
---
Tess's friends lived so far off
---
Her perception rendered Tess guiltily doubtful
. 
---
She rose from breakfast. 
---
It had occurred to her. 
---
she stood at the open
 door of the apartment,
---
She stooped to the
 threshold of the doorway, where she had pushed in the note two or
 three days earlier in such excitement. 
---
under the edge of the carpet she discerned the faint
 white margin of the envelope containing her letter to him, which he
 obviously had never seen, owing to her having in her haste.


---
With a feeling of faintness she withdrew the letter.
---
just as it had left her hands
---
She could not let,
---
she destroyed the letter there.


---
She was so pale.

---
she had jumped at
---
she knew in her conscience not
---
Tess could
 get
---
I could think o' as a noiseless thing" I am so anxious to talk to you-- I want!" she said with attempted lightness.


---
, I hope,. 
---
I will confess mine at
 the same time.
---
I think,
---
I, too, will tell you my
 faults then. 
---
" I do not, Tessy, really."


---
She was whirled onward through the next couple of critical hours by
 the mastering tide of her devotion to him, which closed up further
 meditation. 
---
herself his,
 to call him her lord, her own
---
In
 dressing, she moved about in a mental cloud of many- coloured
 idealities, which eclipsed all sinister contingencies by its
 brightness.


---
Upheld by the momentum of the time, Tess knew nothing of this,. 
---
She knew
---
She was a sort of celestial person, who owed
.


---
her being to poetry-- one of those classical divinities Clare was
 accustomed to talk to her about when they took their walks together
---
; had there been a thousand they would have produced
 no more effect upon her. 
---
They were at stellar distances from her
 present world. 
---
with which she swore her
 faith to him
---
At a pause in the service,, she
 unconsciously inclined herself towards him,
---
; she had been frightened by a passing thought, and
.


---
that she loved him--
---
every curve of her form showed that--
 but
---
she could feel the vibrant
 air humming round them from the louvred belfry in the circle of
 sound, and
---
it matched the highly- charged mental atmosphere in which
 she was living.


---
wherein she felt glorified by an irradiation
 not her own, like the angel whom St John saw in the sun
---
Her eyes could dwell upon details
 more clearly now, and
---
to be sent for them, to leave the carriage to the young couple, she
 observed the build and character of that conveyance for the first
 time. 
---
Sitting in silence she regarded it long.


---
I fancy, Tessy
---
" Yes," she answered,. 
---
" I tremble at
 many things. 
---
I seem

---
-- I must have seen it in a dream."


---
I have never heard of it to my knowledge
---
"," said she. 
---
-- may I know it?"


---
" Well-- I would rather not tell it in detail just now. 
---
But I'll tell you
 another day
---
" I do n't remember,
---
hearing it before" she murmured. 
---
By the time she was contrite and spiritless. 
---
She
 was Mrs Angel Clare, indeed, but
---
had she any moral right to the name?

---
Was she not more truly Mrs Alexander d'Urberville? 
---
She knew not;
 and
---
what was expected of women in such cases
---
she had no counsellor.


---
when she found herself alone in her room for a few
 minutes
---
on which she was ever
---
However,-- the last day this to enter it-- she
 knelt down and. 
---
She tried, but
---
She was
 conscious of the notion expressed by Friar Laurence
---
" O my love, why do I love you so!"
---
she whispered there alone
---
;" for
 she is not my real self, but one in my image; the one I
 might have been!"


---
Tess saw her three chamber- mates
 in a row against the wall, pensively inclining their heads. 
---
She
 had much questioned; but

---
She knew; and
---
why the
 delicate Retty looked so fragile, and Izz so tragically sorrowful,
 and Marian so blank
---
she forgot her own dogging shadow for a
 moment in contemplating theirs.


---
She impulsively whispered to him--


---
When they reached the door Tess femininely glanced back to discern
 the effect of that kiss of charity
---
; there was no triumph in her
 glance,. 
---
when she saw
---
said Tess to her husband. 
---
I'll twist your neck!
---
," said she;"!"




---
she answered with a smile. 
---
, these
 paintings represent women of middle age, of a date some two hundred
 years ago, whose lineaments once seen can never be forgotten.

---
" I have been told by old folk that they were ladies of the
 d'Urberville family, the ancient lords of this manor
---
," she said,
"
---
that, in addition to their
 effect upon Tess, her fine features were unquestionably traceable
 in these exaggerated forms
---
," said she, very prettily, and. 
---
than she was
---
what every sensible woman
 would show
---
Tess knew,
 and.


---
that she had been thoughtful to excess
---
The sun was so low on that short last afternoon of the year that it
 shone in through a small opening and formed a golden staff which
 stretched across to her skirt, where it made a spot like a paint- mark
 set upon her. 
---
Looking at her silently for a long time;" She is a dear dear Tess,"

---
" Do I realize solemnly enough how utterly and

---
I think not. 
---
I think,. 
---
I could not
---
unless
 I were a woman myself
---
What I am in worldly estate
---
, she is. 
---
What I
 become
---
, she must become. 
---
What I can not be
---
, she can not be. 
---
And shall
 I ever neglect her, or? 
---
The woman had gone home for the night, but

---
she had placed candles upon the table, and
---
"," she answered, absent- minded.


---
I am sorry
---
I brought you here. 
---
I wonder?"


---
that she did
---
she
 was surcharged with emotion, and.

---
Though she tried
---
not to shed tears, she could not help.


---
" I did not mean it!"
---
" How vexing!" said Tess.


---
Tess looked a little flustered as she took it.


---
," said she,. 
---
" I do n't like
---
that she was
---
that on the death of your
    godmother, Mrs Pitney,, she-- vain,
    kind woman-- left to me a portion of the
    contents of her jewel- case in trust for your wife,
---
if
    you should ever have one, as a mark of her affection
    for you and
---
I have fulfilled, and
---
Though I feel
---
, I am, and
---
I believe,
---
" I do remember" but
---
Tess seemed afraid to touch them at first, but
---
her eyes sparkled for
 a moment as much as the stones when Clare spread out the set.


---
she asked incredulously.


---
His wife was a d'Urberville: whom could
 they become better than her?


---
But as if by magic she had already donned them-- necklace, ear- rings,
 bracelets, and all.


---
" said Tess.


---
when she had done this, and
---
the pendant to the necklace hung isolated
 amid the whiteness of her throat,
---
; a peasant girl but
 very moderately prepossessing to the casual observer in her simple
 condition and attire
---
Tess's sense of her striking appearance had given her a flush of
 excitement, which was yet not happiness.


---
," she said,"
---
, I suppose?
---
Influenced by a second thought she readily obeyed. 
---
She had something
 to tell, and
---
She sat down with the
 jewels upon her; and
---
I couldn
---
I opened the
 door. 
---
I've brought the things, sir.
---
" I am very glad to see them. 
---
" We've all been gallied at the dairy at what might ha' been a most
 terrible affliction since you and your Mis'ess-- so to name her
 now--. 
---
Why, she bade us goodbye with the rest--
---
as I say,
---
Retty and Marian put on
 their bonnets and
---
Well, sir, when you and your Mis'ess-- so to name what she
 lawful is-- went out; and not much doing now, being
 New Year's Eve, and folks mops and brooms from,
 nobody took much notice. 
---
Retty striking across the
 water- meads as if for home, and
---
Marian going on to the next village,
. 
---
o' Retty till the waterman, on his way home, noticed something by the
 Great Pool;'. 
---
she fetched round by degrees."


---
that Tess was overhearing this gloomy
 tale
---
where she was
---
his wife, flinging a shawl
 round her, had come to the outer room and.


---
, her eyes resting absently on the luggage and the drops of
 rain glistening upon it
---
; she's been found dead drunk
 by the withy- bed-- a girl who hev never been known to touch anything
 before except shilling ale;. 
---
though, to be sure,' a was always a good
 trencher- woman,
---
as her face showed
---
" And Izz?" asked Tess.


---
" Izz is about house as usual; but, poor maid,
 as well
---
she seems
---
she mid be. 
---
Tess had gone back to the inner parlour, and. 
---
She heard Jonathan Kail's heavy footsteps
 up and down the stairs, and

---
where she sat over the hearth
---
her to jump up gaily and

---
that she had been so anxious about
---
as she
 did not rise
---
" I am so sorry you should have heard this sad story about the girls
---
Retty was naturally
 morbid, you know.
---
"

" Without the least cause," said Tess. "
---
This incident had turned the scale for her. 
---
They were simple and
 innocent girls on whom the unhappiness of unrequited love had fallen
---
She had deserved
 worse-- yet
---
she was the chosen one. 
---
It was wicked of her. 
---
She would pay to the uttermost farthing
---
; she would
 tell, there and then. 
---
she came to
---
when she
 looked into the fire
---
Tess's face and neck
 reflected the same warmth, which each gem turned into an Aldebaran
 or a Sirius-- a constellation of white, red, and green flashes, that
 interchanged their hues with her every pulsation.


---
that she still
 remained immovable
---
" she said quickly, and even with
 gladness and relief.


---
because I want, and

---
as perhaps
 I ought
---
She did not speak,
 and
---
" I did not mention it
---
because I was afraid of endangering my chance
 of you, darling, the great prize of my life
---
-- my Fellowship I call
 you. 
---
Well, I would not risk it. 
---
I was going, but
---
I could not
---
;
 I thought. 
---
I put it off
---
; then I
 thought. 
---
I would tell you yesterday,
---
But I did not. 
---
And I did not this morning,--
---
that I
 was
---
But I must, now I see. 
---
I wonder
?"


---
I am sure that--"


---
" Well, I hope so. 
---
Though I imagine
---
that I am one
 of the eternally lost for my doctrines
---
, I am of course, a believer in
 good morals, Tess, as much as you. 
---
I used, and
---
when I found
---
I could not
 enter the Church
---
I admired spotlessness,. 
---
even though I could lay no
 claim to it, and
---
as I hope
---
I do now
---
when, in the midst of my fine aims for other people, I myself
 fell
---
" Happily I awoke almost immediately to a sense of my folly
---
" I would have no more to say to her, and
---
I came home. 
---
I
 have never repeated the offence. 
---
But I felt, and
---
I should like
---
I could not do so without
 telling this. 
---
She pressed his hand tightly for an answer.


---
I am almost glad--! 
---
I have

---
I have a confession, too
---
She jumped up joyfully at the hope.

---
," she cried," because' tis
 just the same!
---
She sat down again.


---
A large shadow of her
 shape rose upon the wall and ceiling. 
---
She bent forward,; and
.



---
at which
 each diamond on her neck gave a sinister wink like a toad's
---
she entered on her story of
 her acquaintance with Alec d'Urberville and its results, murmuring
 the words without flinching, and with her eyelids drooping down
---
THE FOURTH





 Phase the Fifth: The Woman Pays



 XXXV



---
Her narrative ended
---
Tess's voice throughout had hardly risen
 higher than its opening tone
---
she had not wept.


---
as her announcement progressed
---
as if it did not care in the least
 about her strait
---
And yet nothing had
 changed since the moments when he had been kissing her; or rather,
 nothing in the substance of things. 
---
When she ceased
---
After
 stirring the embers; all the force of her
 disclosure had imparted itself now. 
---
I will tell you now."

" Am I?  From your manner I am.
" I am not out of my mind," she said.


---
I hindered you,
---
I remember!"


---
Tess followed him to the middle of the room,
. 
---
Presently she slid down upon her knees beside his foot, and
 from this position she crouched in a heap.


---
she whispered with a dry
 mouth. 
---
" I have forgiven you for the same!"


---
And,, she said again--

" Forgive me as you are forgiven! 
---
" she shrieked. 
---
, sickly white, she jumped up.


---
" she cried out. 
---
" I have been hoping, longing, praying,! 
---
I have

---
what an unworthy wife I shall
 be
---
if I do not
---
what I have felt
---
" I know that."


---
" I thought, Angel,! 
---
Having begun to love you, I love you for ever-- in all
 changes, in all disgraces,. 
---
I ask no more.

---
I repeat
---
I have been loving
---
", the woman is not you."


---
She perceived in his words the realization of her own apprehensive
 foreboding in former times. 
---
Terror was
 upon her white face
---
as she saw it
---
; her cheek was flaccid, and
---
her
 mouth had almost the aspect of a round little hole.
---
that she staggered,
---
she was going
---
She did sit down, without knowing where she was,
---
" she asked
 helplessly. 
---
her to take pity upon herself as one who was
 ill- used
---
Her eyes filled
---
as she regarded her position further
---
; she
 turned round and.


---
till the violence of her grief had worn itself out, and
---
her rush of
 weeping had lessened to a catching gasp at intervals.


---
" Angel," she said suddenly, in her natural tones
---
, the insane, dry
 voice of terror having left her now. 
---
" I have not been able to think what we can do."


---
" I sha n't ask you, no right to! 
---
because I have

---
I shall not write to mother and sisters; and
---
To fling elaborate
 sarcasms at Tess, however, was much like flinging them at a dog or
 cat. 
---
passed by her unappreciated,
---
and
 she only received them as inimical sounds which meant that anger
 ruled. 
---
She remained mute,. 
---
She hardly observed.

---
" Tess I can not stay-- in this
 room-- just now.
---
; she could not stay.

---
Hastily flinging her cloak around her she opened the door and
.

---
as if she were never coming back
---
She was soon close at his heels,. 
---
she felt as sarcasm the touch of the
 jewels of which she had been momentarily so proud. 
---
as she passed
---
; she would not have known--
---
if she had not seen them there
---
, she kept easily in sight of him. 
---
;
 she knew;

---
her companionship had now
 insufficient power to break or divert the strain of thought. 
---
She could not help
.


---
But she went on pleading in her distraction; and
---
" O Angel-- my mother says, and the husband has not
 minded it much-- has got over it at least. 
---
And yet the woman had not
 loved him!"


---
you are an unapprehending peasant woman, who
 have never been initiated into the proportions of social things
---
She spoke with an impulse to anger, but
---
Retty's family were
 once large landowners, and
---
She took these reproaches in their bulk simply, not in their
 particulars
---
to all else she was indifferent
---
During the interval of coming, she had said
 to her husband--


---
" I do n't see. 
---
how I can help
---
I can put an end to myself in
 it. 
---
I am not afraid.
---
" I do n't wish
---
in obeying his direction she only had. 
---
When she
 got back
---
as she had left it
---
She did not stay downstairs for more than a minute,
 but.

---
Here she sat down on the edge of the bed,. 
---
she lifted the candle.

---
; she knew that in an
 instant.
---
This was the explanation of that mysterious parcel which it
 had been so difficult to pack and bring; whose contents he would not
 explain to her, saying that time would soon show her the purpose
 thereof. 
---
Having nothing more to fear, having scarce anything to hope, there seemed no promise whatever, she lay down dully.

---
When sorrow ceases to be speculative, sleep sees her opportunity.

---
possibly, been the bride- chamber of her own ancestry
---
Her measured breathing told
.


---
that she was sleeping profoundly
---
so-- that having shifted the burden of her life to his shoulders, she
 was now reposing without care.


---
Tess's had been; and
---
as Tess had seemed
 possible all the long
---
that her heart was not

---
Tess had no advocate
. 
---
which, were yet ever seeing another world behind her
 ostensible one, discordant and contrasting?


---
that it would be the neighbouring
 cottager's wife, who was to minister to their wants while they
 remained here
---
She had. 
---
" I will," said she dutifully.

 then going to the foot of the
 stairs, called in a conventional voice--

" Breakfast is ready!"


---
she was already in the
 sitting- room. 
---
As she
 was fully attired, and the interval since his calling her had been
 but two or three minutes
---
, she must have been dressed or nearly so
. 
---
Her hair was twisted up in a large
 round mass at the back of her head, and
---
she had put on one of the
 new frocks-- a pale blue woollen garment with neck- frillings of
 white. 
---
Her hands and face appeared, and
---
she had possibly
 been sitting a long time without any fire.

---
when she looked at him
---
she replied with a like
 undemonstrativeness. 
---
At last she came up to him,.


---
that her own
 formed a visible object also
---
she said, and. 
---
as though she could hardly believe
---
who was once her lover
---
Her eyes were bright,
---
her pale
 cheek still showed its wonted roundness,
---
the usually ripe red mouth was
 almost as pale as her cheek. 
---
as she was still
---
,
 under the stress of her mental grief the life beat so brokenly that
 a little further pull upon it
---
would cause real illness, dull her
 characteristic eyes, and make her mouth thin.


---
She looked absolutely pure. 
---
Nature, in her fantastic trickery, had
 set such a seal of maidenhood upon Tess's countenance that he gazed
 at her with a stupefied air.


---
However, she only repeated--


---
Tess felt his position so entirely that the remainder had not been
 needed. 
---
; she saw.


---
you would never--"

 Her voice grew husky
---
she whispered
---
As she did not answer
---
She writhed under this inquisitorial manner of his. 
---
" Last night,"
 she answered.


---
she said,.

---
But I could not-- do the last thing!

---
I was afraid that it might cause a scandal to your name."


---
The unexpected quality of this confession, wrung from her, and
---
" But, Angel," she pleaded,,". 
---
Since the desperation of the night
 her activities had dropped to zero, and
---
Tess tried, and
---
Tess stood at the window, and.

---
Then, without a sigh, she turned her attention to the room, and.


---
Her presence was at first a strain upon
 Tess, but afterwards an alleviation. 
---
Her face flushed,. 
---
She ran to the kitchen. 
---
," said she.


---
She feared.


---
she was in the way
 and,
---
when the old woman was gone,
---
where she
 made herself busy as well as she could for more than an hour
---
; you are my wife."


---
She raised her eyes, and. 
---
" she murmured, in piteous raillery. 
---
," she said hastily, with tears in her accents. 
---
" I
 thought
---
because I am not respectable
---
, I mean. 
---
I told you"


---
I
 thought-- and
---
I was not respectable enough long ago
---
on that account
 I did n't want
---
She broke into sobs, and. 
---
till her sobbing ceased
---
" I wish in an ebullition of bitterness against womankind in general.

---
half the women in England were as respectable as you
---
But Tess did not think of this
---
; she took everything as her deserts,
 and. 
---
as she naturally was
---
; quick- tempered, nothing
 made her unseemly; she sought not her own
---
She might just
 now have been Apostolic Charity herself
---
she replied in the same words, at the same time
. 
---
" I shall be home punctually."


---
Tess shrank into herself. 
---
as if she had been struck
---
gaily that her mouth and breath tasted of the butter and eggs and
 milk and honey
---
on which she mainly lived,
---
" Yes," said Tess absently.


---
It
 was evident to her. 
---
She
 was. 
---
She no longer
 expected forgiveness now. 
---
than once she thought of going away
 from him during his absence at the mill
---
but she feared.


---
her to break the reserve about their future which had
 hitherto prevailed
---
"
 she asked,.


---
the sunk corners of her mouth betraying
---
how purely
 mechanical were the means by which she retained that expression of
 chastened calm upon her face
---
Her eyelids, weighted with trouble,.


---
" I can not say','" she answered,"."


---
I can not
---
; I had not thought
 so far
---
Tess's feminine hope had been so obstinately
 recuperative as to revive in her surreptitious visions of a
 domiciliary intimacy. 
---
Though unsophisticated in the usual
 sense, she was not incomplete; and
---
if she had not instinctively known
---
Nothing else would serve her. 
---
, she knew,
---
to hope in,
 she said to herself: yet that sort of hope she could not extinguish.

---
as she said
---
She had truly never thought so far as that, and
---
who would scorn her
---
Sheer experience had already taught her
---
Like all
, she could, in the words of
 M. Sully- Prudhomme, hear a penal sentence in the fiat,.


---
that, till now, Tess
 had been hoodwinked by her love for Clare into forgetting it might
 result in vitalizations that would inflict upon others what she had
 bewailed as misfortune to herself
---
She therefore could not withstand his argument. 
---
It was based
 on her exceptional physical nature; and
---
she might have used it
 promisingly.
---
She might have added besides:"
---
Yet, like the majority of women, she accepted
 the momentary presentment. 
---
And she
 may have been right. 
---
The intuitive heart of woman knoweth not only
 its own bitterness, but its husband's, and
---
She found. 
---
that her personality did not plead her cause
 so forcibly as she had anticipated
---
she was another woman than the one who had excited his desire.


---
" I have thought over what you say,". 
---
she remarked to him,, her other hand, which bore the ring
 that mocked them both, supporting her forehead
---
" I can go home."


---
Though she did not look up at him
---
, she started. 
---
There was a
 difference between the proposition and the covenant, which she had
 felt only too quickly.


---
" she murmured,
---
her countenance
 meekly fixed. 
---
Tess stole a glance at her husband. 
---
she went upstairs and. 
---
she knew,;. 
---
though the fascination-- on her part independently of accomplishments-- would
 probably in the first days of their separation be even more potent
 than ever
---
the practical arguments
 against accepting her as a housemate might pronounce themselves more
 strongly in the boreal light of a remoter view
---
Tess,, heard it and awoke. 
---
She saw the
 door of her bedroom open, and
---
her first flush of joy died.

---
when she
 perceived
---
Tess saw.


---
she would not
---
she found herself in
---
Thus she lay
 in absolute stillness,
---
Self- solicitude was near
 extinction in her, and
---
in the knowledge to depart
 on the morrow, possibly for always, she lay in his arms in this
 precarious position with a sense rather of luxury than of terror. 
---
she found. 
---
herself conjecturing on the matter
---
So easefully had she delivered her whole. 
---
that it pleased her
---
now she knew-- that Sunday morning when he
 had borne her along through the water with the other dairymaids, who
 had loved him nearly as much as she, if that were possible, which
 Tess could hardly admit. 
---
Tess had noticed from the window of the house in the day- time young
 men walking across upon it as a feat in balancing. 
---
her would have been a loving one,, and
---
The impulse stirred in her, yet
---
she dared not indulge it,. 
---
How
 she valued her own life
---
his-- she had no right to
 tamper with it. 
---
Tess sat up in the coffin. 
---
She had heard of such deaths after
 sleep- walking. 
---
But how could she dare, and? 
---
Tess, however, stepping out of her
 stone confine,. 
---
for she
 was beginning,
---
It suddenly occurred to her; and
---
accordingly she
 whispered in his ear, with as much firmness and decision as she could
 summon--

. 
---
she had risen as a
 spirit
---
Thus she conducted him by the
 arm to the stone bridge in front of their residence,. 
---
Tess's feet were quite bare, and

---
the stones hurt her, and; but
---
She induced him, and. 
---
she thought.

---
As soon Tess divined little or nothing of how far she had been concerned in the night's
 excursion
---
It just crossed her mind, too,.


---
She saw in it the beginning of
 the end-- the temporary end,. 
---
to wind
 up his business with Mr Crick, Tess could hardly avoid at the same time,.


---
unless she would excite suspicion of
 their unhappy state
---
though Marian and Retty did not
 seem
---
Tess valiantly bore their sly attacks and friendly humours, which
 affected her far otherwise than they supposed. 
---
although she
 would rather there had been no word spoken on the subject
---
And then,, Tess had
. 
---
Marian had left. 
---
she would come to no good
---
To dissipate the sadness of this recital Tess went and
---
as
 she and Clare stood side by side at leaving,
---
Mrs Crick said to her husband--


---
" How onnatural the brightness of her eyes did seem, and
---
she's not now quite like the proud young bride of a
 well- be- doing man."


---
were next driven onward towards her home by a
 stranger who did not know their relations
---
if she meant
---
that to return
 to her mother's house it was here
---
accompany him for a few steps on foot along one of the branch roads she assented, and.


---
The severity of the decree seemed deadly to Tess
---
; she saw his view of
 her clearly enough
---
even what she had done
---
Yet could a woman
 deserve all this? 
---
But she could
 contest the point with him no further. 
---
She simply repeated after him
 his own words.


---
That was all she said on the matter. 
---
If Tess had been artful, had

---
she made a scene, in that lonely lane,
 notwithstanding the fury of fastidiousness with which he was
 possessed
---
she herself was
 his best advocate. 
---
Pride, too, entered into her submission-- which
 perhaps was a symptom of that reckless acquiescence in chance too
 apparent in the whole d'Urberville family-- and the many effective
 chords which she could have stirred by an appeal were left untouched.


---
to this she readily agreed.


---
it go with an
 unpremeditated hope that Tess would look out of the window for one
 moment
---
But that she never thought of doing,. 
---
When Tess had passed over the crest of the hill he turned to go his
 own way, and.




---
As she drove on through Blackmoor Vale, and
---
the landscape of her
 youth began
---
to open around her, Tess aroused herself from her stupor.

---
Her first thought was?


---
how would she be able to face her parents
---
She reached a turnpike- gate which stood upon the highway to the
 village. 
---
Having received no intelligence lately from her home, she
 asked the turnpike- keeper for news.


---
John's
 wife sung songs at The Pure Drop till past eleven o'clock."


---
Hearing this, Tess felt so sick at heart that she could not decide
 to go home publicly in the fly with her luggage and belongings. 
---
She
 asked the turnpike- keeper
---
if she might deposit her things at his
 house for a while, and, on his offering no objection
---
, she dismissed
 her carriage, and.


---
At sight of her father's chimney she asked herself? 
---
how she could
 possibly enter the house
---
her relations were

---
she was, friendless,
---
She did not reach the house unobserved. 
---
she
 was met by a girl who knew her-- one of the two or three with whom she
 had been intimate at school. 
---
how
 Tess came there, her friend,"
---
Tess hastily explained,
.


---
As she went up the garden- path
---
she heard. 
---
her mother singing by the
 back door,
---
of which she perceived Mrs Durbeyfield on
 the doorstep in the act of wringing a sheet
---
Having performed this
 without observing Tess, she went indoors, and
---
her daughter followed
 her.


---
her mother, having thrown the sheet aside, was
 about to plunge her arms in anew.


---
married!--married really and
-- we sent the cider--"

" Yes, mother
---
; so I am."


---
" No-- I am married."


---
Tess went across to Joan Durbeyfield,. 
---
Tess was convulsed with weeping, the tension of so many days having
 relaxed at last.


---
she gasped through her sobs. 
---
Tess was so shaken.


---
that she could get no further, and
---
I do n't know," she continued
---
that she would break the bad news to him
 herself,
---
Tess keeping out of sight for the present
---
After her first
 burst of disappointment Joan began.


---
as she had

---
as she would have taken a wet holiday
 or failure in the potato- crop
---
Tess retreated upstairs and beheld casually that the beds had been
 shifted, and new arrangements made. 
---
Her old bed had been adapted for
 two younger children. 
---
There was no place here for her now.


---
she could hear most of what went on
 there. 
---
As Tess had wished
---
she would remove that prohibition soon
---
that the couple should take Tess's own name, d'Urberville,
 as uncorrupted
---
It was better than her husbands's. 
---
if any
 letter had come from her that day
---
Tess
 unfortunately had come herself.


---
But she can make?"


---
But she wo n't think."


---
is it like the first--"

 Poor Tess, who had heard as far as this,
---
that her word could be doubted even here, in her own
 parental house,
---
The perception set her mind against the spot as nothing else could
 have done. 
---
And, would not neighbours and acquaintance
 doubt her much? 
---
O, she could not live long at home!


---
that she allowed herself here, at
 the end of which time she received a short note from Clare, informing
 her that he had gone to the North of England to look at a farm
---
to
 hide from her parents the vast extent of the division between them,
 she made use of this letter as her reason for again departing,
. 
---
that she was setting out
---
Still further to screen her husband from any imputation of
 unkindness to her, she took twenty- five of the fifty pounds Clare
. 
---
as if the wife
 of a man like Angel Clare could well afford it,
---
that it was a
 slight return for the trouble and humiliation she had brought upon
 them in years past
---
With this assertion of her dignity she bade them
 farewell; and
---
after that there were lively doings in the Durbeyfield
 household for some time on the strength of Tess's bounty, her mother
 and.




---
that Tess came of that exhausted ancient line, and
---
Tess could eventually join him
 there, and perhaps in that country of contrasting scenes and notions
 and habits the conventions would not be so operative which made life
 with her seem impracticable to him here. 
---
-- where's your wife, dear Angel?"
---
" She is at her mother's-- temporarily. 
---
that none of us should be
 present, not at her home,
---
particularly if she suits you for
 the business you have chosen to follow instead of the ministry of the
 Gospel
---
We sent her no present of our own,
 not knowing what would best give her pleasure, but you must suppose
 it only delayed. 
---
till we could see her
---
And now you have not brought her. 
---
that she should to
 go her parents' home for the present,
---
she could
 come with credit to you
---
for me to take her on this my
 first journey
---
She will remain at her mother's."


---
for them to see her
---
till she had almost
 fancied
---
She watched her son.


---
" Can not you describe her? 
---
" And that she is pure and virtuous?"


---
" Pure and virtuous, of course, she is."


---
You said the other day that she was
 fine in figure large eyes violety- bluey- blackish."


---
she naturally had

---
till she saw
 you
---
" I did, mother."

" I quite see her. " Scarcely."

" You were her first love?"


---
" There are worse wives than these simple, rosy- mouthed, robust girls
 of the farm. 
---
that his wife should
 have been accustomed to an outdoor life
---
( she
 could cite chapter and verse as well as her husband)
---
May Heaven shield her in all her ways!"


---
" Who can find a virtuous woman?
---
She riseth, and
    giveth meat to her household. 
---
She girdeth her loins
    with strength and strengtheneth her arms. 
---
She
    perceiveth; her candle
    goeth not out by night. 
---
that her merchandise is good
---
She looketh well to the ways
    of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness.
   
---
Her children arise up and
---
that chapter your dear
 father read, in some of its particulars, to the woman you
 have chosen
---
The perfect woman,, was a working woman; not an
 idler; not a fine lady; but one who used her hands and her head and
 her heart for the good of others. 
---
' Her children arise up and
---
her blessed;
---
she excelleth them all.' 
---
Since she is pure and chaste
---
, she would
 have been refined enough for me."


---
His mother followed him, and. 
---
she asked,"
---
I am quite sure you are not yourself.
---
I am not, quite, mother
---
it is about her
---
is she a young woman whose history will bear investigation?
---
" She is spotless!"
---
as if she had been in the room
---
This night the woman of his belittling deprecations was thinking. 
---
that essentially this young wife of his was,
---
her moral value having
---
what Tess was not
---
what she was
---
She was carrying an armful of
 Bibles for her class, and
---
that events wrought beatific smiles upon her-- an
 enviable result,.


---
She had learnt, and.


---
" she said severely.


---
which
 appeared on her fair face
---
She thought; and
---
as she had made it with her own hands on the morning of
 leaving
---
a woman standing
---
," she said,"
---
I thought."


---
This was a girl whose secret he had guessed, but
---
" I am here alone." 
---
," she said.


---
Izz looked down.


---
that I left
---
I am staying out this way.
---
She pointed in a contrary direction, the direction in which he was
 journeying.


---
I can take you."


---
Her olive complexion grew richer in hue.


---
" Thank' ee, Mr Clare," she said.


---
On Clare's return to his horse
 and gig, Izz jumped up beside him.


---
" I am going.

---
she asked.


---
She is not going at present
---
I am going out
."


---
They sped along eastward for some considerable distance, Izz making
 no observation.


---
" How is Retty?"


---
" She was in a sort of nervous state; and so thin
 and hollow- cheeked. 
---
when I zid her last
---
Nobody will ever
 fall in love wi' her any more," said Izz absently.


---
Izz lowered her voice.


---
The dairyman has got rid of her."


---
" I do n't drink, and
---
I bain't in a decline. 
---
But-- I am no great things
 at singing afore breakfast now!"


---
I had asked YOU" If you had I should have said' Yes', and you would have married a
 woman who loved' ee!"


---
" she whispered vehemently. 
---
" I must get down.  I live out there," said Izz abruptly,.


---
" I am going to Brazil alone, Izz
---
-- will you go with me
 instead of her?
---
," said Izz, after a pause.


---
that I shall live with you for the time you are over
 there
---
But I ought
.
---
" I do n't mind that
---
; no woman do, and
!"


---
She shook her head.


---
" I do-- I have said I do!  I loved you all the time we was at the
 dairy together!"

" No," she murmured," not more than she."


---
Because nobody could love' ee more than Tess did
---
She would
 have laid down her life for' ee. 
---
Izz Huett would fain
---
the fascination exercised over her
 rougher nature by Tess's character.


---
I could do no more."

" SHE
 WOULD HAVE LAID DOWN HER LIFE FOR' EE. 
---
" Forget our idle talk, Izz turning the horse's head
 suddenly. 
---
Izz Huett burst into wild tears, and.


---
as she saw

---
what she had done
---
She stilled herself by degrees.


---
she hopped down.


---
She was a really generous girl, and.


---
she said.


---
while she stood beside him there,
---
when you see her
---
that she is
---
that, and tell Retty,--
---
that for my sake she is
---
And you, Izzy, you have saved me by your
 honest words about my wife from an incredible impulse towards folly
 and treachery. 
---
Women may be bad, but
---
She gave the promise.


---
no sooner had Izz turned into the lane, and
---
than she flung herself down on the bank in a fit of
 racking anguish
---
that she
 entered her mother's cottage late that night
---
how Izz spent the dark hours that intervened between Angel Clare's
 parting from her and her arrival home
---
No; it was a sense that, despite her love, as corroborated by Izz's
 admission, the facts had not changed. 
---
when she was no bride
---
her a lonely woman with a basket and a bundle in her own porterage,
 as at an earlier time; instead of the ample
 means, she can produce only a flattened purse.


---
After again leaving Marlott, her home, she had got through the
 spring and summer without any great stress upon her physical powers,

---
the time being mainly spent in rendering light irregular service
 at dairy- work near Port- Bredy to the west of the Blackmoor Valley,
 equally remote from her native place and from Talbothays. 
---
She
 preferred this to living on his allowance. 
---
Mentally she remained in
 utter stagnation, a condition which the mechanical occupation rather
 fostered than checked. 
---
Her consciousness was at that other dairy,
 at that other season
---
she had grasped him
---
who, the moment to keep
 for her own, had disappeared like a shape in a vision
---
for she
 had not met with a second regular engagement as at Talbothays, but

---
However, as harvest was now
 beginning, she had simply, and
---
to which
 she had put them
---
Of the five- and- twenty pounds, after deducting the other half of the fifty as a
 contribution to her parents for the trouble and expense, she had as yet spent but little. 
---
during which she was

---
She could not bear. 
---
But
 she had, and one by one they left her hands.


---
She had been compelled, but
---
she concealed her circumstances. 
---
When her money had almost
 gone a letter from her mother
---
Joan stated
---
, could she not send them the money?


---
Tess had thirty pounds coming to her almost immediately from Angel's
 bankers, and,. 
---
she sent the twenty
---
she was obliged. 
---
whenever she required further
 resources
---
that she was
---
But the more Tess thought of the step, the more reluctant was she
---
The same delicacy, pride, false shame, hindered her owning to

---
that she was in want after the fair allowance he had left her
---
They probably despised her already
---
that by no
 effort could the parson's daughter- in- law bring herself
---
with her own the
 reverse obtained. 
---
from that time to the
 present she had done nothing; in any
 case that they would soon present a united front to their families
 and the world. 
---
that she was

---
she still fostered
---
her parents
 know
---
that she was a deserted wife, dependent, now
---
that she had

---
The set of brilliants returned to her mind. 
---
she did not know,
---
that she could only use and
---
when the last of Tess's sovereigns
 had been spent
---
she was unprovided with others
---
that to take their place,
 while on account of the season she found it increasingly difficult
 to get employment
---
Not being aware of the rarity of intelligence,
 energy, health, and willingness in any sphere of life, she refrained
 from seeking an indoor occupation;. 
---
Society might be better than she supposed from her slight experience
 of it. 
---
But she had no proof of this, and
---
her instinct in the
 circumstances was.


---
in which she
 had served as supernumerary milkmaid during the spring and summer

---
Room would probably have been made for her
 at Talbothays,
---
if only out of sheer compassion; but comfortable as
 her life had been there
---
, she could not go back. 
---
She could not have borne their pity, and their
 whispered remarks to one another upon her strange situation
---
; though
 she would almost have faced a knowledge of her circumstances by every
 individual there, so long as her story had remained isolated in the
 mind of each. 
---
It was the interchange of ideas about her that made
 her sensitiveness wince. 
---
Tess could not account for this
 distinction
---
; she simply knew.


---
that she felt it
---
She was now on her way to an upland farm in the centre of the county,
. 
---
to which she had been recommended by a wandering letter which had
 reached her from Marian
---
Marian had somehow heard.


---
that Tess was
 separated from her husband-- probably through Izz Huett-- and the
 good- natured and now tippling girl,
---
that she herself had gone to

---
that she worked again as of old
---
there was something of the
 habitude of the wild animal in the unreflecting instinct with which
 she rambled on--.


---
which might make a quick discovery of her
 whereabouts by others of importance to her own happiness, if not to
 theirs
---
she excited by her appearance, a certain bearing of
 distinction, which she had caught from Clare, being superadded to her
 natural attractiveness
---
Whilst the clothes lasted prepared for her marriage
---
, these casual glances of interest caused
 her no inconvenience, but; but
---
as she was compelled
---
as soon to don the
 wrapper of a fieldwoman, rude words were addressed to her more than
 once
---
She had preferred the country west of the River Brit to the upland
 farm for which she was now bound,. 
---
that she might decide
---
But having once decided to
 try the higher and drier levels, she pressed back eastward,.


---
she meant
---
owing to the rapid shortening of
 the days, dusk came upon her. 
---
before she was aware
---
She had reached
 the top of a hill down which the lane stretched its serpentine length
 in glimpses,
---
when she heard footsteps behind her back, and
---
in a few
 moments she was overtaken by a man. 
---
to which she civilly replied
---
lit up her face,. 
---
I was there at that time, though

---
I do n't live there now."


---
She recognized in him the well- to- do boor whom Angel had knocked down
 at the inn for addressing her coarsely. 
---
she returned him no answer.


---
Still no answer came from Tess. 
---
There seemed only one escape for her
 hunted soul. 
---
She suddenly took to her heels with the speed of the
 wind, and,. 
---
till she
 came to a gate which opened directly into a plantation
---
Into this
 she plunged, and.


---
till she was deep enough in its shade

---
She scraped together the dead leaves. 
---
till she had formed
 them into a large heap,
---
Into
 this Tess crept.


---
as she got
---
Such sleep was naturally fitful; she fancied, but. 
---
she heard
 strange noises
---
She thought of her husband in some vague warm clime on the
 other side of the globe,. 
---
while she was here in the cold
---
what I said in the town Tess asked
 herself; and,."

---
She repeated the words mechanically,. 
---
till she reflected
---
; she herself,
 though not in the van of thinkers, had got much further. 
---
The wife of Angel
 Clare put her hand to her brow, and, and the edges of
 her eye- sockets perceptible under the soft skin, and thought as she
 did so that a time would come when that bone would be bare. 
---
I wish

---
"," she said.


---
she heard a new strange sound
 among the leaves
---
Soon she was certain. 
---
Had she been ensconced here under
 other and more pleasant conditions
---
she would have become alarmed;
 but
---
, outside humanity, she had at present no fear.


---
, she crept from under her hillock of leaves, and

---
Then she perceived. 
---
wherein she had taken shelter
---
Tess guessed at once the meaning of this. 
---
as she had heard them
---
She had occasionally caught glimpses of these men in girlhood,
. 
---
She
 had been told.


---
who could feel for kindred sufferers as
 much as for herself
---
With the impulse of a soul, Tess's first thought was and
---
to this end with her own hands she
 broke the necks of as many as she could find,.


---
where she had found them
---
" she exclaimed, her tears
 running down as she killed the birds tenderly. 
---
I be, and
---
I be not bleeding,
---
and
 I have two hands to feed and clothe me." 
---
She was ashamed of herself
 for her gloom of the night,.




---
she started again,. 
---
Tess went onward with fortitude, her recollection of the
 birds' silent endurance of their night of agony impressing upon her
 the relativity of sorrows and the tolerable nature of her own,. 
---
if she
 could once rise high enough
---
But that she could
 not do so long as it was held by Clare.


---
She reached Chalk- Newton, and.

---
Somehow she felt hopeful,? 
---
for was it not possible that her husband
 also might say these same things to her even yet
---
She was bound to
. 
---
To this end Tess resolved. 
---
as she got out of the village she entered a
 thicket and took from her basket one of the oldest field- gowns, which
 she had never put on even at the dairy-- never since she had worked
 among the stubble at Marlott
---
She also, by a felicitous thought,
 took a handkerchief from her bundle and.
---
as if
 she were suffering from toothache
---
Then with her little scissors,
 by the aid of a pocket looking- glass, she mercilessly nipped her
 eyebrows off, and
---
, she
 went on her uneven way.


---
" What a mommet of a maid!" said the next man who met her to a
 companion.


---
Tears came into her eyes for very pity of herself.


---
as she heard him
---
she said. 
---
" O no-- I do n't care! 
---
I'll always be
 ugly now,. 
---
I have
---
I love him just the same, and!"


---
Thus Tess walks on; a figure which is part of the landscape; a
 fieldwoman pure and simple, in winter guise; a gray serge cape, a
 red woollen cravat, a stuff skirt covered by a whitey- brown rough
 wrapper, and buff- leather gloves. 
---
There is no sign of young passion
 in her now--


     
---
The maiden's mouth is cold
     ...
     
---
she trudged on, the honesty,
 directness, and impartiality of elemental enmity disconcerting her
 but little. 
---
Her object being a winter's occupation and a winter's
 home
---
Her experience of short hirings
 had been such.


---
that she was determined
---
Thus she went forward from farm to farm in the direction of the place

---
whence Marian had written to her,,. 
---
she determined
---
First she inquired for the lighter kinds of employment,
 and,
---
that she liked best
---
as acceptance in any variety of these grew hopeless, applied
 next for the less light, till, beginning with the dairy and poultry
 tendance, she ended with the heavy and course
 pursuits which she liked least--.


---
as she would never have deliberately voluteered
 for
---
Towards the second evening she reached the irregular chalk table- land
 or plateau, bosomed with semi- globular tumuli--.


---
which stretched between
 the valley of her birth and the valley of her love
---
In the middle distance ahead of
 her she could see the summits of Bulbarrow and of Nettlecombe Tout,
 and
---
though as approached on the other side from Blackmoor
 in her childhood they were as lofty bastions against the sky.

---
Southerly, at many miles' distance, and over the hills and ridges
 coastward, she could discern a surface like polished steel
---
She had
---
to be no help for it; hither she was doomed to
. 
---
The stubborn soil around her showed plainly enough that the
 kind of labour in demand here was of the roughest kind; but
---
she resolved. 
---
before applying for a lodging
 she stood under its shelter, and.


---
I was Mrs Angel Clare
---
she said.


---
The wall felt warm to her back and shoulders, and
---
she found. 
---
She warmed her hands upon them, and
. 
---
she had
---
She had so little wish to leave it that she could have stayed there
 all night.


---
Tess could hear the occupants of the cottage--
---
But in the village- street she
 had seen no soul as yet. 
---
Tess
 instinctively thought, and
---
when she came near
 enough to be distinguishable in the gloom
---
, surely enough it was
 she. 
---
Marian was,
 and decidedly shabbier in attire. 
---
At any previous period of her
 existence Tess would hardly have cared; but
---
her loneliness was excessive, and
---
she responded
 readily to Marian's greeting.


---
Marian was quite respectful in her inquiries, but.


---
that Tess should still continue in no better condition
 than at first
---
; though she had dimly heard of the separation
---
I merely did it
---
She pulled off in disgust a bandage which could suggest such wild
 thoughts.


---
( Tess had been accustomed).


---
" I know it, Marian."


---
" I've not lost it. 
---
I do n't care anything about my
 looks; and
---
so I did n't put it on
---
" Yes, I do; but not in public. 
---
I wear it round my neck on a ribbon.

---
I do n't wish
---
who I am by marriage
---
that I am

---
while I lead my present life
---
" But you BE a gentleman's wife; and
---
"; though I am very unhappy."


---
"; that I'm sure of. 
---
Though I be
 here myself
---
, I feel' tis a pity for such as you to come."


---
Yes; but I've got out o' that since I took to drink. 
---
what I be doing
---
if I get the
 place
---
I do n't wish."


---
who was really a trustworthy girl though of coarser grain
 than Tess
---
Marian,, promised anything she asked.


---
"," she said," and
---
I be real sorry that you are not happy; but
---
' tis
, I know. 
---
"; I could not!"


---
Tess waited outside the door of the farmhouse, and
---
then Marian introduced her.

---
his wife,, made no objection to hiring Tess, on
 her agreeing to remain till Old Lady- Day. 
---
Having signed the agreement, there was nothing more for Tess to do
 at present, and
---
she found one in the house at
 whose gable- wall she had warmed herself. 
---
that she had ensured
---
That night she wrote. 
---
But she
 did not tell them of the sorriness of her situation
---
There was no exaggeration in Marian's definition of Flintcomb- Ash
 farm as a starve- acre place. 
---
she was an importation. 
---
But Tess set to work. 
---
it sustained her.


---
in which she and her companion were set hacking
---
it was the
 business of the two women.

---
Marian said. 
---
Tess had not
 known till now what was really meant by that. 
---
they were talking of the time when they lived
 and loved together at Talbothays Dairy, that happy green tract of
 land where summer had been liberal in her gifts; in substance to
 all, emotionally to these. 
---
Tess would fain not have conversed with
 Marian of the man who was legally, if not actually, her husband;
 but. 
---
the irresistible fascination of the subject betrayed her into

---
?" said Tess, awake to the new value of this locality.


---
Marian's
 will had a method of assisting itself by taking from her pocket as

---
the afternoon wore on a pint bottle corked with white rag, from which
 she invited Tess to drink. 
---
Tess's unassisted power of dreaming,
 however, being enough for her sublimation at present
---
, she declined
 except the merest sip, and
---
then Marian took a pull from the spirits.


---
I've got used to it
---
"," she said," and. 
---
I lost him: you did n't
---
Tess thought her loss as great as Marian's, but.


---
, she accepted Marian's
 differentiation
---
Amid this scene Tess slaved in the morning frosts and in
. 
---
Still Tess hoped. 
---
She had a conviction that sooner or later the
 magnanimity which she persisted in reckoning as a chief ingredient
 of Clare's character would lead him to rejoin her.


---
Marian, primed to a humorous mood,
---
would discover the queer- shaped
 flints aforesaid, and shriek with laughter, Tess remaining severely
 obtuse. 
---
" Ah," said Marian,"! 
---
how I should like another or two of our old set

---
Marian's eyes softened, and
---
her voice grew vague. 
---
" I'll write to Izz Huett
---
," she said. 
---
She's

---
I know,
---
and I'll tell her, and and
---
perhaps Retty is well enough now."


---
Tess had nothing to say against the proposal, and
---
she heard
 of this plan for importing old Talbothays' joys
---
when Marian informed her
---
that Izz had replied to her inquiry,
 and
---
if she could
---
These nameless birds came quite near to Tess and Marian, but
---
, they dismissed experiences which they did not
 value for the immediate incidents of this homely upland-- the trivial
 movements of the two girls in disturbing the clods with their hackers
 so as to uncover something or other that these visitants relished as
 food.


---
When she lit her lamp
---
she found. 
---
on which her shoes left tracks
---
when she moved about
---
Tess knew; and
---
she had finished breakfast beside the solitary little lamp
---
by
 the time,
 Marian arrived. 
---
But both the young women were fairly cheerful
---
," said
 Marian. 
---
, my dear, is, I make no doubt,. 
---
," said Tess severely.


---
in which she imagined South America
---
" Well, well, I know. 
---
There-- I wo n't say another word! 
---
I can stand it; but
---
because
 I'm stout
---
I ca n't think."


---
for
 the women to draw from during the day
---
" Why, here's Izz!"
---
Marian.

 Izz it was
---
she came forward. 
---
She had walked all the way from
 her mother's home on the previous afternoon, and,,. 
---
The farmer had agreed
 with her mother at market, and
---
if she came to- day
---
she
 had been afraid to disappoint him by delay.


---
In addition to Tess, Marian, and Izz, there were two women from a
 neighbouring village; two Amazonian sisters, whom Tess with a start
 remembered as Dark Car, the Queen of Spades, and her junior, the
 Queen of Diamonds-- those who had tried to fight with her in the
 midnight quarrel at Trantridge. 
---
They showed no recognition of her,
 and. 
---
The girls
 pulled handful after handful from the press; but by reason of the
 presence of the strange women, who were recounting scandals, Marian
 and Izz could not at first talk of old times as they wished to do.

---
She had

---
when she perceived
---
till she had carried the drawn bundles to the pile outside,

---
So you be the young woman who took my civility in such
 ill part
---
Tess, between the Amazons and the farmer, like a bird caught in a
 clap- net, returned no answer,. 
---
She
 could read character sufficiently well
---
that she
 had nothing to fear from her employer's gallantry
---
Upon the whole she preferred that sentiment in man and.


---
Some women are such
 fools,. 
---
Tess felt; but
---
that she could
 not have come to a much worse place
---
Marian and Izz would have

---
that Tess meant
---
on hearing to stay, to make up
 by longer hours for her lack of skill, they would not leave her.

---
how very little of a wife she was:"
---
Izz was by nature the sauciest and most caustic of all the four girls
 who had loved Clare. 
---
"," she
 said;" but
---
I do n't think."


---
" Tess answered, with tearfulness in her words
---
I can always find out."


---
Then Tess suddenly flagged, and.


---
" I knew!"
---
when I am
 away
---
," she pleaded. 
---
," said Marian. 
---
" I've worked here
 before. 
---
Izz and I will make up
 your number."


---
" I do n't like. 
---
I'm taller than you, too."


---
However, she was so overcome. 
---
that she consented
---
She lay in a state of percipience without volition, and
---
She could hear from her corner, in addition to these noises
---
She felt certain that they were continuing
 the subject already broached, but
---
their voices were so low that she
 could not catch the words. 
---
that she felt
 better
---
, she got up and.


---
Then Izz Huett broke down. 
---
She had walked more than a dozen miles
 the previous evening,. 
---
Tess urged Izz.


---
as she
 felt better
---
Izz accepted the offer gratefully, and. 
---
Marian, as was the case
 every afternoon at this time on account of the bottle
---
" I should not have thought it of him-- never!"
---
she said in a dreamy
 tone. 
---
" And I loved him so! 
---
I did n't mind. 
---
But this
 about Izz is too bad!"


---
Tess, in her start at the words, narrowly missed.


---
she stammered.


---
Izz said,'; but
---
Do n't' ee tell her'
---
I am sure I ca n't
 help it! 
---
Izz to do
---
her to go off
 to Brazil with him
---
Tess's face faded as white as the scene without, and
---
And did Izz refuse?
---
" she asked.


---
" I do n't know. 
---
They pulled on in silence till Tess, without any premonitory
 symptoms,.


---
" Now I wish!"


---
I had n't told' ee
---
I have been living
 on in a thirtover, lackaday way, and! 
---
I ought. 
---
When Tess had reached home that evening, and
---
had entered
 into the privacy of her little white- washed chamber, she began
. 
---
But falling into doubt, she
 could not finish it. 
---
Afterwards she took the ring from the ribbon on
. 
---
which she wore it next her heart, and
---
that she was really
 the wife of this elusive lover of hers, who could propose that Izz
 should go with him abroad
---
that, how could she write entreaties to him, or
---
that she cared
 for him any more
---
her thoughts were led anew in the
 direction which they had taken more than once of late-- to the distant
 Emminster Vicarage. 
---
that she
 had been charged; and
---
if she desired
---
her having

---
to the family at the Vicarage, therefore,
 as to her own parents since her marriage, she was virtually
 non- existent. 
---
This self- effacement in both directions had been quite
 in consonance with her independent character of desiring nothing
 by way of favour or pity to which she was not entitled on a fair
 consideration of her deserts. 
---
She had set herself, and.


---
as had been established for her by the flimsy fact of
 a member of that family, in a season of impulse
---
But now that she was stung to a fever by Izz's tale
---
, there was a
 limit to her powers of renunciation. 
---
for her to make some advance
---
Surely she might summon
 the courage of solicitude,. 
---
she could

---
To leave the farm on a week- day was not in her power
---
And the distance being fifteen
 miles each way she would have to allow herself a long day for the
 undertaking by rising early.


---
A fortnight later,, she took advantage of the state of the roads to
. 
---
At four o'clock that Sunday morning she came
 downstairs and. 
---
the ground ringing under her feet like an anvil
---
Marian and Izz were much interested in her excursion,. 
---
that she should dress up in her very
 prettiest guise
---
though
 she, knowing of the austere and Calvinistic tenets of old Mr Clare,
 was indifferent, and even doubtful
---
A year had now elapsed since
 her sad marriage, but
---
she had preserved sufficient draperies from
 the wreck of her then full wardrobe; a soft
 gray woollen gown, with white crape quilling against the pink skin of
 her face and neck, and a black velvet jacket and hat.


---
"" said Izz Huett, regarding Tess
---
as she stood on

---
Izz spoke with a magnanimous abandonment of
 herself to the situation
---
; she could not be-- no woman with a heart
 bigger than a hazel- nut the influence which she exercised over those of her own sex
 being of a warmth and strength quite unusual, curiously overpowering
 the less worthy feminine feelings of spite and rivalry.


---
With a final tug and touch here, and a slight brush there, they let
 her go; and
---
she was absorbed into the pearly air of the fore- dawn.

---
They heard her footsteps tap along the hard road. 
---
as she stepped out
 to her full pace
---
Even Izz hoped, and
---
she would win
---
that she had
 been prevented
---
Still, to start on a brisk walk, and on such an errand as hers, on a
 dry clear wintry morning, through the rarefied air of these chalky
 hogs'-backs, was not depressing; and there is no doubt that her dream
 at starting was to win the heart of her mother- in- law
---
In time she reached the edge of the vast escarpment below which
 stretched the loamy Vale of Blackmoor, now lying misty and still
 in the dawn. 
---
in which she was now accustomed to
 toil
---
Instead of the great
 enclosures of a hundred acres, there were little fields below her of less than half- a- dozen
 acres, so numerous that they looked from this height like the meshes
 of a net. 
---
she did not love it as formerly
---
Beauty
 to her, as to all, lay not in the thing, but in what
 the thing symbolized.


---
Keeping the Vale on her right, she steered steadily westward;.

---
she reached Cross- in- Hand, where
 the stone pillar stands desolate and silent
---
Three miles further she cut across the
 straight and. 
---
as she reached it
---
as soon she dipped down a hill by a transverse lane
 into the small town or village of Evershead,
---
She made a halt here, and but at a cottage by the church.


---
the Sow- and- Acorn, for she avoided

---
The second half of her journey was through a more gentle country, by
 way of Benvill Lane. 
---
as the mileage lessened between her and the
 spot of her pilgrimage
---
her
 enterprise loom out more formidably. 
---
She saw her purpose in such
 staring lines, and the landscape so faintly, that she was sometimes
 in danger of losing her way. 
---
However, about noon she paused by a
 gate on the edge of the basin in which Emminster and its Vicarage
 lay.


---
beneath which she knew
---
The square tower,, had a severe look in
 her eyes. 
---
She wished. 
---
that she had somehow contrived
---
But it was incumbent upon her. 
---
She took off the thick
 boots in which she had walked thus far, put on her pretty thin ones
 of patent leather, and, stuffing the former into the hedge by the
 gatepost where she might readily find them again, descended the hill;
 the freshness of colour she had derived from the keen air thinning
 away in spite of her as she drew near the parsonage.


---
Tess hoped for some accident that might favour her, but
---
nothing
 favoured her. 
---
; she could not feel by any stretch of
 imagination, dressed to her highest as she was,.


---
She nerved herself by an effort,. 
---
Nobody answered to her ringing. 
---
She rang a second time, and
---
the
 agitation of the act, coupled with her weariness after the fifteen
 miles' walk, led her.
---
while she waited by resting
 her hand on her hip and her elbow against the wall of the porch
---
The
 wind was so nipping that the ivy- leaves had become wizened and gray,
 each tapping incessantly upon its neighbour with a disquieting stir
 of her nerves. 
---
Then she
 walked out of the porch,. 
---
though she looked dubiously at the house- front
---
And
 as if inclined to
 return, it was with a breath of relied that she closed the gate. 
---
A
 feeling haunted her, and
---
that she might have been recognized()
---
though how
 she could not tell
---
Tess went as far as the corner. 
---
She had done all she could do; but

---
, she walked back again quite past the house,.


---
She
 remembered. 
---
She
 would not make herself conspicuous by waiting on the spot, and
---
she
 started. 
---
as she reached the
 churchyard- gate
---
Tess found herself
 in the midst of them.


---
The Emminster congregation looked at her as only a congregation of
 small country- townsfolk walking home at its leisure. 
---
She
 quickened her pace, and, and
---
by which she had come
---
for them to receive her
---
She soon distanced the churchgoers, except two youngish men, who,
 linked arm- in- arm,.


---
she could hear, with the natural quickness of a woman in her
 situation noises the quality
 of her husband's tones. 
---
Forgetting all her plans, Tess's one dread was
---
lest they should
 overtake her now, in her disorganized condition,
---
before she was
 prepared to confront them
---
; for though she felt
---
that they could not
 identify her
---
, she instinctively dreaded their scrutiny. 
---
, the more briskly walked she. 
---
Only one person had preceded Tess up the hill-- a ladylike young
 woman, somewhat interesting, though, perhaps, a trifle
---
Tess had nearly overtaken her. 
---
when the speed of her
 brothers- in- law brought them so nearly behind her back that she could
 hear every word of their conversation
---
which particularly interested her till,,
---
us overtake her
---
Tess knew the name. 
---
She would have known
 as much without previous information if she had waited a moment, for

---
Whether she has

---
she had not done so some
 months ago."


---
Tess beat up the long hill still faster; but
---
she could not outwalk
 them without exciting notice. 
---
At last they outsped her altogether,
 and. 
---
Tess had paused an hour
 before that time
---
Tess's boots were appropriated.


---
She,, walked past under the screen of her woollen
 veil till,
---
presently looking back, she perceived.


---
that the church
 party had left the gate with her boots and
---
Thereupon our heroine resumed her walk. 
---
Tears, blinding tears, were
 running down her face. 
---
She knew
---
that it was all sentiment, all
 baseless impressibility, which had caused her to read the scene as
 her own condemnation
---
; nevertheless she could not get over it
---
; she
 could not contravene in her own defenceless person all those untoward
 omens. 
---
Angel's wife felt. 
---
almost as if she had been hounded up that hill like
 a scorned thing by those-- to her-- superfine clerics
---
that
 she had encountered the sons and not the father, who, despite his
 narrowness, was far less starched and ironed than they, and had to
 the full the gift of charity
---
As she again thought of her dusty
 boots
---
she almost pitied those habiliments for the quizzing to which
 they had been subjected, and.


---
she said,,"
---
that I wore those over the roughest part of the road-- no
---
Then she grieved for the beloved man whose conventional standard of
 judgement had caused her all these latter sorrows; and
---
she went her
 way without knowing that the greatest misfortune of her life was this
 feminine loss of courage at the last and critical moment through her
 estimating her father- in- law by his sons. 
---
Thereupon she began to plod back along the road by which she had come
 not altogether full of hope, but full of a conviction that a crisis
 in her life was approaching. 
---
;
 and there was nothing left for her to do but. 
---
till she could again summon courage to face the
 Vicarage
---
She did, indeed. 
---
that she could at least exhibit a face such as Mercy Chant
---
she said. 
---
Her journey back was rather a meander than a march. 
---
Along the tedious length
 of Benvill Lane she began, and she leant upon gates and
 paused by milestones.


---
She did not enter any house till, at the seventh or eighth mile
---
, she
 descended the steep long hill below which lay the village or townlet
 of Evershead, where in the morning she had breakfasted with such
 contrasting expectations. 
---
in which she
 again sat down
---
while the woman fetched her some milk from the pantry
---
, Tess, looking
 down the street, perceived.


---
", I suppose?
---
" she said.


---
" No, my dear," said the old woman. 
---
But, Lord, I do n't go to

---
for I."

 Tess soon went onward into the village,. 
---
her footsteps echoing against
 the houses
---
Nearing the
 central part, her echoes were intruded on by other sounds; and
---
seeing
 the barn not far off the road, she guessed these.


---
though she was on the closed side of
 the barn
---
Although Tess had not heard
 the beginning of the address
---
, she learnt?"



---
Tess was all the more interested,, and
---
as she stood listening behind, in
 finding that the preacher's doctrine was a vehement form of the view
 of Angel's father
---
her interest intensified. 
---
Her face fixed in painful suspense
---
, she came round
 to the front of the barn, and. 
---
But her attention
 was given to the central figure, who stood upon some sacks of corn,
. 
---
that her seducer
 confronted her
---
which had been gaining ground in Tess
---
ever since she
 had heard his words distinctly
---
XLV


 Till this moment she had never seen or.


---
that, overcame her, paralyzing her movement
---
so that she neither retreated
 nor advanced
---
when she saw it last
---
To Tess's sense there was, just at first, a ghastly_ bizarrerie_,
 a grim incongruity, in the march of these solemn words of Scripture
 out of such a mouth. 
---
This too familiar intonation, less than four
 years earlier, had brought to her ears expressions of such divergent
 purpose.


---
that her heart became quite sick at the irony of the
 contrast
---
; animalism had become fanaticism; Paganism,
 Paulinism; the bold rolling eye that had flashed upon her form in
 the old time with such mastery now beamed with the rude energy of a
 theolatry that was almost ferocious. 
---
She would admit the ungenerous sentiment no
 longer. 
---
why should she
 deem it unnatural in him? 
---
It was but the usage of thought which had
 been jarred in her at hearing good new words in bad old notes. 
---
Such impressions as these moved her vaguely, and without strict
 definiteness. 
---
as the nerveless pause of her surprise would
 allow
---
her to stir
---
As soon, her impulse was. 
---
that she moved again
---
as she
 faced him
---
; for Tess's energies returned with the atrophy of
 his, and
---
she walked as fast as she was able past the barn and onward.


---
as she could reflect
---
As soon, it appalled her, this change in their
 relative platforms. 
---
who had wrought her undoing
---
while she remained unregenerate
---
She went on without turning her head. 
---
Her back seemed
---
to be endowed
 with a sensitiveness to ocular beams-- even her clothing-- so alive
 was she to a fancied gaze which might be resting upon her from the
 outside of that barn. 
---
All the way along to this point her heart
 had been heavy with an inactive sorrow
---
That hunger for affection too long
 withheld was for the time displaced by an almost physical sense
 of an implacable past which still engirdled her. 
---
It intensified
 her consciousness of error to a practical despair; the break of
 continuity between her earlier and present existence, which she had
 hoped for. 
---
till she was a bygone herself
---
Thus absorbed, she recrossed the northern part of Long- Ash Lane at
 right angles, and.

---
along whose margin the remainder of her journey lay
---
Tess became conscious of footsteps behind her, and

---
she saw
---
the one personage in all the world she
 wished
---
she
 yielded as calmly as she could to the necessity of letting him
 overtake her. 
---
She saw.


---
She slackened speed without looking round.


---
She then looked back at him, and
---
"," she answered coldly.


---
Yet I deserve no more! 
---
But-- I must put up with that.... 
---
I
 heard
---
why I
 have followed you
---
" I do, rather; and
---
I would with all my heart!"


---
" But do n't mistake me; I beg
 this. 
---
immediately afterwards I
 felt that of all persons in the world whom it was my duty and desire
 to save from the wrath to come
---
whom I
 had so grievously wronged
---
the woman was that person
---
I have come with that
 sole purpose in view-- nothing more."


---
There was the smallest vein of scorn in her words of rejoinder
---
"

"_ I_ have done nothing!"
---
"," she said.


---
that I was,
---
I, wretched fellow insulted
 him. 
---
But the loss of my
 mother hit me most; and
---
she cried passionately,. 
---
as she turned away
 from him to a stile by the wayside, on which she bent herself
---
" Tess" do n't speak so! 
---
She dropped her voice. 
---
" Yes," she replied sadly. 
---
" But I can not believe in your conversion
 to a new spirit. 
---
Alec, I fear!"


---
Thus speaking she turned from the stile over which she had been
 leaning, and faced him
---
who had been quite unconscious of her action and mien
---
Tess,,
 instantly withdrew the large dark gaze of her eyes,
---
And there was revived in her the
 wretched sentiment which had often come to her before, that in
 inhabiting the fleshly tabernacle with which Nature had endowed her
 she was somehow doing wrong.


---
She pulled down the veil,.
---
" Ssh!" said Tess.


---
" Well, women's faces have had too much power over me already for me
! 
---
then, Tess inwardly wondering.

---
she
 asked him. 
---
" I think
---
I must leave you now
---
" I have,
 and
---
I must go away and

---
" I have learnt things in my troubles
---
," she said evasively.


---
She told him of the first one-- the only one that related to him.


---
" I knew nothing of this till now!"

---
She did not reply; and
---
" No," she answered. 
---
" I will think. 
---
I fear you at moments-- far more than you need fear me at present; and
."


---
Tess, half frightened, gave way to his importunity
---
" I am sorry you are not a believer
---
At home at least I can pray for you; and
---
I will; and
? 
---
I'm off.
---
She meanwhile had kept along the edge of the hill by which lay her
 nearest way home. 
---
Within the distance of a mile she met a solitary
 shepherd.


---
she asked of
 him. 
---
She felt the_ petite mort_ at this unexpectedly gruesome information,
 and. 
---
when she drew near
 to Flintcomb- Ash
---
in the lane at the entrance to the hamlet she
 approached a girl and her lover without their observing her. 
---
For a
 moment the voices cheered the heart of Tess,. 
---
till she reasoned
---
that
 this interview had its origin, on one side or the other, in the same
 attraction which had been the prelude to her own tribulation
---
When
 she came close
---
, the girl turned serenely and. 
---
The woman was Izz Huett,
 whose interest in Tess's excursion immediately superseded her own
 proceedings. 
---
Tess did not explain very clearly its results, and Izz,
 who was a girl of tact,, a
 phase of which Tess had just witnessed.


---
," she explained indifferently. 
---
that I had come here
---
XLVI


 Several days had passed since her futile journey, and
---
Tess was
 afield. 
---
Tess was standing at the
 uncovered end,.

---
from its trough
 came the newly- cut swedes, the fresh smell of whose yellow chips
 was accompanied by the sounds of the snuffling wind, the smart swish
 of the slicing- blades, and the choppings of the hook in Tess's
 leather- gloved hand.


---
Tess,,
 did not perceive him.


---
It was not her hard taskmaster, Farmer Groby
---
A pale distress was already on
 Tess's face, and
---
she pulled her curtained hood further over it.


---
said she.


---
" Yes, but I have a good reason."


---
" In
 thinking of your soul and mine, I neglected to
 inquire as to your worldly condition. 
---
I
 did not think of it. 
---
But I see now. 
---
when I-- knew you-- harder than you deserve
---
She did not answer, and
---
, her face completely screened by the hood
---
, she resumed her

---
By going on with her work she felt better
 able to keep him outside her emotions.


---
" Tess was the very
 worst case I ever was concerned in! 
---
I had no idea of what had
 resulted till you told me. 
---
that I was
---
of which I am

---
I say in all earnestness."


---
parents to bring up their girls in such dangerous ignorance of the
 gins and nets that the wicked may set for them,
---
Tess still did no more than listen, throwing down one globular root
 and taking up another with automatic regularity, the pensive contour
 of the mere fieldwoman alone marking her.


---
that I came
---
I have lost my mother, and
---
But I intend, and

---
I shall make at the trade, no doubt. 
---
I want
---
I can make for the trick
---
that is, will you be
 my wife, and
---
I have already obtained this precious
 document. 
---
It was my old mother's dying wish."


---
" said she.


---
" O no, sir-- no!" she said quickly,.


---
Tess, too, felt.

---
with whom she
 wished
---
Informing the man to see her, to walk a little way, she moved off with d'Urberville across
 the zebra- striped field. 
---
she stepped
 forward on the summits of the earth- rolls.


---
as if she did not see him
---
she pleaded. 
---
she said proudly. 
---
" I should think not!"


---
I do not wish
---
" she begged, and.


---
Well, that being so," he added, quite
 calmly, tearing the licence slowly into halves and putting them in
 his pocket;" that being prevented, I should like.  Though, if I could know your husband, I
 might more easily benefit him and you. " No," she murmured. 
---
she cried,. 
---
You are a deserted wife,
---
to take her hand; the buff- glove was
 on it, and
---
" she cried fearfully,. 
---
Tess, as
 God is my judge, I meant no humbug in taking your hand a voice
 reached her ear:

" What the devil are you doing away from your work at this time o'
 day?"


---
She went close up to him.


---
she said.


---
I can see in his face what a
 churl he is."


---
I can leave at
 Lady- Day.
---
" Well, I have no right but to obey
---
, I suppose. 
---
whom she dreaded more than her assailant,
---
who would
 have cuffed her
---
She silently walked back towards the summit of the
 field that was the scene of her labour, so.


---
that she was hardly aware that the nose of
 Groby's horse almost touched her shoulders
---
, I'll
 see
---
"' Od rot the women-- now
' tis one thing, and
---
But I'll put up with it no
 longer!"


---
Knowing very well, she did for one moment picture. 
---
if she had been free to accept the offer
---
It would have lifted her completely
 out of subjection, not only to her present oppressive employer, but
 to a whole world who seemed to despise her. 
---
she said
 breathlessly;"
---
I could not have married him now! 
---
That very night she began an appealing letter to Clare,.

---
But again she did not finish her effusion
---
She put the letter in her box, and.


---
After this her daily tasks were gone through heavily enough, and

---
Though Tess also meant
---
to leave at the
 quarter- day, she was one of the few who did not go to the fair,
.


---
She had

---
wherein she was a lodger,
---
which she had all to
 herself to- day
---
Tess jumped up, but
---
her visitor had knocked at the door, and she
 could hardly in reason run away. 
---
when she last saw him
---
She thought; but
---
that she would not open the door
---
, as
 there was no sense in that either, she arose, and having lifted the
 latch stepped back quickly. 
---
that a good
 woman should do to a bad man
---
yet
 Tess did not pity him.


---
," she said,"
---
when I am forbidden
---
I have been cured of the presumption of thinking otherwise.
---
" By my husband, if I must tell."


---
I remember

---
Here she gave her negations.


---
That's just like you
 women. 
---
" Ah,!" said she, with a triumphant
 simplicity of faith in Angel Clare that the most perfect man could
 hardly have deserved, much less her husband.


---
But I looked at it in this way
---
what I might believe,
---
She reflected; and
---
even when she did not comprehend their spirit
---
with her acute memory for the letter of Angel
 Clare's remarks,, she
 recalled a merciless polemical syllogism that she had heard him
 use when, as it occasionally happened, he indulged in a species of
 thinking aloud with her at his side. 
---
In delivering it she gave also
 Clare's accent and manner with reverential faithfulness.


---
She repeated the argument, and
---
she gave another,
 which might possibly have been paralleled in many a work of the
 pedigree ranging from the_ Dictionnaire Philosophique_ to Huxley's

---
," she resumed. 
---
said Tess,.


---
" I can not get there! 
---
I have come here.
---
I shall not be there-- by reason of my
 burning desire to see a woman whom I once despised!--No, by my word
 and truth
---
, I never despised you;!

---
if I had
---
I should not love you now
---
Why I did not despise
---
you are she. 
---
I thought, but
---
I
 worshipped on the mountains
---
I find!

---
I still serve in the groves
---
What have I done!"


---
if she were a child
---
said Tess,.


---
I know it
---
"-- I repeat. 
---
that I do not blame you
---
When I saw
---
that day I was nearly mad to

---
that I had no legal right to protect you
---
-- that I could not have
 it;
---
she cried in much
 excitement. 
---
I will
---
-- I will
---
Tess had let into the sea of his enthusiasm

---
When Izz Huett and Tess arrived at the scene of operations only a
 rustling denoted that others had preceded them;
---
while this was in progress Izz and Tess, with the
 other women- workers, in their whitey- brown pinners
---
that the women had come
---
, the women mounted, and
---
her business being
---
handed on to her
 by Izz Huett, who stood next
---
It was the ceaselessness
 of the work which tried her so severely, and. 
---
that she had never some to Flintcomb- Ash
---
The women on the
 corn- rick-- Marian,, in particular-- could stop to
 drink ale or cold tea from the flagon now and then, or to exchange
 a few gossiping remarks while they wiped their faces or cleared the
 fragments of straw and husk from their clothing; but
---
for Tess there
 was no respite and
---
she, to supply the man with untied
 sheaves, could not stop either,.


---
unless Marian changed places with
 her,
---
which she sometimes did for half an hour in spite of Groby's
 objections that she was too slow- handed for a feeder
---
For some probably economical reason it was usually a woman who was
 chosen for this particular duty, and
---
that she was one of those who best combined strength
 with quickness in untying, and both with staying power
---
As Tess and the man could never turn their
 heads
---
she did not know
---
" said Izz Huett to Marian. 
---
She had at first addressed
 the inquiry to Tess, but
---
" Somebody's fancy- man, I s'pose
---
," said Marian laconically.


---
" I'll lay a guinea he's after Tess."


---
who's been sniffing after her lately
---
Then I'll tell her
---
She'll see him soon enough, good- now.
---
" Well, I do n't think it at all right for him to join his preaching to
 courting a married woman,, and
 she, in a sense, a widow."


---
even though her husband mid be abroad
---
," said Izz drily. 
---
" Her mind can no more
 be heaved from that one place where it do bide than a stooded waggon
 from the hole he's in. 
---
that she should be weaned
---
; whereupon Tess left her
 post,.


---
her knees trembling so wretchedly with the shaking of the
 machine that she could scarcely walk
---
as I've done
---
to het a quart o' drink into' ee,," said
 Marian. 
---
It occurred to the good- natured Marian; and
---
as Tess was so tired
---
that,,
 her discovery of her visitor's presence might have the bad effect of
 taking away her appetite
---
Marian was thinking of inducing Tess
 to descend by a ladder on the further side of the stack when the
 gentleman came forward and looked up.


---
Tess uttered a short little" Oh!"  And a moment after she said,
 quickly
---
," I shall eat my dinner here-- right on the rick."


---
where she was
---
Having decided
 to remain, Tess sat down among the bundles, out of
 sight of the ground, and. 
---
till, by- and- by, she heard
 footsteps on the ladder, and immediately after Alec appeared upon the
 stack-- now an oblong and level platform of sheaves
---
Tess continued. 
---
which she had brought with her
---
I am here again,
---
she cried, reproach flashing from her
 very finger- ends.


---
She gazed in silence.


---
" she asked. 
---
She
 had gathered from Angel sufficient of the incredulity of modern
; but,.


---
as a woman, she was
 somewhat appalled
---
I have broken every engagement since that afternoon
---
I was
. 
---
what I am thought of by the brethren
---
But what do I care? 
---
How could I go on with the thing
?--
---
when I had lost my faith in it
---
Among them I should have stood like Hymenaeus and
 Alexander, who were delivered over to Satan. 
---
I saw you
 innocent, and
---
I deceived you. 
---
as I used
---
But Tess, my coz, to call you, this is only
 my way of talking, and
---
I saw it on the rick-- that tight
 pinafore- thing sets it off, and that wing- bonnet-- you field- girls
 should never wear those bonnets if you wish to keep out of danger."

---
I believe
---
whose deputy
 I thought
---
I was
---
as I do
---
Tess attempted, but at this juncture all her fluency
 failed her, and without heeding he added:

" Well, this paradise that you supply is perhaps as good as any other,
 after all. 
---
Since I last saw you
---
", I have been thinking of what
 you said that HE said. 
---
I have come to the conclusion that there
 does seem rather a want of common- sense in these threadbare old
 propositions;
---
how I could have been so fired by poor Parson Clare's
 enthusiasm, and
---
I
 can not make out! 
---
She tried, and. 
---
her being a
 vessel of emotions rather than reasons
---
But owing to Angel Clare's
 reticence, to her absolute want of training, and to, she could not get on.


---
she entreated. 
---
Tess, I am more taken with you than ever, and
---
She could not get her morsels of food down her throat
---
; her lips
 were dry, and
---
she was ready to choke. 
---
The voices and laughs of the
 workfolk eating and drinking under the rick came to her.


---
I pity you too.
 For all your closeness, I see."

"" she said. 
---
Tess?--'And she shall follow after her lover,
 but
---
she shall not overtake him; and
---
she shall seek him, but
---
; then shall she say,
---
Tess, my trap
 is waiting just under the hill, and-- darling mine, not his!--you know
 the rest."


---
Her face had been rising to a dull crimson fire; but

---
she did not answer.


---
which she had taken off
---
One of her leather gloves, to eat her
 skimmer- cake, lay in her lap, and
---
without the slightest warning she
 passionately swung the glove by the gauntlet directly in his face.

---
Fancy might have regarded the act as the recrudescence of
 a trick in which her armed progenitors were not unpractised. 
---
where her blow had alighted
---
She too had sprung up, but
---
she sank down again."
---
she
 said,. 
---
I shall not cry
 out. 
---
so that she shook
 under his grasp
---
her go
---
She had not spoken again,. 
---
amid
 the renewed rustle of the straw Tess resumed her position by the
 buzzing drum as one in a dream,.




---
that Tess raised
 her eyes and
---
She felt but little
 surprise at seeing that Alec d'Urberville had come back, and was
 standing under the hedge by the gate. 
---
her lift her
 eyes
---
Tess looked down again, and

---
Tess could see. 
---
She still stood at her post,
---
her flushed and face, and
---
her white bonnet embrowned by it.

---
She was the only woman whose place was upon the machine so as to be
 and
---
the decrease of the stack now
 separated her from Marian and Izz, and. 
---
which every fibre of her frame participated
---
The incessant quivering, in
, had thrown her into a
 stupefied reverie in which her arms worked on independently of her
 consciousness. 
---
She hardly knew, and.


---
where she was
---
Izz
 Huett tell her from below
---
that her hair was tumbling down
---
Whenever Tess lifted her head
---
she beheld always the
 great upgrown straw- stack, with the men in shirt- sleeves upon it,
 against the gray north sky; in front of it the long red elevator
 like a Jacob's ladder, on which a perpetual stream of threshed straw
 ascended, a yellow river running uphill, and spouting out on the top
 of the rick.


---
She knew. 
---
though she could not say where
---
For the
 last hour or two Marian had felt uneasy about Tess, whom she could
 not get near enough to speak to,, and
---
the other women having kept up their
 strength by drinking ale
---
Tess having done without it through
 traditionary dread,.

---
But Tess still kept
---
if she could not fill her part
---
she would
 have; and
---
which she would have regarded
 with equanimity and even with relief a month or two earlier
---
To Tess's surprise Farmer
 Groby came up on the machine to her, and. 
---
if she desired to

---
her to keep on any longer
---
she knew, and
---
She shook her head and
.


---
being now uncovered
 from their last refuge, they ran across the open ground in all
 directions, a loud shriek from the by- this- time half- tipsy Marian
 informing her companions that one of the rats had invaded her
 person-- a terror which the rest of the women had guarded against by
 various schemes of skirt- tucking and self- elevation. 
---
The rat was
 at last dislodged, and, amid the barking of dogs, masculine shouts,
 feminine screams, oaths, stampings, and confusion as of Pandemonium,
 Tess untied her last sheaf; the drum slowed, the whizzing ceased,
 and she stepped from the machine to the ground.


---
Her lover,, was promptly
 at her side.


---
" What-- after all-- my insulting slap, too!" said she in an
 underbreath. 
---
She was so utterly exhausted that she had not strength
 to speak louder.


---
" O yes," she answered with a jaded gait. 
---
I do bear in mind. 
---
than I
 have been thinking
---
I am
 grateful for
---
I can not sense your meaning sometimes.
---
If I can not legitimize our former relations at least
---
" I can assist
 you. 
---
And I will do it with much more regard for your feelings than
 I formerly showed. 
---
But I retain a little good nature
---
; I hope. 
---
I do
---
Now, Tess, by
 all, trust me! 
---
I
 have enough and more than enough, both
 for yourself and your parents and sisters. 
---
I can make them all
 comfortable.
---
" she quickly inquired.


---
The cold moon looked aslant upon Tess's fagged face between the twigs
 of the garden- hedge,.


---
as she paused outside the cottage which was her
 temporary home
---
she said. 
---
she cried. 
---
" I will
 take nothing from you, either for them or for me!"


---
as she lived with the
 household
---
No sooner had she herself
 entered, a passionate
 mood--


    MY OWN HUSBAND,--

   
---
than she fell into thought
---
-- I must--
---
I must cry to you
    in my trouble
---
-- I have no one else! 
---
I am so exposed to
    temptation, Angel. 
---
I fear, and
---
I do not
   
---
But I cling to you in a way
    you can not think! 
---
O, I know,
   ! 
---
I think. 
---
I must die
---
-- I do know that--
   
---
even if I do not deserve it, and
---
, I could die in your arms! 
---
I would
    be well content to do that if so be you had forgiven me!

   
---
Angel, I live entirely for you. 
---
I love you too much to
   
---
I know. 
---
I shall say a word of
    sting or bitterness
---
I am desolate
    without you, my darling, O, so desolate!
---
I do not mind
   : but
---
I am coming soon
---
say,"," I will bide on, Angel-- O, so
    cheerfully!

   
---
before I am aware
---
I am the same women,
    Angel,;
---
I
    became another woman,. 
---
How
    could I be the early one? 
---
How silly I was in my happiness! 
---
when I thought
---
I could trust
    you always
---
I ought. 
---
But I am sick at heart, not only
    for old times, but for the present. 
---
if I could
   
---
that I am rather pretty
---
since I wish
---
Perhaps I
    am. 
---
But I do not value my good looks
---
; I only
    like. 
---
So much have I felt this,. 
---
when I met with
    annoyance on account of the same
---
that, I tied up my face in a
    bandage as long as people would believe in it
---
O Angel, I
    tell you all this not from vanity--!

   
---
I do not
---
I am,, worried,. 
---
as I say
---
what I will
    not do
---
that I shall yield one inch
---
I am
    in terror as to what an accident might lead to, and I so
    defenceless on account of my first error.
---
I can not say more
    about this
---
if I break down
    by falling into some fearful snare
---
O God, I can not think of it! 
---
I would be content, ay, glad,,
---
if I may not as your wife
---
to live with you as your
    servant; so that I could only be
    near you, and.

   
---
I do n't like,. 
---
because I grieve and grieve to miss you who used to
   
---
where the air is so soft and
 the soil so rich that the effort of growth requires but superficial
 aid by comparison with the tillage at Flintcomb- Ash, and where to
 Tess
---
that she had been requested by
 Angel
---
And she did not vent this
 often
---
; for she was as considerate as she was devout, and.

---
Only too often had she heard. 
---
that she
 was with her relatives, and
---
for which Tess's letter was intended
---
would die; the mother would pause
.


---
Still more
 pertinently, who was the moral woman? 
---
This growing fondness for her memory coincided in point of time
 with her residence at Flintcomb- Ash, but
---
before she had felt
 herself at liberty
---
Thus
 her silence of docility was misinterpreted. 
---
understood!--that she adhered with literal exactness to
 orders which he had given and forgotten
---
; that despite her natural
 fearlessness she asserted no rights,.


---
what Tess had been
---
that was of no importance beside what she
 would be, and
---
if she loved him
---
she had replied in the affirmative. 
---
Did she love him more than
 Tess did? 
---
No, she had replied
---
; Tess would lay down her life for him,
 and
---
she herself could do no more.


---
as she had appeared on the day of the wedding
---
; how she had hung upon his words
! 
---
In
 the latter aspect her d'Urberville descent was a fact of great
 dimensions; worthless to economics
---
It was a
 fact that would soon be forgotten-- that bit of distinction in poor
 Tess's blood and name, and
---
oblivion would fall upon her hereditary
 link with the marble monuments and leaded skeletons at Kingsbere. 
---
what still abode in such a woman as

---
Despite her not- inviolate past, Tess outvalued the freshness of her fellows. 
---
that the facts of her life had
 not changed
---
if her presence had not
 attenuated them
---
that,, her absence could not
---
Nevertheless she addressed
 her mind to the tender question of what she could do to please him
 best if he should arrive. 
---
that she
 had inquired more curiously of him
---
She indirectly inquired of Amby
 Seedling, who had followed Izz from Talbothays, and by chance Amby
 remembered that, amongst the snatches of melody in which they had
 indulged at the dairyman's, to induce the cows to let down their
 milk, Clare had seemed to like" Cupid's Gardens"," I have parks, I
 have hounds", and" The break o' the day"; and had seemed not to care
 for" The Tailor's Breeches" and" Such a beauty I did grow", excellent
 ditties as they were.


---
To perfect the ballads was now her whimsical desire.
---
She practised
 them privately at odd moments, especially" The break o' the day":


    Arise, arise, arise!
   
---
her singing these

---
whenever she worked apart from the rest of the girls in this
 cold dry time
---
to hear ditties; the tears running down her cheeks all the while at the
 thought the simple silly words of the songs resounding in painful mockery of
 the aching heart of the singer.


---
Tess was so wrapt up in this fanciful dream that she seemed not to

---
would soon be followed by Old Lady- Day, the
 end of her term here
---
Tess think of far different matters
---
She was at her lodging as
 usual one evening,.

---
Through the doorway she saw against the declining light a figure
 with the height of a woman and the breadth of a child, a tall, thin,
 girlish creature whom she did not recognize in the twilight!"


---
till the
 girl said" Tess
---
whom a little over a year ago she had left at home as a child
---
Her sister,
, had
 sprung up by a sudden shoot to a form of this presentation, of which
 as yet
---
Lu seemed herself scarce able to understand the meaning.

---
Her thin legs, visible below her once- long frock, now short by her
 growing, and her uncomfortable hands and arms revealed her youth and
 inexperience.


---
" Yes, I have been traipsing about all day
---
" Mother is took very bad, and
---
she's dying
---
Tess stood in reverie a long time. 
---
before she thought of asking
' Liza- Lu to come in and sit down
---
When she had done so, and
---
, she came to a decision. 
---
that
 she should go home
---
Her agreement did not end till Old Lady- Day, the
 sixth of April, but
---
as the interval thereto was not a long one she
 resolved to run the risk of starting at once.


---
her sister
 was too tired to undertake such a distance till the morrow. 
---
Tess
 ran down to where Marian and Izz lived,.

---
Returning, she got Lu a supper, and
---
L


 She plunged into the chilly equinoctial darkness. 
---
as the clock struck
 ten, for her fifteen miles' walk under the steely stars
---
knowing this, Tess pursued the nearest course along
 by- lanes; but

---
that she would almost have feared in the day- time
---
spectral fears were driven out of
 her mind by thoughts of her mother. 
---
Thus she proceeded mile after
 mile,, and
---
till she came to Bulbarrow
---
about
 midnight looked from that height into the abyss of chaotic shade
 which was all that revealed itself of the vale on whose further side
 she was born. 
---
Having already traversed about five miles on the
 upland, she had now some ten or eleven in the lowland. 
---
before her
 journey would be finished
---
The winding road downwards became just
 visible to her under the wan starlight, and

---
as she followed it
---
soon she paced a soil. 
---
At Nuttlebury she passed the village inn, whose sign creaked in
 response to the greeting of her footsteps, which not a human soul
 heard but herself. 
---
Under the thatched roofs her mind's eye beheld
 relaxed tendons and flaccid muscles, spread out in the darkness
 beneath coverlets made of little purple patchwork squares, and
.


---
At three she turned the last corner of the maze of lanes
---
she had

---
she had first seen Angel Clare,
---
threaded, and entered Marlott, passing the field in which as a
 club- girl; the sense of disappointment remained with her yet. 
---
In the
 direction of her mother's house she saw a light. 
---
it wink at
 her
---
as she could discern the outline of the house
---
As soon-- newly
 thatched with her money-- it had all its old effect upon Tess's
 imagination. 
---
; the
 slope of its dormers, the finish of its gables, the broken courses of
 brick, all had something in common with her
 personal character. 
---
A stupefaction had come into these features, to
 her regard
---
; it meant the illness of her mother.


---
She opened the door so softly;
---
who was sitting up with her mother
---
though she was sleeping just then
---
Tess prepared herself a
 breakfast, and.


---
when she contemplated the children
---
although she had been away little more than
 a year
---
the necessity of applying
 herself heart and soul to their needs took her out of her own cares.


---
Tess asked him.


---
" I'm thinking of sending round to all the old antiqueerians in this
 part of England. 
---
Tess postponed her arguments on this high project. 
---
till she had
 grappled with pressing matters in hand, which seemed little improved
 by her remittances
---
, she
 turned her attention to external things. 
---
She found, to her
 dismay,. 
---
At the earliest
 moment she obtained, and
---
what others she could procure
---
while she herself undertook the allotment- plot
 which they rented in a field a couple of hundred yards out of the
 village
---
She liked doing it after the confinement of the sick chamber, where
 she was not now required by reason of her mother's improvement.

---
One fine day Tess and' Liza- Lu worked on here with their neighbours
 till the last rays of the sun smote flat upon the white pegs. 
---
Tess being among them,
---
though she sent her sister home
---
It was
 on one of the couch- burning plots that she laboured with her fork,
 its four shining prongs resounding against the stones and dry clods
 in little clicks. 
---
Sometimes she was completely involved in the smoke
 of her fire; then it would leave her figure free,. 
---
She was
---
her attire being a gown bleached
 by many washings, with a short black jacket over it, the effect of
 the whole being that of a wedding and funeral guest in one
---
The
 women further back wore white aprons, which, with their pale faces,
 were all that could be seen of them in the gloom, except when at
 moments they caught a flash from the flames.


---
as Tess
 stirred the clods and now a hope that Clare would ever hear them
---
who worked nearest to her
---
who, she found
---
whom she supposed.

---
She became more conscious of him. 
---
Tess did not speak to her fellow- worker, nor
---
Nor did she think of him further than to recollect that he had not
 been there when it was broad daylight, and
---
that she did not know
 him as any one of the Marlott labourers, which was no wonder
---
, her
 absences having been so long and frequent of late years. 
---
On
 going up to the fire to throw a pitch of dead weeds upon it, she
 found.
---
she beheld the face of d'Urberville.


---
" she weakly asked.


---
I
 am
---
I used. 
---
when I was
 theological
---
, I can bring thee thither soon.'
   
---
My dear Tess, I am only putting this to you as a thing
 that you might have supposed or said quite untruly,."


---
She could not bear the humiliating reminder.


---
she said bitterly. 
---
" I have no husband!"


---
I have determined.

---
what I have sent there
 for you
---
" O, Alec, I wish! 
---
I can not take
 it from you! 
---
I do n't like--
---
" I am not going."


---
whom
 I feel so tenderly
---
as I do for you in trouble without trying to

---
" But I am very well off! 
---
I am only in trouble about-- about-- not
 about living at all!"


---
She turned, and.


---
" I've
 been thinking of them."


---
Tess's heart quivered
---
Since returning home her soul had gone
 out to those children with an affection that was passionate.


---
If your mother does not recover
---
to do something for
 them;, I suppose?
---
I've undeceived him."


---
Tess could not get on with her digging after this
---
; she felt restless
---
;
 she wondered.


---
Some twenty yards from the house she was met by one of her sisters.


---
mother is a good deal better, but
---
who was there for mother

---
When Tess's mother was a child the majority of the field- folk about
 Marlott
---
which had cast such a shadow over
 Tess's life, the Durbeyfield family( whose descent was not credited)

---
Widow Joan,
 her daughters Tess and' Liza- Lu, the boy Abraham, and the younger
 children had.


---
Tess was keeping house till they should
 return.


---
She was kneeling in the window- bench, her face close to the casement,
 where an outer pane of rain- water was sliding down the inner pane of
 glass. 
---
Her eyes rested on the web of a spider,.

---
Tess was reflecting on the position of the household, in which she
 perceived her own evil influence. 
---
Had she not come home, her mother
 and the children. 
---
But she had been observed almost immediately on her

---
that she was living here again
---
; her mother was scolded
 for" harbouring" her
---
; sharp retorts had ensued from Joan, who had
 independently offered to leave at once
---
; she had been taken at her
 word; and
---
" I ought
---
never to have come home," said Tess to herself, bitterly.


---
She was so intent upon these thoughts that she hardly at first took
 note of a man in a white mackintosh whom she saw riding down the
 street. 
---
Possibly it was owing to her face being near to the pane
. 
---
that she observed him
---
she opened the casement in obedience to his gesture.


---
I was not attending
---
"," she said. 
---
" I heard you.
---
, I believe,
---
though I
 fancied
---
I was in a sort of dream."


---
,
 I suppose?
---
" I ought
---
not to tell you either,
 I suppose. 
---
As for me, I'm a sham one
---
she killed
 him
---
Mother is so foolish about
 father's people that she will go there."


---
" But your mother's family are not fit for lodgings, and in a little
 hole of a town like that. 
---
There are hardly any poultry now, since my mother's
 death; but
---
your mother can live there quite
 comfortably; and
---
she declared.

---
your mother can attend to them
 excellently; and
---
Tess breathed more and more quickly, and
---
at length she said--

? 
---
my mother would be-- homeless
 again
---
Tess shook her head. 
---
; she had seldom seen
 him so determined
---
" It is
 her business to judge-- not yours. 
---
Tess again shook her head, her throat swelling with complicated
 emotion. 
---
She could not look up at d'Urberville
---
your mother's goods unloading
---
With stormy eyes she pulled
 the stay- bar quickly, and
---
" she cried.


---
d'Urberville.

 Tess remained
---
where she was a long while,
---
the region of her eyes to swell with the
 rush of hot tears thither
---
She had

---
Never
 in her life-- she could swear it from the bottom of her soul--
---
she ever intended
---
Whatever her sins, they were not sins of intention, but of
 inadvertence, and why should she have been punished so persistently?


---
She passionately seized the first piece of paper that came to hand,
 and
---
T.

 She watched.


---
The two
 biggest of the younger children had gone out with their mother
---
Tess at length joined them, without
 lighting a candle.


---
", dears, in the house
," she said quickly. 
---
she had

---
Tess changed the subject.


---
" Sing to me, dears," she said.


---
" Anything; I do n't mind."


---
Tess turned from them, and. 
---
she put her face to the pane as though to
 peer into the gloom. 
---
If she could
 only believe
---
if she were only sure
---
; how confidently she would leave them
 to Providence and their future kingdom! 
---
But, in default of that, it
 behoved her;
---
to do something to be their Providence; for to Tess,
 as to not a few millions of others, there was ghastly satire in the
 poet's lines--


                       Not in utter nakedness
      But
---
To her and her like, birth itself was an ordeal of degrading personal
 compulsion, whose gratuitousness nothing in the result seemed to
 justify, and at best could only palliate.


---
In the shades of the wet road she soon discerned her mother with tall
' Liza- Lu and Abraham. 
---
Tess opened it.


---
I see the tracks of a horse outside the window
---
"," said Joan. 
---
" No," said Tess.


---
The children by the fire looked gravely at her, and
---
"," said Tess. 
---
," answered Tess in stony hopelessness.


---
" said Joan curiously.


---
" I will tell you."


---
, she had said. 
---
They were only women
---
It was a relief to Tess,. 
---
when she looked out of the window
---
Her mother,' Liza- Lu, and Abraham were also awake, but
---
at
 length, about two o'clock, the whole was under way, the cooking- pot
 swinging from the axle of the waggon, Mrs Durbeyfield and family
 at the top, the matron having in her lap, to prevent injury to its
 works, the head of the clock, which, at any exceptional lurch of the
 waggon, struck one, or one- and- a- half, in hurt tones. 
---
Tess and the
 next eldest girl walked alongside.


---
During the halt Tess's eyes fell upon a three- pint blue mug, which
 was ascending and descending through the air to and from the feminine
 section of a household,. 
---
She followed one of
 the mug's journeys upward, and. 
---
to be clasped by hands
 whose owner she well knew
---
Tess went towards the waggon.


---
she cried to the girls,. 
---
Tess told them hers.


---
Tess murmured. 
---
She bade her acquaintance goodbye--
---
on which Mrs
 Durbeyfield and her family rode was a creaking erection that would
 scarcely bear the weight of the superincumbent load
---
Tess looked around. 
---
She nodded. 
---
Her mother looked hopelessly at fault. 
---
she said bitterly. 
---
Tess
 remaining with the waggon
---
when her search for accommodation had
 still been fruitless
---
At the last return of Joan to
 the vehicle, an hour later,, the driver of the waggon said the goods must be
 unloaded, as the horses were half- dead, and
---
" Very well-- unload it here," said Joan recklessly. 
---
" I'll get shelter
 somewhere."


---
, she paid him,, and
---
Tess gazed desperately at the pile of furniture. 
---
vault your own freehold" said Tess's mother,. 
---
as
 she returned from a reconnoitre of the church and graveyard
---
Tess listlessly lent a hand, and
---
Joan drew the curtains round the bed. 
---
"," she said. 
---
, she again ascended the little
 lane which secluded the church from the townlet. 
---
" Where is Tess?
---
Personally Joan had no liking for Alec. 
---
She cursorily signified the
 direction of the church, and. 
---
just then, she walked about the
 churchyard,.

---
she entered it for the
 first time in her life.


---
that she had ever received
---
that her people were socially extinct
---
She drew near to a dark stone on which was inscribed:


    OSTIUM SEPULCHRI ANTIQUAE FAMILIAE D'URBERVILLE


 Tess did not read Church- Latin like a Cardinal, but she knew that
 this was the door of her ancestral sepulchre, and that the tall
 knights of whom her father had chanted in his cups lay inside.


---
She musingly turned,. 
---
In the dusk she
 had not noticed it before, and
---
as she drew close
 to it
---
As soon she discovered all in a moment; and
---
the shock to her sense of not having been alone was so
 violent.


---
that she was quite overcome, and
---
till she had recognized Alec d'Urberville in the form
---
she murmured.


---
she bent down upon the entrance to the vaults, and

---
In the meantime Marian and Izz Huett had journeyed onward with the
 chattels of the ploughman in the direction of their land of Canaan--
 the Egypt of some other family who had left it only that morning.

---
," said Marian. 
---
she's put to, and what's hovering round
---
though they had learnt nothing more of
 Tess
---
SIR--

    Look to your Wife
---
if you do love her as much as she do
   
---
For she is sore put to by an Enemy in the shape
    of a Friend. 
---
Sir, there is one near her who ought to be
    Away. 
---
A woman should not be try'd beyond her Strength,
    and continual dropping.

   
---
What woman,
 indeed, among the most faithful adherents of the truth, believes the
 promises and threats of the Word in the sense in which she believes
 in her own children, or would not throw her theology to the wind if
 weighed against their happiness? 
---
she cried
 in all the irony of sorrow,.


---
as she turned herself aside
---
" It was from your wife
---
" Perhaps
 she will never be reconciled to me!"


---
said
 his mother.


---
I wish

---
she were so in the sense you mean; but.'
---
what
 I have never explained before,
---
such that though, while on the south of
 the Equator and just in receipt of her loving epistle, it had seemed
 the easiest thing in the world to rush back into her arms the moment
 he chose to forgive her, now that he had arrived
---
She was passionate, and
---
her present letter,
 showing.

---
that her love had indeed turned
---
when she will
    return
---
J will let as Soon as she do.
   
---
Where she is
   
---
that Tess was at least
 apparently well that her mother's stiff reticence as to her
 whereabouts did not long distress him
---
there was no sign of Joan's letter. 
---
if she had applied for any money during his absence
---
that her pride had stood in her way, and
---
that she
 had suffered privation
---
which her blood, her simplicity, even her poverty, had not
 engendered
---
was instantly excited by her sin
---
if you do love her as much as she do
 and
---
his
 mother watched his thin figure.

---
Tess had been compelled by
 Alec d'Urberville, in his whim of reformation
---
that she would never wilfully tempt him again
---
from which she had

---
referred to by her mother
---
though Tess was remembered well enough by her
 Christian name
---
she had obviously never used during their
 separation,
---
She had

---
she was not now at Marlott
---
who had been so churlish with Tess

---
in which Tess had passed the years of her childhood
---
The house was
 now inhabited by another family who had never known her. 
---
when Tess lived

---
that for some reason or
 other she had not wished, and
---
She came to the door herself, and
---
the
 light from the evening sky fell upon her face.


---
This was the first time that Clare had ever met her, but
---
she was still a handsome woman,
 in the garb of a respectable widow
---
Because she've not come home," said Joan.


---
if she is well
---
" I do n't. 
---
," said she.


---
" I admit it. 
---
Where is she staying?"


---
From the beginning of the interview Joan had disclosed her
 embarrassment by keeping her hand to the side of her cheek.


---
exactly where she is staying
---
," she answered.
---
" She
 was-- but--"

" Where was she?"


---
" Well, she is not there now."


---
In her evasiveness she paused again, and
---
"," Joan whispered. 
---
Tess would wish
---
If not, of
 course--"

" I do n't think.
---
she would
---
" I am sure she would n't."


---
" I am sure she would!"
---
" I know her better
."


---
"; for I have never really known her."


---
Tess's mother again restlessly swept her cheek with
 her vertical hand, and a low voice--


---
, she at last said,
---
" She is at Sandbourne."


---
" I do n't know more particularly than I have said--
---
For
 myself, I was never there."


---
that Joan spoke the truth in this
---
" No, sir," she replied. 
---
Where could Tess possibly be, a cottage- girl, his young wife, amidst
 all this wealth and fashion? 
---
She was most probably engaged; and
---
she reposed at that moment
---
that she would have been likely to continue the use
 of her maiden name, Clare said--

" Of a Miss Durbeyfield
---
that she had reverted to
 the real pronunciation
---
If poor Tess was a servant here
---
,, she
 would go to the back- door to that milkman, and
---
, the landlady herself opened the door. 
---
Tess, then, passed as a married woman, and
---
even though
 she had not adopted his name
---
" Will you kindly tell her?"


---
that a relative is anxious to see her
---
She'll understand.
---
if she is awake
---
Obviously her position was by no means so
 bad as he had feared, and
---
that she must somehow
 have claimed and
---
what will she think of me
---
Tess appeared on the threshold-- not at all as he had expected to
 see her-- bewilderingly otherwise, indeed. 
---
Her great natural beauty
 was, if not heightened, rendered more obvious by her attire. 
---
She
 was loosely wrapped in a cashmere dressing- gown of gray- white,
, and
---
she wore slippers of the same
 hue. 
---
Her neck rose out of a frill of down, and
---
her well- remembered
 cable of dark- brown hair was partially coiled up in a mass at the
 back of her head and.


---
for she had not come forward,
---
What name shall I give, sir?"

" I'll see."

 as I
 am"," said she,.


---
her voice sounding hard through the room,

---
her eyes shining unnaturally
---
" I did not think rightly of you
---
-- I did not see you!"
---
" I have learnt to since,
---
she said,. 
---
because I have been so pulled
 down by illness
---
-- I am come on purpose for
 you--!"


---
my mother and father will welcome you now
---
But I say,."


---
I say
---
She seemed. 
---
" I inquired here and there, and
---
I found the way.
---
" I waited and,
---
waited for you" she went on,. 
---
her tones suddenly
 resuming their old fluty pathos
---
And I wrote
 to you, and
---
that I was a foolish woman. 
---
He--"

" I do n't understand."


---
gathering her meaning, flagged
 like one plague- stricken, and; it fell on her hands,
.


---
I hate him now,; and
---
what put upon me: I did n't care! 
---
; that his original Tess had spiritually ceased to
.


---
that Tess was gone
---
as
 she deemed them
---
Nevertheless, the visit of
 Angel Clare to her well- paying tenants, Mr and Mrs d'Urberville,, was sufficiently exceptional in point of time and
 manner.


---
Tess had spoken to her husband from the doorway, without entering
 the dining- room, and Mrs Brooks, who stood within the partly- closed
 door of her own sitting- room at the back of the passage,. 
---
She heard Tess re- ascend
 the stairs to the first floor, and the departure of Clare, and the
 closing of the front door behind him. 
---
Mrs Brooks knew that Tess had re- entered her
 apartment. 
---
that she would not emerge again for some time
---
She accordingly ascended the stairs softly, and. 
---
All that she could at first distinguish of them was one syllable,
"


---
Over the seat of the chair Tess's face was bowed
---
, her
 posture being a kneeling one in front of it; her hands were clasped
 over her head,.

---
the skirts of her dressing- gown and the embroidery of
 her night- gown flowed upon the floor behind her, and her stockingless
 feet, from which the slippers had fallen, protruded upon the carpet
---
It was from her lips.


---
She did not answer, but.

---
My little sisters and
 brothers and my mother's needs-- they were the things you moved me
 by... and
---
In writhing, with her head on the chair, she turned her
 face towards the door, and
---
that her lips were bleeding from the clench of her teeth upon
 them, and that the long lashes of her closed eyes stuck in wet tags
 to her cheeks
---
She continued:"... 
---
; then a sudden rustle;
 she had sprung to her feet. 
---
She need not have done so, however, for the door of the sitting- room
. 
---
She could hear nothing through the floor,. 
---
although she listened
 intently, and
---
she took up some sewing,. 
---
for her lodgers to ring
---
that she
 might take away the breakfast, which she meant to do herself, to
 discover what was the matter if possible
---
as she sat
---
Overhead,, she
 could now hear,, and
---
presently the movement was explained by the rustle
 of garments against the banisters, the opening and the closing of
 the front door, and the form of Tess passing to the gate on her way
 into the street. 
---
She was fully dressed now in the walking costume
 of a well- to- do young lady in which she had arrived, with the sole
 addition that over her hat and black feathers a veil was drawn.


---
Mrs Brooks had not been able to catch any word of farewell, temporary
 or otherwise, between her tenants at the door above. 
---
She went into the back room, which was more especially her own
 apartment, and. 
---
As she did so
---
her eyes glanced casually over the ceiling. 
---
till they
 were arrested by a spot in the middle of its white surface which she
 had never noticed there before
---
when she first observed it
---
it speedily grew as large as the palm
 of her hand, and
---
then she could perceive. 
---
She got upon the table,
 and.
---
she fancied.


---
Descending from the table, she left the parlour, and. 
---
as she had now
 become
---
But, nerveless woman, she could not bring herself. 
---
She
 listened. 
---
she knew,
---
she begged him
---
to come in and go
 upstairs with her; she feared. 
---
something had happened to one of her
 lodgers
---
She opened the door of the drawing- room, and. 
---
as when she had taken it up
---
She asked the man to
.


---
I think!"


---
The form descending the incline was a woman's, yet. 
---
that even
 when she came nearer
---
till she was
 quite close that he could believe her to be Tess
---
I saw you
---
just before I got there
---
I have been following you all this way!"


---
She was so pale, so breathless,
---
she said,,
---
what I have
 been running after you for
---
that I have killed him
---
A pitiful white smile lit her face.


---
as she spoke
---
that she
 was in some delirium
---
," she continued. 
---
"," she murmured in a reverie.


---
that she had faintly attempted,

---
at least, what she said; and
---
she had done
---
Unable to realize the
 gravity of her conduct, she seemed at last content; and
---
as she lay upon his shoulder
---
of which she
 spoke
---
that in the moment of mad grief, her mind had lost its balance, and
---
that was
 not, in her mind, within the region of the possible
---
said--

" I will not desert you
---
I will protect you by every means in my
 power, dearest love,!"


---
Tess turning her head every now
 and
---
that she did not discern the least fault in his appearance
---
who had
 believed in her as pure!


---
Thus they proceeded for
 several miles till Tess,
---
" I do n't know, dearest. 
---
" I do n't know."


---
I could walk for ever and ever with your arm round me!"


---
Tess would have
, but
---
that
 she carried
---
" I feel strong enough to walk any distance
---
," said she.


---
" I think, and
---
She made no reply to this beyond that of grasping him more tightly,
 and straight inland. 
---
I know it
---
"," said Tess.


---
" Just to air the rooms, I suppose.
---
" she asked.


---
" I have been thinking of that empty mansion we passed
---
where she was,
---
She sat down among the bushes within the gate, and
---
Tess was wildly anxious, not for herself, but for
 him. 
---
that there was only an old woman in
 charge as caretaker
---
she only came there on fine days, from the
 hamlet near,. 
---
She would come. 
---
Under his escort she went tardily forward to the main front, whose
 shuttered windows, like sightless eyeballs, excluded the possibility
 of watchers. 
---
lest the woman should

---
Between six
 and seven o'clock she came, but
---
her close the windows
---
In the small hours she
 whispered to him the whole story of how he had walked in his sleep
 with her in his arms across the Froom stream, at the imminent risk of
 both their lives, and laid her down in the stone coffin at the ruined
 abbey. 
---
" Do n't think of!" said she. 
---
" I am not going outside of now. 
---
go forwards towards Southampton or London, she showed a strange
 unwillingness to move.


---
she
 deprecated. 
---
," she said,
---
" And-- and pressing her cheek against his," I fear. 
---
I do not wish.
---
I would rather be dead
 and.
---
" I can not ever despise you."


---
" I also hope that. 
---
But considering, I can not
 see.... 
---
How wickedly mad I was! 
---
Yet formerly I never could bear to
."


---
The brilliant sunrise made her unusually brisk
---
; she decided, and. 
---
that, having arrived and opened the lower
 rooms before six o'clock, she ascended to the bedchambers, and
---
At that moment
 she fancied. 
---
she could hear the breathing of persons within
---
Her
 slippers and her antiquity had rendered her progress a noiseless one
 so far, and
---
she made for instant retreat;
---
that her
 hearing might have deceived her
---
then, deeming, she turned anew to the door and
. 
---
a piece of
 furniture had been moved forward on the inside, which prevented her
 opening the door more than an inch or two. 
---
the elegance of Tess's gown hanging across a
 chair
---
in which she had arrived
---
because she had none else
---
with, her silk stockings beside it, the pretty parasol, and the
 other habits, that
 her first indignation at the effrontery of tramps and vagabonds gave
 way to a momentary sentimentality over this genteel elopement,. 
---
She closed the door, and.


---
as she had come
---
Not more than a minute had elapsed after her withdrawal. 
---
when Tess
 woke, and then Clare
---
I think
---
At any rate, the
 woman will be sure to come to- day."


---
She passively assented, and
---
she turned.


---
she said. 
---
Having thus persuaded her, the plan was pursued, and
---
To walk across country without much regard to roads was not new
 to Tess, and
---
she showed her old agility in the performance. 
---
" It hums," said she. 
---
Tess drew
 her breath fearfully, and Angel, perplexed, said--

""


---
But Tess, really tired by this time, flung herself upon an oblong
 slab that lay close at hand, and. 
---
Owing to the action of the sun during the preceding day, the
 stone was warm and dry, in comforting contrast to the rough and chill
 grass around, which had damped her skirts and shoes.


---
to go any further" she said,. 
---
" I fear not. 
---
One of my mother's people was a shepherd hereabouts
---
", now I think of
 it. 
---
that I was a heathen
---
So now
 I am at home."


---
I think.
---
I like very much
---
" to be here," she murmured. 
---
and I wish."


---
though she might as well rest here
---
" she asked,.


---
" I will."


---
" She is so good and simple and pure. 
---
O, Angel-- I wish. 
---
you would
 marry her
---
If I lose you
---
" I lose all! 
---
And she is my sister- in- law."


---
she is growing
 so beautiful
---
O, I could share you with her willingly! 
---
If you would train her and!...
