One evening of late summer, a young man and woman, the latter carrying a
 child, were approaching the large village of Weydon- Priors, in Upper
 Wessex, on foot.
---
The man was of fine figure, swarthy, and stern in aspect; and
---
he
 showed in profile a facial angle so slightly inclined as to be almost
 perpendicular.
---
He wore a short jacket of brown corduroy, newer than the
 remainder of his suit, which was a fustian waistcoat with white horn
 buttons, breeches of the same, tanned leggings, and
---
At his back he carried by a looped strap a
 rush basket,
---
His measured,
 springless walk was the walk of the skilled countryman as distinct from
 the desultory shamble of the general labourer;
---
, a dogged and cynical indifference
 personal to himself, showing its presence even in the regularly
 interchanging fustian folds, now in the left leg, now in the right,.


---
as
 he paced along
---
that the man was reading, or
---
which he kept before his eyes with some difficulty by the
 hand that was passed through the basket strap
---
whether it were an assumed one to escape
 an intercourse that would have been irksome to him, nobody but himself

---
his taciturnity was unbroken, and
---
Sometimes the
 man's bent elbow almost touched her shoulder,
---
he of offering it; and far from
 exhibiting surprise at his ignoring silence she appeared.
---
That the man and woman were husband and wife, and
---
described, the family group was met by a turnip- hoer with his hoe on
 his shoulder, and
---
his dinner- bag suspended from it.
---
" Any trade doing here?" he asked phlegmatically,.
---
And thinking not understand him, he added," Anything in the hay- trussing line?"


---
" Why, save the man,
 what wisdom's in him?"


---
he obviously was
---
Looking towards the village, he continued,"
---
The trusser and his family proceeded on their way, and but
.
---
The man mentally weighed the two inscriptions
 and.


---
"," said the man.
---
However, he gave way to her
 representations, and
---
The young man and woman ordered a basin each of the mixture, steaming
 hot, and.
---
the
 man, with the instinct of a perverse character, scented it quickly.

---
After a mincing attack on his bowl, he watched the hag's proceedings
 from the corner of his eye, and.
---
He winked to
 her, and
---
The man as slily sent back money in payment.


---
He found the concoction,.
---
he persuaded her, and
---
The man finished his basin, and
---
The effect of it was soon
 apparent in his manner, and his wife but.


---
But he turned a deaf ear to those bird- like chirpings.
---
He talked loud to
 the company.
---
At the end of the first basin the man had risen to serenity
---
at the
 second he was jovial
---
signified by the shape of his face, the occasional clench of
 his mouth, and the fiery spark of his dark eye
---
; he was overbearing-- even brilliantly quarrelsome.


---
The ruin of good men by bad wives, and, more particularly, the
 frustration of many a promising youth's high aims and hopes and the
 extinction of his energies by an early imprudent marriage, was the
 theme.


---
He
 pointed at himself and family with a wave of the hand intended to bring
 out the penuriousness of the exhibition.


---
The man continued--

"
---
if I were a free man
---
why men do n't want'em
---
,
 should n't get rid of'em,"
  said the man in the tent.
---
From his appearance he had

---
", I may say, as
 any man
---
," he added," and; and
---
Then,
 crossing his legs, he resumed his pipe with a nicely- adjusted gaze at a
 point in the air.


---
The fuddled young husband stared for a few seconds at this unexpected
 praise of his wife, half in doubt of the wisdom of his own attitude
 towards the possessor of such qualities.
---
But he speedily lapsed into his
 former conviction, and
---
who had gone on lacing his
 furmity more and more heavily
---
though he was either so strong- minded or
 such an intrepid toper
---
But a quarter of an hour later the man,, that he still appeared fairly sober,."
---
waited; yet he did not move.
---
In ten minutes the man broke
 in upon the desultory conversation of the furmity drinkers with.
---
" said the man.


---
" Nor you to mine," said he.
---
;" yer good man do n't know."


---
what he's

---
" No insults," said the husband.
---
" Behave yerself moral, good man, for Heaven's love!
---
" to give
 more," said the husband.
---
" Three guineas-- going for three guineas!" said the rheumy man.


---
" No bid?" said the husband.
---
," said the
 husband,.
---
" I'll sell
 her for five guineas to any man that will pay me the money, and; and.

---
he shall have her for ever, and
---
A dead silence
 followed his affirmation.


---
Upon the
 face of this he clinked down the shillings severally-- one, two, three,
 four, five.


---
that the
 man, in spite of his tantalizing declaration, was really in earnest
---
that, being out
 of work, he was, as a consequence, out of temper with the world, and
 society, and his nearest kin
---
, I and this girl go with the man.
---
his
 resentment rising at her suggestion
---
He took the sailor's notes and.


---
Come along!" he said kindly.

---
as he made towards the
 door
---
A stolid look of concern filled the husband's face,; and
---
as if, after all, he
 had not quite anticipated this ending
---
" he said.


---
He rose and.
---
In presence of this scene after the other there was a
 natural instinct to abjure man as the blot on an otherwise kindly
 universe.


---
He's without
 doubt a stranger here."


---
He came in about five minutes ago
---
I'm not a penny the better for him."


---
if a
 husband had behaved so to me!
---
his keacorn was raw; but
---
the man do seem."


---
The man stretched his elbows
 forward on the table.
---
where the man reclined
---
where he was
---
when
 the man awoke
---
He looked about-- at the
 benches-- at the table-- at his basket of tools-- at
 the stove where the furmity had been boiled-- at the empty basins-- at
 some she d grains of wheat-- at the corks which dotted the grassy floor.

---
Among the odds and ends he discerned a little shining object, and.
---
It was his wife's ring.


---
he thrust his hand into his breast- pocket.
---
This second verification of his dim memories was enough
---
; he knew.
---
He remained seated,.
---
"," he said deliberately
 at last, with the air of one who could not catch his thoughts without
 pronouncing them.
---
He stood up,.
---
that he was in fairly good condition for progress,
 unencumbered
---
Next he shouldered his tool basket, and.
---
he could
 carry it
---
Then lifting the tent door he emerged into the open air.


---
Here the man looked around with gloomy curiosity.
---
as he stood
---
He and his family
 had been weary, and
---
; so that he now beheld it as a new thing.
---
He was the only positive spectator of the hay- trusser's exit from the
 Weydon Fair- field.


---
He went on in silent thought,
.
---
When he reached a lane, a good mile from the scene of the
 previous evening
---
, the man pitched his basket and leant upon a gate.
---
A
 difficult problem or two occupied his mind.


---
he said to himself; and
---
that he did not
---
His general
 demeanour was enough to show how he was surprised and nettled that his
 wife had taken him so literally-- as much could be seen in his face, and
 in the way he nibbled a straw which he pulled from the hedge.
---
He knew

---
On this latter point he felt almost certain,.
---
when he had declared during a fuddle that he
 would dispose of her as he had done
---
him say that many times more before it happened, in the resigned
 tones of a fatalist
---
" he exclaimed.
---
he
 roared out.
---
When he was
---
calmer he turned to his original conviction.
---
that he must
 somehow find her and his little Elizabeth- Jane, and
---
as best he could
---
It was of his own making, and
---
he ought.
---
But first he resolved.


---
than he
 had ever sworn before
---
properly he required a fit place and
 imagery;
---
for there was something fetichistic in this man's beliefs
---
He shouldered his basket and.

---
as he walked, and
---
He instantly made towards the latter object.
---
Hence he reached the church without observation, and
---
he entered.
---
The hay- trusser deposited his basket
 by the font,
---
till he reached the altar- rails, and

---
where he seemed
---
went up the nave opening the gate entered the sacrarium, to feel a
 sense of the strangeness for a moment; then he knelt upon the
 footpace.
---
Dropping his head upon the clamped book, he said aloud--

".
---
may strook dumb, blind, and helpless,"

 When he had said it and
---
he saw a thick jet of wood smoke
---
He went round to the door, and
---
Then he started on the search for his wife and child.


---
Though he examined and.
---
he described
---
he could gain
 no sound of the sailor's name
---
As money was short with him
---
he decided,
; but
---
that a
 certain shyness of revealing his conduct prevented Michael Henchard from
 following up the investigation with the loud hue- and- cry such a pursuit
 demanded to render it effectual; and
---
that he obtained no clue,
---
though everything was done by him
---
still he searched on,.
---
he had

---
there he derived intelligence.
---
that persons
 answering somewhat to his description had emigrated a little time
 before
---
Then he said.


---
he would search no longer, and
---
that he would go and

---
which he had had for some time in his mind
---
Next day he started,, and.





---
till he reached the town of Casterbridge,
 in a far distant part of Wessex
---
One of the two was she who had figured as the young
 wife of Henchard on the previous occasion
---
that this was Susan Henchard's
 grown- up daughter.
---
I first met with Newson-- on such a day as this.
---
" First met with father here?
---
And now
 he's drowned and!"
---
" What is his exact kin to us, mother?
---
He is, or
---
for he may be dead-- a connection by marriage
---
He's not a near relation
---
He was a hay- trusser,
---
" was n't he,?

"
---
when you last heard of him
---
He was."


---
he never knew me
---
Mrs. Henchard paused for a moment, and.
---
"," said Mrs. Newson,.
---
It was indeed the former mistress of the furmity tent-- once thriving,
 cleanly, white- aproned, and chinking with money-- now tentless, dirty,
 owning no tables or benches, and having scarce any customers except
 two small whity- brown boys, who came up and asked for" A ha'p'orth,
 please-- good measure," which she served in a couple of chipped yellow
 basins of commonest clay.


---
"," resumed Mrs. Newson,.


---
Mrs. Newson glanced round--."
---
At any rate, I can mind a man doing something o' the sort-- a man in a
 cord jacket, with a basket of tools; but
---
why I can mind the
 man
---
that he came back here to the next year's fair, and
---
he had gone
 to-- where?--Casterbridge-- yes-- to Casterbridge
---
told me quite
 private- like to say, said he.
---
Mrs. Newson would have rewarded the old woman as far as her small
 means afforded had she not discreetly borne in mind.
---
her husband had been degraded
---
" The last time he said.
---
he was living at
 Casterbridge
---
that he said it
---
The risk of endangering a child's strong affection by
 disturbing ideas was to Mrs. Henchard
 too fearful a thing to contemplate.
---
But Susan Henchard's fear of losing her dearly loved daughter's heart by
 a revelation.
---
Her simplicity-- the original ground of Henchard's contempt for
 her-- had allowed.
---
that Newson
 had acquired a morally real and justifiable right to her by his
 purchase--
---
The history of Susan Henchard's adventures in the interim can be told
 in two or three sentences.
---
where Newson made a living for a few years as boatman and general handy
 shoreman
---
He then engaged in the Newfoundland trade, and
---
When Newson came home at the end of one winter
---
he saw
.


---
he had
---
There was then a time of sadness, in which she told him her doubts
 if she could live with him longer.
---
Newson left home again on the
 Newfoundland trade.
---
The vague news of his
 loss at sea a little later on solved a problem which had become torture
 to her meek conscience.
---
Susan's
 staunch, religious adherence to him as her husband in principle,, was demanded no more.
---
he might
---
; for in her time with him he had been given to bouts
 only, and.


---
if he lived
---
At any rate, the propriety of returning to him,, was
 unquestionable.
---
The awkwardness of searching for him lay in enlightening
 Elizabeth, a proceeding which her mother could not endure to
 contemplate.
---
him to take what steps
---
he might choose to that
 end
---
afforded of Henchard's whereabouts by the furmity woman
---
two
 men passed outside the hedge
---
" those men mentioned the
 name of Henchard in their talk-- the name of our relative
---
," said Mrs. Newson.


---
" That seems a hint to us that he is still here."


---
He may be in the workhouse, or
 in the stocks,."


---
The sight reminded Mrs. Henchard- Newson and her daughter; and
---
" And less good beer than swipes," said a man with his hands in his
 pockets.


---
" Oh,' tis the corn- factor-- he's the man that our millers and bakers all
 deal wi', and
---
he has sold'em growed wheat,,
---
how he stands in the town
---
if he is here,
---
he must be
---
"," said the old man, without taking
 his eyes from the window.
---
That's Mr. Henchard, the Mayor, at the end of the table,; and
---
that's the Council men right and left....
---
" Henchard!" said Elizabeth- Jane, surprised, but by no means suspecting
 the whole force of the revelation.
---
before the old
 man's words," Mr. Henchard, the Mayor," reached her ears.
---
He had a rich complexion, which verged on
 swarthiness, a flashing black eye, and dark, bushy brows and hair.
---
When
 he indulged in an occasional loud laugh at some remark among the
 guests,
---
his large mouth parted so far back.


---
that he obviously still could boast of
---
if he had
 any
---
Susan Henchard's husband-- in law, at least-- sat before them,, exaggerated in traits; thought- marked-- in a word, older.
---
He was
.

---
Three glasses stood at his right hand; but,
---
to his wife's surprise, the
 two for wine were empty,.


---
he was sitting in a corduroy jacket, fustian
 waistcoat and breeches, and tanned leather leggings, with a basin of hot
 furmity before him.
---
Have
 you seen him, mother
---
" I have seen him, and
---
whispered in her mother's ear," Does
 he seem to you not likely to befriend us?
---
he looked a generous
 man
---
What a gentleman he is,!

---
is n't he? and
---
how his diamond studs shine
---
he might be in the stocks, or in
 the workhouse, or dead
---
Why do
 you feel so afraid of him?
---
; I'll call upon him
---
-- he can
 but say."


---
he do n't own such remote kin
---
Rest there a little while-- I will look on and find out more about him."


---
I can ever meet Mr. Henchard
---
He is not
---
he
 would be
---
-- he overpowers me!
---
" They do n't fill Mr. Henchard's wine- glasses
---
him to be the celebrated abstaining worthy of
 that name
---
He scorns all tempting liquors
---
that he sware
 a gospel oath in bygone times
---
So they
 do n't press him,
---
Another elderly man, hearing this discourse, now joined in by inquiring,
" Solomon Longways?"


---
How much longer have he got,
---
why and the wherefore of
 his fixing such a time, for' a never has told anybody
---
why, it
 keeps a man up, no doubt
---
," said Longways.


---
When did he lose his wife
---
Twas afore he came to Casterbridge
---
," Solomon
 Longways replied with terminative emphasis,.
---
as if the fact of his
 ignorance of Mrs. Henchard were sufficient to deprive her history of all
 interest
---
if any of
 his men be ever so little overtook by a drop
---
that he's down upon'em as stern
 as the Lord upon the jovial Jews
---
" Has he many men, then?" said Elizabeth- Jane.


---
Why, my good maid, he's the powerfullest member of the Town
 Council, and quite a principal man in the country round besides.
---
Never
 a big dealing in wheat, barley, oats, hay, roots, and such- like but
 Henchard's got a hand in it.
---
Ay, and he'll go into other things too;
 and
---
where he makes his mistake
---
He worked his way up from nothing

---
now he's a pillar of the town.
---
Not but what he's
 been shaken a little to- year about this bad corn he has supplied in
 his contracts.
---
though Mr. Henchard has never cussed me
, but
---
Henchard's voice arose above the rest
---
; he was telling a story of his
 hay- dealing experiences,.


---
in which he had outwitted a sharper who had
 been bent upon outwitting him
---
" Ha- ha- ha!" responded his audience at the upshot of the story; and

---
"," he said.
---
And the poor folk to eat it whether or no," said the
 inharmonious man outside the window.


---
Henchard's face darkened.
---
"," he
 said.
---
to be well looked after by myself alone, I have advertised for
 a thorough good man as manager of the corn department.
---
When I've got
 him
---
" to do to repay us for the past?" inquired the
 man who had before spoken, and."
---
Henchard's face had become still more stern at these interruptions, and

---
he drank from his tumbler of water.

---
Instead of vouchsafing a direct reply, he stiffly observed--

" If anybody will tell me.
---
Henchard was not.
---
Having said this, he sat down.





---
either there appeared a stranger-- a young man of remarkably pleasant
 aspect-- who carried in his hand a carpet- bag of the smart floral pattern
 prevalent in such articles at that time.


---
He was ruddy and of a fair countenance, bright- eyed, and slight in
 build.
---
He might possibly have passed by without stopping at all, or
---
his advent
 coincided with the discussion on corn and bread, in which event this
 history had never been enacted
---
he whispered some inquiries of the other bystanders, and.


---
When he heard Henchard's closing words," It ca n't be done
---
," he smiled
 impulsively,.
---
He tore out the leaf, but,
---
till he reached the door of the hotel, where one of the
 waiters who had been serving inside was now idly
---
" Give this to the Mayor at once," he said,.


---
Elizabeth- Jane had seen his movements and.
---
," he
 languidly answered;" but."


---
as he seemed,
---
The Scotchman, to be thanked him, and.
---
apparently more concerned
 about the question of an inn than about the fate of his note, now that
 the momentary impulse of writing it was over
---
While he was disappearing
 slowly down the street
---
Henchard looked at it carelessly,.
---
which had held possession of his face since the
 subject of his corn- dealings
---
He read the note slowly, and.


---
Men were putting their heads together in
 twos and threes,.
---
Square- built men showed a tendency to become hunchbacks
---
; men with
 a dignified presence lost it in a curious obliquity of figure,
---
Only Henchard did not conform to these flexuous changes
---
; he
 remained stately and vertical,.


---
" We can think to- morrow what is best to do about him.
---
where the young man has gone to
---
" He is respectable.
---
to hold him in abstraction; till, whispering to his
 neighbour to take his place, he found opportunity to leave the chair.

---
This was just after the departure of his wife and Elizabeth.


---
Outside the door of the assembly- room he saw the waiter, and.


---
He was a Scotchman seemingly."


---
" Did he say?"


---
how he had got it
---
" He wrote it himself, sir,."


---
as he stood outside the window
---
.... Is the young man in the hotel?
---
He went to the Three Mariners
---
The mayor walked up and down the vestibule of the hotel with his hands
 under his coat tails,.
---
as if he were merely seeking a cooler atmosphere
 than that of the room he had quitted
---
But there could be no doubt that
 he was in reality still possessed to the full by the new idea, whatever
 that might be.
---
At length he went back to the door of the dining- room,
.
---
Seeing this the
 Mayor took his hat, and
---
when the waiter had helped him on with a thin
 holland overcoat
---
Very few persons were now in the street; and his eyes, by a sort of
 attraction,.
---
whose two prominent Elizabethan gables, bow- window, and
 passage- light could be seen from where he stood
---
Having kept his eyes on
 it for a while he strolled in that direction.


---
This ancient house of accommodation for man and beast, now,
 unfortunately, pulled down,.
---
As a
 matter of fact, this state of things was not so much owing to Stannidge
 the landlord's neglect, as from the lack of a painter in Casterbridge
 who would undertake to reproduce the features of men so traditional.


---
Henchard stood without the inn for a few instants
---
, he entered the inn door.





---
a stately slowness, however, entering
 into his ministrations by contrast with theirs,
---
duly met Stannidge the landlord, a silent man, carried frothing measures to this room and to that, shoulder to
 shoulder with his waiting- maids-- as became one whose
 service was somewhat optional.
---
whom her husband overlooked
---
Mr. Henchard is too high
---
ourselves known to him
---
if his supper is on
 the tray
---
you can take it up to him.
---
He was now and,
---
how his forehead shone
---
how nicely his
 hair was cut, and
---
that was on the skin
 at the back of his neck
---
the sort of velvet- pile or down, and how his cheek was so truly curved as to be
 part of a globe, and
---
how clearly drawn were the lids and lashes which
 hid his bent eyes.


---
The tremors in Susan Henchard's tone might have led any person but.


---
Two men were indeed talking in the adjoining chamber
---
which
 Mrs. Henchard mechanically did
---
Henchard seemed and
---
in a moment he resumed:
"?"
---
Then," said Henchard,"?
---
My name is Henchard, ha'n't
---
Surely you are the man
---
Joshua, Joshua, Jipp-- Jopp-- what was his name?"


---
said the young man.
---
" My name is Donald Farfrae.
---
you were the man!"


---
till
 Henchard resumed:"
---
The young man reflected a moment or two.
---
," he said.
---
, he exclaimed," There, now, do you
 taste that."


---
But hearken to me," pleaded Henchard.
---
the young man
 still replied, with some distress in his accents.

"
---
said Henchard conclusively.
---
Donald Farfrae was grateful--
---
he feared
---
he must decline--
---
that he
 wished
---
young man, as it has done for the
 sample
---
Henchard paused.
---
"," he said.
---
you were not the man
---
He knows, and
---
that you are not the man who answered
 my advertisement, but
---
," said the young man.


---
Henchard again suspended his words, and
---
then his voice came
 thoughtfully:"
---
the nose, too, is n't unlike his.
---
Unluckily, I am bad at science, Farfrae; bad at
 figures-- a rule o' thumb sort of man.
---
Though you are
 not the young man I thought you were, what's the difference?
---
"," said the young man, in negative tones.
---
" No, no; would," said Henchard gravely,.
---
that he was rising
---
When
 I was a young man I went in for that sort of thing too strong-- far too
 strong-- and
---
," said Henchard, with
 strong feeling in his tones.
---
The young man appeared.
---
much moved by Henchard's warm convictions of
 his value
---
He was silent.
---
to," he replied.
---
the mother's face being strangely bright
 since Henchard's avowal of shame for a past action
---
that Donald Farfrae had again

---
his supper removed
---
rung his bell, no doubt to have; for humming a tune,
 and walking up and down, he seemed.
---
He sauntered
 out upon the landing, and.


---
When Elizabeth- Jane had carried down his supper tray, and.
---
now the Scotchman had made himself so soon at home.


---
that, at the request
 of some of the master- tradesmen, he, too, was favouring the room with a
 ditty
---
It was of such a kind that the snapping of a
 pipe- stem too long for him by old Solomon Longways, who was one of those
 gathered at the shady end of the room,.
---
the pathos of Donald's song was temporarily effaced.


---
"' Twas not amiss-- not at all amiss!" muttered Christopher Coney, who was
 also present.
---
And removing his pipe a finger's breadth from his lips, he
 said aloud,"."


---
And
 turning aside, he said in undertones,"?"


---
"," replied
 Coney.


---
Young Farfrae repeated the last verse.
---
with which he worked himself up to a
 climax
---
"?" inquired Christopher Coney, from the background,
 with the tone of a man who preferred the original subject.
---
Goda'mighty sending
 his little taties so terrible small to fill'em with
---
" But, no!" said Donald Farfrae,;" the best of ye hardly honest-- not that surely?
---
what did n't belong to him
---
" said Solomon Longways,.
---
" That's only his
 random way o' speaking.'
---
A was always such a man of underthoughts."
---
Christopher Coney was silenced, and
---
as he could get no public sympathy
---
,
 he mumbled his feelings to himself:"!
---
" Come," said Longways;"."


---
the young man draw onward with his ballet,

---
him breathe--
---
him breathe
---
He hain't got his
 second wind yet
---
" exclaimed the young man; and."


---
he at once rendered
" O Nannie" with faultless modulations, and another or two of the like
 sentiment,
---
he had completely taken possession of the hearts of the
 Three Mariners' inmates,
---
which the tone
 of his mind seemed
---
; he was to them like the poet of a new school who takes
 his contemporaries by storm
---
what all his listeners have felt
---
while the young
 man sang
---
" Ah-- no!" said the Scotchman, with melancholy fatality in his voice,
"!
---
"," said Solomon Longways.
---
And verily, to mak' acquaintance with a man a- come from so far, from the
 land o' perpetual snow,, where wolves and wild boars and
 other dangerous animalcules be as common as blackbirds here- about-- why,
' tis a thing we ca n't do every day; and
---
there's good sound information
 for bide- at- homes like we when such a man opens his mouth."

" Nay, but
---
," said the young man, looking round upon
 them with tragic fixity, till his eye lighted up and his cheek kindled
 with a sudden enthusiasm to right their errors.
---
He's a simple home- spun man, that
 never was fit for good company
---
" inquired
 Christopher Coney.


---
Donald's eyes dropped into a remote gaze
---
as he added:"
---
that his statements showed him
---
He had seen no jest in ambiguities and roguery,; and.
---
he did not appreciate them.
---
He seemed
---
early the young Scotchman expressed his wish to
 retire, whereupon the landlady whispered to Elizabeth to run upstairs
 and turn down his bed.
---
, Mr. Farfrae
 was at the foot.
---
that when confronting her he smiled; and then, with the manner of a
 temporarily light- hearted man, who has started himself on a flight of
 song
---
whose momentum he can not readily check
---
, he softly tuned an old
 ditty that she seemed to suggest--

         
---
, the latter was still in thought-- on quite
 another matter than a young man's song.


---
( that the Scotch- man might not
 overhear)
---
If he should befriend
 us, and and.
---
" he" was another man than her poor mother's.

---
" For myself I did n't at all mind waiting a little upon him.

---
He's so respectable, and.

---
They thought him very simple.
---
But of course he did n't know
---
-- he was"
---
Meanwhile, the" he" of her mother was not so far away.
---
After leaving the Three Mariners he had sauntered up and down
 the empty High Street,.

---
his voice had reached Henchard's ears through
 the heart- shaped holes in the window- shutters, and
---
he had said to
 himself.
---
Mr. Henchard-- now habited
 no longer as a great personage, but as a thriving man of business-- was

---
Henchard, had
 gone a little way past the inn.
---
before he had noticed his acquaintance of
 the previous evening
---
He came back a few steps, Donald Farfrae opening
 the window further.


---
Henchard looked at the
 bag as at an enemy.
---
there was no mistake about the young man's
 departure
---
" Ah, my lad," he said,."


---
" you should have been a wise man, and

---
"," said Donald.
---
Henchard turning to the other occasionally
---
He was a good man-- and
---
he's gone
---
" I was nothing
 to him, and
---
there was no reason why he should have wished me good- bye."


---
when the Scotchman came out at the
 door he had by accident
---
then he had looked away
 again without nodding, or smiling, or saying a word.


---
" Yes; I am thinking of Mr. Henchard's sudden liking for that young man.

---
He was always so.
---
if he takes so warmly to people who are
 not related to him at all
---
Now, surely,, may he not take as warmly to his own kin?"


---
The spectacle renewed his wife's conviction that, for her daughter's
 sake, she should strain a point to rejoin him.


---
that Mrs. Henchard decided, for good or for ill,
---
whether or not
 he would recognize her
---
He had been described as a lonely widower; and

---
he had expressed shame for a past transaction of his life.
---
If he says
---
if he thinks
---
he has

---
us call on him as-- his distant
 kinfolk
---
he did say so,
---
as I have
 not seen him for so many years
---
we are so-- little allied to him!"


---
if he say yes
---
when and how he will see us-- or ME
---
continued her mother," I have no claim upon him-- that
 I am glad to find he is thriving
---
And tell him,"
 ; that I hope."
---
his life may be long and
 happy-- there
---
He was bound also,
 cellar- hatches, church buttresses, and the overhanging angles of walls
 which, originally unobtrusive, had become bow- legged and knock- kneed.


---
, their forelegs on the pavement, their
 hind legs in the street, in which position they occasionally nipped
 little boys by the shoulder who were passing to school.
---
To
 express satisfaction the Casterbridge market- man added to his utterance
 a broadening of the cheeks, a crevicing of the eyes,.

---
If he wondered,
---
though all Henchard's carts and waggons were rattling
 past him
---
, you knew it from perceiving the inside of his crimson mouth,
 and a target- like circling of his eyes.
---
Deliberation caused sundry
 attacks on the moss of adjoining walls with the end of his stick,
 a change of his hat from the horizontal to the less so
---
Henchard's
 house was one of the best, faced with dull red- and- grey old brick.
---
Mr. Henchard was not in the house, but in the store- yard.
---
He
 directed her to an office which she had not seen before, and knocking at
 the door."


---
His hat hung on a peg behind him, and the roses
 of his carpet- bag glowed from the corner of the room.


---
said the Scotchman, like a man who permanently ruled
 there.


---
He's engaged just now," said.
---
the young
 man, apparently not recognizing her as the girl at the inn
---
He handed
 her a chair,.

---
waiting in great amaze at the young man's
 presence we may briefly explain.


---
how he came there
---
" Well, here's success to' ee," said Henchard,.

---
he paused,
---
Now I am not the man to let a cause be lost for want of
 a word
---
The young man's hand remained steady in Henchard's for a moment or two.

---
He looked over the fertile country that stretched beneath them, then
 backward along the shaded walk.
---
His face
 flushed.


---
" he said.
---
which had lain lifeless in Henchard's
---
His hand,, returned the latter's
 grasp.


---
" Done," said Henchard.


---
" Done," said Donald Farfrae.


---
The face of Mr. Henchard beamed forth a satisfaction that was almost
 fierce in its strength.
---
"!" he exclaimed.
---
Farfrae caught up his bag and.
---
as he had come
---
Henchard was all
 confidence now.


---
I am the most distant fellow in the world when I do n't care for a man
---
","
  he said.
---
when a man takes my fancy
---
" But he takes it strong.
---
"," said Farfrae with a smile.


---
,
 at which Henchard heaped the young Scotchman's plate to a prodigal
 fulness
---
He would not rest satisfied, and.
---
till Farfrae had written for his
 luggage from Bristol
---
this man of strong impulses declared.


---
that his new friend
 should take up his abode in his house--
---
He then took Farfrae round and.





---
a man came up to the
 door,.
---
as Henchard opened the door of the inner office
---
" The new manager!--he's in his office
---
," said Henchard bluntly.


---
In his office!" said the man, with a stultified air.


---
"," said Henchard;" and.
---
he must
 be you
---
"," murmured the man.


---
" Subject to an interview," said Henchard.
---
the man came out,.
---
that his mouth twitched
 with anger, and
---
that bitter disappointment was written in his face
 everywhere.


---
His dark pupils-- to have a red spark of light in
 them though this could hardly be a physical fact-- turned indifferently
 round under his dark brows until they rested on her figure."
---
Now then?" he said blandly.


---
He looked at her more thoughtfully.


---
The rich rouge- et- noir of his countenance underwent a slight change.

---
?" he asked with difficulty.


---
This at once suggested to Henchard.
---
that the transaction of his early
 married life at Weydon Fair was unrecorded in the family history
---
It was
 more than he could have expected.
---
"," he said.
---
that
 he showed her out of the office and through the outer room, where Donald
 Farfrae was overhauling bins and samples with the inquiring inspection
 of a beginner in charge
---
Henchard preceded her through the door in the
 wall to the suddenly changed scene of the garden and flowers, and
 onward into the house.
---
to which he introduced her
---
The dining- room still
 exhibited the remnants of the lavish breakfast laid for Farfrae.
---
on one lay three huge folio
 volumes-- a Family Bible, a" Josephus," and a" Whole Duty of Man
---
," he said,
---
as he uttered her name, and
---
sitting down himself he allowed
---
his hands
 to hang between his knees
---
while he looked upon the carpet
---
" A sailor's widow-- when did he die?"


---
" Father was lost last spring."


---
Henchard winced at the word" father
---
"?" he asked.


---
By such conversation he discovered the circumstances
 which had enveloped his wife and her child in such total obscurity that
 he had long ago believed them to be in their graves.
---
, he returned to the present."
---
repeated Henchard.
---
He arose,
.
---
," he said,
---
His eye fell on Elizabeth's clothes, which, though
 a respectable suit of black, and her very best, were decidedly
 old- fashioned even to Casterbridge eyes.

"
---
that he had divined this without her
 being obliged to express it
---
He sat down at the table and,.
---
which he put in the envelope with the
 letter
---
Sealing the
 whole up carefully, he directed it to" Mrs. Newson, Three Mariners Inn,"
  and.


---
" Deliver it to her personally, please," said Henchard.
---
He took her hand at parting, and
---
; having shut the door he sat in his dining- room
.

"
---
as if he read his history
 there
---
" he suddenly exclaimed,.
---
However, a something in Elizabeth- Jane soon assured him.
---
; for he had arranged
 in his note.


---
" said Henchard.
---
His keenly excited
 interest in his new friend the Scotchman was now eclipsed by this event,
 and
---
Donald Farfrae saw so little of him during the rest of the day that
 he wondered at the suddenness of his employer's moods.


---
Mr. Henchard
 used
---
He said nothing about the enclosure of five guineas.
---
that he bought her
 back again
---
who had lain there in his silent unobtrusive rest for a space of
 fifteen hundred years
---
He was mostly found, in an oval
 scoop in the chalk, like a chicken in its she ll
---
lying on his side; his knees drawn up to
 his chest;
---
sometimes with the remains of his spear against his arm,
 a fibula or brooch of bronze on his breast or forehead, an urn at
 his knees, a jar at his throat, a bottle at his mouth; and mystified
 conjecture pouring down upon him from the eyes of Casterbridge street
 boys and men, who had turned a moment to gaze at the familiar spectacle
 as they passed by.


---
who had murdered her husband

---
Some boys had latterly tried.
---
Possibly, too, the boys were timid, for some old people.


---
Henchard had chosen this spot as being the safest from observation which
 he could think of for meeting his long- lost wife, and at the same time
 as one easily to be found by a stranger after nightfall.
---
Just before eight he approached the deserted earth- work and.
---
In
 a few moments he could discern a female figure creeping in by the great
 north gap, or public gateway.
---
-- there was no necessity for speech-- and the
 poor woman leant against Henchard, who supported her in his arms.


---
"," he said in a low,.
---
" Those were his
 first words.


---
He felt her bow her head in acknowledgment.
---
After a
 minute or two he again began:

"!
---
that you
 had started for some colony with that man, and
---
because of him-- what other reason could there be?
---
when he had paid so
 much for me in good faith
---
I meet you now only as his widow
---
Had he not died!
---
not to go--" he said with kindly
 severity.
---
This would leave my shady, headstrong, disgraceful life
 as a young man absolutely unopened
---
", Michael," she said meekly.
---
to hear that," said Henchard gently.
---
"," said Mrs. Henchard, after
 a pause.
---
that our kinsman, Mr.
 Henchard, kindly wishes us
---
" Right," said Henchard.
---
" Never mind-- all in good time," said he.
---
He retreated, and.
---
Then Henchard himself went homeward,.
---
he reached his door
---
that by the
 time he was almost upon the heels of the unconscious
 woman from whom he had just parted
---
He watched her up the street, and
.





---
On entering his own door after watching his wife out of sight, the Mayor
 walked on through the tunnel- shaped passage into the garden, and thence
 by the back door towards the stores and granaries.
---
A light shone from
 the office- window, and Henchard could see.
---
Donald Farfrae still seated
---
where he had left him,

---
Henchard entered,."


---
He stood behind Farfrae's chair,.
---
yet it was not without a dash
 of pity for the tastes of any one who could care to give his mind to
 such finnikin details.
---
Henchard himself was mentally and physically
 unfit for grubbing subtleties from soiled paper
---
; he had in a modern
 sense.


---
"," he said at length,.
---
He shut
 the account- books with friendly force.


---
Donald had wished; but
---
he already saw, and
---
that his
 friend and employer was a man who knew no moderation in his requests and
 impulses
---
he yielded gracefully.
---
He liked Henchard's warmth,; the great difference in their characters adding
 to the liking.


---
even if
 it inconvenienced him
---
the young man followed his companion
 through the private little door which, admitting directly into
 Henchard's garden, permitted a passage from the utilitarian to the
 beautiful at one step.
---
when they were over
 Henchard
---
" He applied a light to the laid- in fuel, and
---
"," said Henchard,".
---
that two men should meet
---
But, damn it all, I am a lonely
 man, Farfrae
---
"," said Donald,
 allowing his eyes to travel over the intricate wood- carvings of the
 chimney- piece, representing garlanded lyres, shields, and quivers, on
 either side of a draped ox- skull, and.


---
," continued Henchard, his firm
---
He was plainly under that strange
 influence which sometimes prompts men to confide to the new- found
 friend what they will not tell to the old.
---
Would you think me a married man?"


---
I was a drinking man at that time."


---
Henchard paused a moment,.
---
so that his elbow rested
 on the table,
---
his forehead being shaded by his hand,
---
which, however, did
 not hide the marks of introspective inflexibility on his features
---
as
 he narrated in fullest detail the incidents of the transaction with the
 sailor
---
Henchard went on; the oath he
 swore; the solitary life he led during the years which followed.
---
he went on
---
But, Farfrae," said Henchard
 gloomily,"
---
that a man
 of my sort should have the good fortune to tide through twenty years o'
 life without making more blunders than one
---
," said Farfrae.


---
his
 pay sequestrated
---
He was dead now, and her mother too, and
---
Though, Farfrae, between you and me, as
 man and man, I solemnly declare
---
Donald showed his deep concern at a complication so far beyond the
 degree of his simple experiences.


---
what injury a man may cause around him
---
But these
 two." Henchard paused in reverie.
---
" I feel no less than the first, as kindly as a man can in such a case."


---
Never!" said Henchard.
---
Farfrae thereupon said no more.
---
carefully framed by him, and
---
, Henchard saying,!
---
he might be from the state of his
 pocket
---
said Farfrae.


---
When he was gone
---
Henchard copied the letter, and,,
.


---
from which he walked back thoughtfully
---
" he said.
---
which Michael Henchard hired for his wife Susan under her
 name of Newson-- in pursuance of their plan
---
As soon, with a
 white- aproned servant and all complete, Henchard paid them a visit,
 and.
---
carefully
 hoodwinked by the very general tone of the conversation that
 prevailed-- a proceeding which seemed to afford some humour to Henchard,
.
---
The visit was repeated
 again and again with business- like determination by the Mayor, who
 seemed to have schooled himself into a course of strict mechanical
 rightness towards this woman of prior claim, at any expense to the later
 one and to his own sentiments.


---
when Henchard came, and
---
he
 said drily,"."


---
at the furniture he had

---
Not at all," said Henchard, in rough benignity.
---
I shall soon be able to leave everything
 to him, and."


---
Henchard's visits here grew so frequent and so regular that it soon
 became whispered, and.
---
His well- known haughty indifference to the
 society of womankind, his silent avoidance of converse with the sex,
 contributed a piquancy to what would otherwise have been an unromantic
 matter enough.
---
Mrs. Henchard was so pale that the boys
 called her" The Ghost."
---
at which his face would darken with an expression of
 destructiveness towards the speakers ominous
---
he said
 nothing.


---
He pressed on the preparations for his union, or rather reunion, with
 this pale creature in a dogged, unflinching spirit which did credit
 to his conscientiousness.
---
Nobody would have conceived from his outward
 demeanour; nothing
 but three large resolves-- one, to make amends to his neglected Susan,
 another, to provide a comfortable home for Elizabeth- Jane under his
 paternal eye; and.


---
that there was no amatory fire or pulse of romance acting as
 stimulant to the bustle going on in his gaunt, great house
---
Susan Henchard entered a carriage for the first time in her life.
---
He, however, was too inexperienced, too thoughtful,
 too judicial, too strongly conscious of the serious side of the
 business,.
---
That required
 the special genius of Christopher Coney, Solomon Longways, Buzzford, and
 their fellows.
---
"' Tis five- and- forty years"
  said Coney;" but!
---
a man wait so long before to take
 so little
---
There's a chance even for thee after this, Nance Mockridge."
 
---
The remark was addressed to a woman who stood behind his shoulder-- the
 same who had exhibited Henchard's bad bread in public when Elizabeth and
 her mother entered Casterbridge.


---
any such as he, or thee either," replied that
 lady
---
And as for he-- well, there--(lowering her voice)' tis said
'."


---
" And now he's worth ever so much a minute
---
," murmured Longways.
---
When a
 man is said
---
" to be worth so much a minute, he's a man to be considered!"


---
Turning, he saw a circular disc.
---
Well, Mother Cuxsom," he said," how's this?

---
Here's Mrs. Newson, a mere skellinton, has got another husband to keep
 her,."


---
"' Tisn't worth my old while to think of another husband," continued Mrs.
 Cuxsom."
---
" said Christopher Coney.


---
And canst mind"--she
 prodded Solomon's shoulder with her finger- tip,!
---
Their reminiscences were cut short by the appearance of the reunited
 pair-- Henchard looking round upon the idlers with that ambiguous gaze
 of his, which at one moment seemed to mean satisfaction, and at another
 fiery disdain.


---
though he do call himself a
 teetotaller
---
"," said Nance Mockridge.
---
" Stuff-- he's well enough!
---
as wide as the ocean sea I would n't wish for a better man.
---
how to look at things in these times"
  said Solomon.
---
There was a man; and what wi' that, and this moist weather,
---
," said
 Christopher;"."





---
A Martinmas summer of Mrs. Henchard's life set in with her entry into
 her husband's large house and respectable social orbit; and well can be.
---
than he could give
---
he made a point of showing some semblance
 of it in external action
---
Among other things he had the iron railings,
 and
---
He was.
---
as kind to her as a man,
 mayor, and churchwarden could possibly be
---
as He used
---
Henchard had become very fond of her, and
---
" Ay-- of course-- to be sure," he replied in his leonine way."
---
Henchard was looking silently,, at this head of
 hair, which in colour was brown-- rather light than dark.
---
as he often did
---
" to be black he said to his wife.


---
as Henchard went on:

" Well, so much the better
---
But--"

" Well, then, I shall do it," he said, peremptorily."
---
Then Mrs. Henchard acted somewhat inconsistently
---
is it not a slight upon Newson--
---
now he's dead and"


---
conducted by Henchard
---
Meanwhile the great corn and hay traffic throve
 under the management of Donald Farfrae.

---
in which everything depended upon
 his memory, and
---
The old
 crude viva voce system of Henchard,, was swept
 away.
---
that Donald and Mr. Henchard were inseparables
---
When
 walking together Henchard would lay his arm familiarly on his manager's
 shoulder,.
---
as if Farfrae were a younger brother,
---
Donald had said,
---
In Henchard's somewhat lonely life he evidently found the young
 man as desirable for comradeship.

---
as he was useful for consultations
---
that he entertained of the
 slim Farfrae's physical girth, strength, and dash
---
more than
 counterbalanced by the immense respect he had for his brains
---
the
 younger man, his constant liking to have Farfrae near him
---
that Henchard's tigerish affection for, now and then
 resulted in a tendency to domineer, which, however, was checked in a
 moment when Donald exhibited marks of real offence
---
that their habit of
 walking and driving about together rather neutralized Farfrae's value
 as a second pair of eyes, which should be used in places where the
 principal was not
---
'," cried Henchard
---
that he had

---
he had never raised
 his eyes
---
that he looked, to Elizabeth- Jane's half- conscious,
 simple- minded, perhaps pardonable, disappointment
---
that it might be apparent only-- a way of turning his eyes that Mr.
 Farfrae had
---
that was afforded by the fact of Donald being the depositary
 of Henchard's confidence in respect of his past treatment of the pale,

---
that Henchard and her mother might have been lovers
 in their younger days, who had quarrelled and parted
---
The farmer's boy could sit under his barley- mow
 and pitch a stone into the office- window of the town- clerk
---
when he condemned a sheep- stealer
---
thrust their eaves against the church
 tower; green- thatched barns, with doorways as high as the gates of
 Solomon's temple, opened directly upon the main thoroughfare.
---
Henchard, as was natural, dealt largely with this nursery or bed of
 small farmers close at hand-- and
---
his waggons were often down that way.

---
whose contents Henchard was

---
the request had something to do with his business,
 and
---
He looked up at the church clock, and
.
---
before he had seen her
---
Farfrae advanced, and
---
he moved
 and.
---
He,
 too, was plainly expecting some one
---
In a few minutes he looked at his watch, and.


---
He must
 have heard the slight movement and.


---
for he looked up,
---
" Ah-- it's Miss Newson
---
," he said as soon as he could see into the
 granary.
---
" O Mr. Farfrae," she faltered,
---
And he held up his.


---
if the passer were about to enter and declare himself
 their summoner
---
," said Farfrae.
---
, I suppose, Mr. Farfrae
---
", Miss Newson"--and Donald's
 voice musically undulated between two semi- tones; but
---
when
 he became earnest--"it's well you feel a song for a few minutes, and

---
Then, Miss Newson better say nothing about this hoax, and
.
---
" he said, in tones of extreme delicacy."
---
As Elizabeth neither assented nor dissented Donald Farfrae began, and.
---
though Farfrae, having got
 over his first concern at the situation
---
get ye an umbrella," he said.


---
Farfrae walked slowly
 after
---
At first Miss Newson's budding beauty was not regarded with much
 interest by anybody in Casterbridge.
---
Donald Farfrae's gaze was now attracted by the Mayor's so- called step- daughter, but
---
he was
 only one.
---
Henchard gave Elizabeth- Jane a box of delicately- tinted gloves
 one spring day.
---
But Donald Farfrae admired her, too; and
---
Friendship between man and man; what a rugged
 strength there was in it,.
---
; the men were dropping off homeward one by one.

---
The last to leave was a round- shouldered, blinking young man of nineteen
 or twenty
---
Henchard called aloud to him,"
---
as
 he went out of the gate
---
Whittle turned, and."
---
Yes, sir," he said, in
 breathless deprecation,.


---
as if he knew
---
Then Abel Whittle left, and
---
Henchard and Farfrae; and
 Elizabeth saw no more of them.


---
Now there was good reason for this command on Henchard's part.
---
as he was called
---
Poor
 Abel,, had an inveterate habit of over- sleeping himself
 and.
---
His anxious will was; but
---
if his comrades omitted and
---
that he always
 tied round his great toe
---
to pull the string left hanging out the window for that
 purpose, his will was as wind.
---
He did not arrive in time.


---
As he was often second hand at the hay- weighing, or at the crane which
 lifted the sacks, or
---
was one of those to accompany the waggons
 into the country to fetch away stacks, this
 affliction of Abel's was productive of much inconvenience.
---
For two
 mornings in the present week he had kept the others
---
there was no Whittle.
---
At half- past six Henchard
 entered the yard
---
that Abel was; and

---
the other man had been waiting twenty minutes
---
Then Henchard swore, and

---
Whittle coming up breathless at that instant
---
, the corn- factor turned on
 him, and.


---
if he
 were behind once more, by God
---
; that, he would come and
---
" said Abel,
" especially in the inside,
---
just afore I'd got man's wages, for no sooner
---
" But let, your worshipful----"

 Henchard turned away.

"
---
He asked me and
---
he questioned me, and!
---
" said Abel, to the yard in general.
---
Now, I shall twitch like a
 moment- hand all night to- night for fear o' him!"


---
But Abel was missing.
---
Before either of the other men could run to Abel's
 and.
---
Henchard appeared in the garden doorway
---
" Where's Abel
 Whittle?
---
Henchard went off,.
---
Reaching Whittle's bedside the corn- factor shouted a
 bass note
---
that Abel started up instantly, and
---
which had not much relation to getting on his clothes
---
The unhappy Whittle threw on his sleeve waistcoat, and.
---
while Henchard thrust his
 hat over his head
---
Whittle then trotted on down Back Street
---
, Henchard
 walking sternly behind.


---
who had been to Henchard's house
---
Just at this time Farfrae, to look for
 him, came out of the back gate, and.

"
---
which he soon perceived
---
that showed below his waistcoat
---
said Farfrae,.


---
Henchard being some way in the rear by this time
---
Ye see, Mr. Farfrae
---
"," gibbered Abel with a resigned smile of terror,
" he said!
---
he'd mortify my flesh
---
now
 he's a- doing on't
---
it ca n't be helped, Mr. Farfrae
---
since he do command
---
Mr. Henchard said----"

" I do n't care nor anybody else!'
---
what Mr. Henchard said,
---
" Hullo, hullo!" said Henchard,.
---
" Who's sending him
 back?"


---
All the men looked towards Farfrae.


---
"," said Donald.
---
"," said Farfrae.
---
" He either goes home, or
---
Henchard looked at him with a face stern and red.
---
But he paused for
 a moment, and
---
Donald went up to him,.


---
for he saw in
 Henchard's look
---
that he began
---
" Come," said Donald quietly!
---
," a man o' your position should ken better,
 sir
---
"' Tis not tyrannical!" murmured Henchard, like a sullen boy.
---
him remember
---
He presently added, in a tone of?
---
," said Farfrae simply.


---
Henchard looked on the ground,.

---
that Henchard had kept Abel's
 old mother in coals and
---
which made him
 less antagonistic to the corn- factor
---
But Henchard continued moody and
 silent, and
---
when one of the men inquired of him
---
, he said shortly,"
---
He's master here!"


---
Morally he was
---
Henchard, hitherto been the most admired man in his circle
---
" Very well," he said.
---
" But please will Mr. Farfrae come?"
---
Why Mr. Farfrae?" said Henchard, with the fixed
 look of thought.
---
" Why do people always want Mr. Farfrae?"


---
because they like him so
---
They like him
---
because he's
 cleverer than Mr. Henchard, and
---
because he knows more; and, in short
---
,
 Mr. Henchard ca n't hold a candle to him-- hey?"


---
And he's
---
Henchard's a fool to him
---
He's a
 diment
---
-- he's a chap o' wax
---
-- he's the best
---
-- he's the horse for my money,
---
He's the most understanding man o'
---
he was the master instead of Henchard
---
"

," Henchard replied with covered gloom.
---
The
 boy departed, and
---
Henchard murmured,""


---
he were master here,
---
He went towards Durnover.
---
On his way he overtook Farfrae.
---
Donald inquired.


---
"," said Henchard.


---
As Henchard did not reply till, getting near the bereaved people's door
---
Donald practised a piece of music sotto voce,
, he stopped himself with--

".
---
as their father is dead
---
observed
 Henchard with a half sneer.
---
The cloud lifted from Henchard's brow, and
---
as Donald finished
---
the
 corn- merchant turned to him,.


---
," he said.
---
that were not very plain to him
---
On Henchard's
 part there was now again; and yet,
---
whenever he thought of
 Farfrae
---
he often regretted.





---
that he had

---
On this account Henchard's manner towards Farfrae insensibly became
 more reserved.
---
He was courteous-- too courteous-- and
---
Farfrae was.
---
which now for the first time
 showed itself among the qualities of a man he had hitherto thought
 undisciplined, if warm and sincere
---
The corn- factor seldom or never
 again put his arm upon the young man's shoulder.
---
He left off."
---
Then one
 day Donald Farfrae broached the subject to Henchard by asking.

"
---
if he
 would have any objection to lend some rick- cloths to himself and a few
 others, who contemplated getting up an entertainment of some sort on
 the day named, and
---
Have as many cloths," Henchard replied.


---
When his manager had gone about the business
---
Henchard was fired with
 emulation.
---
It certainly had been very remiss of him,.
---
as Mayor, he
 thought,
---
But Farfrae had been so cursed quick in his movements as
 to give old- fashioned people in authority no chance of the initiative.

---
he determined

---
on second thoughts to take upon his own shoulders the responsibility of organizing some
 amusements, if the other Councilmen would leave the matter in his hands.

---
So Henchard set about his preparations for a really brilliant
 thing-- such as.
---
As for Farfrae's
 little affair, Henchard nearly forgot it; except once now and then when,
 on it coming into his mind, he said to himself," Charge admission at
 so much a head-- just like
---
He had grown so dependent upon Donald.
---
that he could scarcely resist

---
he refrained
---
No,
 he thought,.


---
Farfrae would be suggesting such improvements in his damned
 luminous way that in spite of himself he, Henchard, would sink to the
 position of second fiddle, and
---
that he meant
---
He advertised about the town, in long posters of a pink colour,.
---
Moreover, not forgetting his principles, Henchard provided a
 mammoth tea, of which everybody who lived in the borough was invited to
 partake without payment.
---
He was easy in his mind now, for his own preparations.


---
Henchard wished.
---
he had not
 been quite so sure about the continuance of a fair season
---
A number of people had heroically gathered in the field but by three
 o'clock Henchard.
---
that his project was doomed
---
" said Henchard,
---
after the lapse of
 half- an- hour, during which time only two men and a woman had stood up to
 dance."
---
They are at Farfrae's affair in the West Walk
---
" Then the more fools they!"

 Henchard walked away moodily.
---
the whole scene presented the most melancholy
 appearance Henchard gave orders that the proceedings were to be
 suspended, and the entertainment closed
---
Henchard returned to his house,.
---
He soon saw.
---
The notes of a stringed band came from the
 enclosure that Farfrae had erected-- the pavilion as he called it-- and

---
he perceived.
---
Henchard went round and.


---
the usually sedate Farfrae was in the midst of
 the other dancers in the costume of a wild Highlander,.
---
For a moment Henchard could not help
.
---
Then he perceived the immense admiration for the Scotchman
 that revealed itself in the women's faces; and
---
when this exhibition was
 over, and a new dance proposed, and Donald had disappeared for a time to
 return in his natural garments
---
, he had an unlimited choice of partners,
 every girl being in a coming- on disposition towards one who so
 thoroughly understood the poetry of motion as he.


---
Henchard walked and.
---
He did not care and
---
when he went into the dark
---
he heard
 remarks of a kind which were becoming too frequent:


---
" Mr. Henchard's rejoicings could n't say good morning to this
---
" A man must be a headstrong stunpoll."


---
" Where would his business be?'
---
Twas verily Fortune sent him to
 Henchard.
---
His accounts were like a bramblewood when Mr. Farfrae came.

---
He used.
---
But now this accomplished young man does it all by ciphering and
 mensuration.
---
Farfrae has a plan for purifying,
---
O yes, everybody
 is full of him, and
---
" But he wo n't do it for long
---
No!" said Henchard to himself behind the tree.
---
if he do
---
" Or, he'll be
 honeycombed clean out of all the character and!"


---
that he's built
 up in these eighteen year
---
He went back to the dancing pavilion.
---
Farfrae was footing a quaint
 little dance with Elizabeth- Jane-- an old country thing, the only one she
 knew, and though he considerately toned down his movements to suit her
 demurer gait, the pattern of the shining little nails in the soles of
 his boots became familiar to the eyes of every bystander.
---
Mr. Farfrae had said, and.


---
that it was very popular
 in his own country
---
he did not give it
---
He seemed.
---
, Farfrae," he
 said,
---
He
 planted on Donald an antagonistic glare that had begun as a smile.


---
Donald drew aside.
---
You see, Mr. Henchard
---
You should have
 taken a leaf out of his book, and.
---
he did, and

---
where he's beat you
---
" He'll be top- sawyer soon of you two, and
---
carry all afore him," added
 jocular Mr. Tubber.


---
No," said Henchard gloomily.
---
" He wo n't be that,."
---
because he's
---
He looked towards Donald, who had come near."
---
who could now read the lines and folds of Henchard's
 strongly- traced face, quietly

---
The young man, assented; and
---
asked, he
 simply replied.


---
that Mr. Henchard no longer required his help
---
Henchard went home, apparently satisfied.
---
when his
 jealous temper had passed away
---
But in the morning,, his heart sank within him at what he had
.
---
He was the more disturbed.





---
when he found that this time
 Farfrae was determined to take him at his word
---
Elizabeth- Jane had perceived from Henchard's manner.
---
A man followed in a few minutes, and her face being to- wards the shine
 from the tent he recognized her.
---
It was Farfrae--.


---
which had signified his dismissal
---
Miss Newson?--and"
  he said,
---
till Farfrae said,
---
I offended your father by
 getting up this
---
perhaps he had heard her after all:

", Miss Newson; and
---
What he would have asked her.
---
he did not say, and
---
"," said Donald, in his undulating tones.
---
," said
 Donald Farfrae.
---
; lest it make your father more angry still."


---
Farfrae returning into the dark Bowling Walk, and

---
what he fain
---
how he was rising in favour among
 the townspeople
---
that
 Farfrae's days as manager were numbered,
---
Would Mr. Farfrae stay in Casterbridge despite his
 words and her father's dismissal?
---
His occult breathings to her might be
 solvable by his course in that respect.


---
The next day was windy-- so windy that walking in the garden she picked
 up a portion of the draft of a letter on business in Donald Farfrae's
 writing, which had flown over the wall from the office.
---
The letter began" Dear Sir," and
---
that Farfrae and Henchard had

---
if Farfrae were going away from the town
---
that he was not going
---
A man
 following the same trade as Henchard, but on a very small scale, had

---
who was forthwith about to start as corn
 and hay merchant on his own account
---
that he meant; and
---
yet, would a man have endangered his suit by setting up a business in opposition
 to Mr. Henchard's?
---
and it must have been a passing impulse
 only which had led him to address her so softly.


---
that by this time he had discovered
---
her heart going out to him
---
who had been hurt at finding that Farfrae did not mean to
 put up with his temper any longer
---
Henchard,, was incensed beyond measure.
---
when
 he learnt
---
what the young man had done as an alternative
---
that he first became aware of
 Farfrae's coup for establishing himself independently in the town; and

---
his voice might have been heard as far as the town- pump expressing his
 feelings to his fellow councilmen
---
though under
 a long reign of self- control he had become Mayor and churchwarden and
 what not
---
that,, there was still the same unruly volcanic stuff beneath the
 rind of Michael Henchard
---
as when he had sold his wife at Weydon Fair
---
" Well, he's a friend of mine, and
---
I'm a friend of his-- or,

---
if I've not been his friend, who has, I should
 like to know?
---
Did n't he come here without a sound shoe to his voot?

---
Did n't I keep him here--?
---
Did n't I help him to
 money, or?
---
whatever he wanted
---
, I liked him so well.
---
And now he's defied me!
---
But damn him,
 I'll have a tussle with him now-- at fair buying and selling, mind-- at
 fair buying and selling!
---
as he,
 then I'm not wo'th a varden!
---
His friends of the Corporation did not specially respond.
---
Henchard was
 less popular now than he had been.
---
when nearly two years before, they
 had voted him to the chief magistracy on account of his amazing
 energy
---
So he went out of the hall and down the street alone.


---
Reaching home he seemed.

---
He called Elizabeth- Jane.
---
how he looked
---
"," he said,.
---
That man, Farfrae-- it is about him.
---
him talking to you two or three times
---
-- he danced with' ee at the
 rejoicings, and
---
But just
 harken: Have you made him any foolish promise?
---
you not to see him
 again
---
He's an enemy to our house!"


---
he sat down, and
---
Henchard to have had policy
---
that no better modus vivendi could be arrived at with Farfrae than by
 encouraging him to become his son- in- law
---
With all domestic finesse of that kind he was hopelessly at
 variance.
---
Loving a man or hating him, his diplomacy was as wrongheaded
 as a buffalo's; and
---
Meanwhile Donald Farfrae had opened the gates of commerce on his own
 account at a spot on Durnover Hill-- as far as possible from Henchard's
 stores, and with every intention of keeping clear of his former friend
 and employer's customers.
---
, it seemed to the younger man, room
 for both of them and.
---
with his native sagacity he saw
 opportunity for a share of it.


---
So determined was he--.


---
that he refused his first customer-- a
 large farmer of good repute
---
because Henchard and this man had dealt
 together within the preceding three months
---
He was once my friend," said Farfrae," and
---
for me to take
 business from him
---
I can not hurt the
 trade of a man who's been so kind to me."


---
that his northern energy was an overmastering force
 among the easy- going Wessex worthies, or
---
whatever he touched
---
that he prospered in
---
Like Jacob
 in Padan- Aram, he would no sooner humbly limit himself to
 the ringstraked- and- spotted exceptions of trade than.


---
Farfrae's character was just the reverse of Henchard's,
 who might not inaptly be described as Faust has been described-- as a
 vehement gloomy being who had quitted the ways of vulgar men without
 light to guide him on a better way.


---
Farfrae duly received the request to discontinue attentions to
 Elizabeth- Jane.
---
His acts of that kind had been so slight that the
 request was almost superfluous.
---
Yet he had felt a considerable interest
 in her, and.
---
after some cogitation he decided
---
as he might
---
,
 Farfrae was compelled, in sheer self- defence,
---
He could no longer parry the fierce attacks
 of the latter by simple avoidance.
---
Northern insight matched against Southern doggedness-- the dirk
 against the cudgel-- and Henchard's weapon was one which, if it did not
 deal ruin at the first or second stroke,
---
Donald was always ready, and even anxious,, but
---
the Mayor invariably gazed stormfully past him,
 like one who had endured and lost on his account, and; nor.
---
Henchard was stung into
 bitterness
---
; like Bellerophon, he wandered away from the crowd,.


---
From that day Donald Farfrae's name was seldom mentioned in Henchard's
 house.
---
her husband would say," What
---
Henchard,, except in moments of irritation, sent at once for the
 richest, busiest doctor, whom he supposed to be the best.
---
Henchard sat down alone.
---
He was startled to see
 a letter for him from Jersey in a writing he knew too well, and.
---
He took it up in his hands and; and
---
then he
 read it as an unimportant finale to conjecture.


---
for any further communications to proceed between them now that
 his re- marriage had taken place
---
That such reunion had been the only
 straightforward course open to him.



---
that he had in his mind
---
The contingency was, of course, the death of
 Mrs. Henchard.


---
As requested, he sealed up Lucetta's letters, and
---
He would have preferred;
 but
---
,
 he went at dusk and.


---
Henchard crossed over to
 it; but
---
he gave the matter up and
---
Meanwhile Mrs. Henchard was weakening visibly.
---
the first
 sparrow shook himself,
---
Without preface, and as the
 continuation of a scene already progressing in her mind, Mrs. Henchard
 said:?"


---
you to marry Mr. Farfrae
---
Henchard hates him."


---
Some little time later on Farfrae was passing Henchard's house on a
 Sunday morning,.
---
when he observed
---
He rang
 the bell so softly that it only sounded a single full note and a
 small one; and
---
then he was informed-- just
 dead-- that very hour.


---
that Mrs. Henchard was dead
---
when he passed a few old
 inhabitants, who came there for water whenever they had, as at present,
 spare time
---
Mrs. Cuxsom,, was describing the incidents of
 Mrs. Henchard's death,.

"
---
that man, Christopher Coney, went and
---
Faith,' he said,'?
---
,' says he.
---
" Gad, then I wo n't quite ha'e it," said Solomon Longways.
---
Henchard and Elizabeth sat.
---
three weeks
 after Mrs. Henchard's funeral, the candles were not lighted,
---
"?" said Henchard.


---
Henchard always looked like one bent on resisting pain when
 Elizabeth- Jane spoke of Richard Newson as" father."
---
I am out of all
 that, am I not?" he said...." Was Newson a kind father?"


---
Henchard's face settled into an expression of stolid loneliness which
 gradually modulated into something softer.
---
I had been your real
 father
---
" Suppose?" he said.
---
" Would you have cared for me as much as you cared for
 Richard Newson?"


---
" I can think of no other as my
 father, except my father."


---
dissevered from him by death; his friend and helper
 Farfrae by estrangement; Elizabeth- Jane by ignorance.
---
It seemed to him
.

---
His mind began.
---
till he could no longer sit still
---
He
 walked up and down, and
---
then he came and.
---
He could no longer restrain his impulse.

---
" he asked.


---
Elizabeth, it is I who am your father, and
 not Richard Newson.
---
Henchard went on
---
-- Newson became her husband.
---
"

 This was the nearest approach Henchard could make to the full truth.
---
as he personally was
---
he would have screened nothing
---
As
 far concerned;
 but he showed a respect for the young girl's sex and years worthy of a
 better man.


---
When he had gone on
---
his story to be true
---
said Henchard, with vehement pathos,".
---
I am your father
---
he cried,.
---
though I was a
 drinking man once, and
---
than HE was
---
if you will only look upon me as your
 father
---
," said Henchard in
 jerks, and moving like a great tree in a wind.
---
He went out at the door and.
---
him go
 away into the garden
---
But he had not done.
---
in
 any way recovered from the effect of his disclosure, he reappeared.


---
" One word more, Elizabeth," he said.
---
which he had evidently got by heart from some
 advertisement or other-- words to the effect that she, the writer,
 hitherto known as Elizabeth- Jane Newson
---
Now," said Henchard,.
---
that he always
 emitted
---
when he had carried his point--
---
He was gone before.
---
Henchard in the meantime had gone upstairs.
---
he kept in a drawer in his bedroom,
---
this he unlocked.
---
Before turning
 them over he leant back and.
---
He was the kind of man to whom some
 human object for pouring out his heart upon--
---
The craving for his heart for the
 re- establishment of this tenderest human tie had been great during
 his wife's lifetime, and
---
now he had submitted to its mastery without
 reluctance and without fear.
---
He bent over the drawer again, and
.


---
, the keys of which had been handed to him at her request.
---
Here was
 the letter addressed to him with the restriction," NOT TO BE OPENED TILL
 ELIZABETH- JANE'S WEDDING- DAY."


---
Mrs. Henchard, though more patient than her husband, had been no
 practical hand at anything.
---
Henchard had no reason to suppose the restriction one of serious weight,
 and his feeling for his late wife."
---
," he
 said;
---
and without curiosity he allowed MY DEAR MICHAEL,--For the good of all three of us
---
his eyes to scan the letter:--



---
this living one is my other
 husband's.
---
Her husband regarded the paper.
---
through
 which he saw for miles
---
His lips twitched, and
---
he seemed.
---
His usual habit was not
---
whether
 destiny were hard upon him or not-- the shape of his ideals in cases of

---
what he had

---
the girl's name altered from
 Newson to Henchard
---
His wife's extreme reluctance to have was now accounted for fully.
---
He remained unnerved and purposeless for near a couple of hours
---
; till he
 suddenly said,!"


---
He jumped up in an impulse,.
---
where he put his ear to
 the keyhole and
---
Henchard softly
 turned the handle,.
---
he held it in such a manner
---
He steadfastly regarded her features.


---
In sleep there come to the surface buried genealogical facts, ancestral
 curves, dead men's traits, which the mobility of daytime animation
 screens and overwhelms.
---
In the present statuesque repose of the young
 girl's countenance Richard Newson's was unmistakably reflected.
---
He could
 not endure the sight of her, and.


---
He looked out at the night as at a fiend.
---
Henchard,
 like all his kind, was superstitious, and.
---
he could not help
---
If he had not revealed his past history to
 Elizabeth
---
he would not have searched the drawer for papers, and so on.

---
that he should have
---
than he discovered her
---
This ironical sequence of things angered him like an impish trick from
 a fellow- creature.
---
Like Prester John's, his table had been spread, and

---
He went out of the house, and
.
---
till he came to the bridge at
 the bottom of the High Street
---
Here he turned in upon a bypath on the
 river bank,.


---
, was, in truth, the corpse of a
 man, for the square mass formed the base of the gallows,.
---
where
 Henchard now walked the mob
---
The exaggeration which darkness imparted to the glooms of this region
 impressed Henchard more than he had expected.
---
The lugubrious harmony of
 the spot with his domestic situation was too perfect for him, impatient
 of effects scenes, and adumbrations.
---
It reduced his heartburning to
 melancholy, and
---
he exclaimed,"!"
---
He went
 on past the cottage in which the old local hangman had lived and died,
 in times; and.


---
, engendered by his bitter
 disappointment
---
For the sufferings of that night, he might well have been pitied.
---
He was like one who had
 half fainted, and.
---
In words
 he could blame his wife, but not in his heart; and
---
had he obeyed the
 wise directions outside her letter this pain would have been spared him
 for.


---
He was.
---
His daughter he had asserted
 her, and
---
But he was ill- prepared for the first step in this new situation.
---
he came into the breakfast- room Elizabeth advanced with open
 confidence to him and took him by the arm
---
( Henchard was glad that he had disguised matters
 here)," was very kind-- O so kind!"
---
;
" but that is not the same thing as being one's real father after all.

---
Henchard bent and kissed her cheek.
---
he had

---
it was no less than
 a miserable insipidity to him now that it had come.
---
His reinstation of
 her mother had been chiefly for the girl's sake, and
---
Of all the enigmas there can have been
 seldom one like that which followed Henchard's announcement of himself
 to Elizabeth as her father.
---
He had done it in an ardour and
---
an agitation
; yet, behold,
 from the next morning onwards his manner was constrained.


---
when he was rising from table,
---
"' Bide,'" he echoed sharply,"?"


---
He made no reply, and.


---
Here, Elizabeth- Jane," he said,.
---
: Henchard's creed was
---
nay, he believed.
---
, he reddened
 in angry shame for her, and,
---
as soon, Henchard broke
 out with,"!
---
that he became
 sorry a few minutes after
---
that he did not mean
---
But his passion had
 less terror for her than his coldness.
---
that he disliked her with a growing
 dislike
---
Not knowing his secret it was cruel mockery.


---
Nance accepted this offering thankfully at first; afterwards
 as a matter of course.
---
when Henchard was on the premises he saw
 his step- daughter enter the hay- barn on this errand; and,
---
, Mockridge meanwhile
 standing with her hands on her hips,.

"
---
said Henchard; and
---
" he said with suppressed
 passion.
---
Now these words were uttered loud enough to reach Nance inside the barn
 door, who fired up immediately at the slur upon her personal character.

---
"," said Henchard.


---
" Just ask her," said Nance,.


---
Henchard glanced at Elizabeth- Jane,
---
" he said to her.
---
Nance glanced triumphantly at Henchard, and
---
Henchard, however, said nothing about
 discharging her.
---
Unduly sensitive on such points by reason of his
 own past, he had the look of one completely ground down to the last
 indignity.
---
though it had never before reached
 his own ears
---
Convinced of the scathing damage to his local repute and position,, Henchard showed a positive distaste for the presence of
 this girl not his own,.
---
whenever he encountered her
---
He mostly dined with
 the farmers at the market- room of one of the two chief hotels,.
---
Could he have seen
---
he might have found reason to reserve his judgment on
 her quality.
---
whenever he passed the house
---
as for the young
 man, he seldom or never turned his head.


---
it being the inscription on Mrs.
 Henchard's tombstone
---
The stranger presently moved from the tombstone of Mrs. Henchard, and
.
---
that he was
---
that Farfrae was likely to become one of the
 Council
---
He had learnt by personal inquiry at the time that
 it was to Donald Farfrae--.
---
And to attach no great
 importance to the incident---- such was Henchard's haughty
 spirit.


---
that the simple thrifty deed was regarded as little less than a
 social catastrophe by him
---
which had changed his luck
---
That dinner at the
 King's Arms with his friends had been Henchard's Austerlitz
---
: he had had
 his successes since, but
---
his course had not been upward.
---
He was
---
as he had

---
the consciousness of this soured him to- day.


---
"?" he said to her with offhand laconism.


---
"" he thundered.
---
Meanwhile Henchard was sitting up,.
---
who did not belong
 to him,
---
when if he had allowed
---
them to go on he
---
At last he said to himself with satisfaction" Ah!
---
as
 he jumped up and
---
he'll think-- and no portion at all!"
---
He wrote as follows:--


 Sir,--On consideration.
---
He glanced up for a
 moment from a pocket- book in which he appeared to be making figures as
 he went;
---
whether or not he saw her
---
he took no notice, and.


---
he
 probably scorned her; and quite broken in spirit
---
He is living?"


---
Yes, he is living
---
" Is he not kind to you?"


---
" I've no wish to complain of him."


---
leery;--and he
 was angry with me
---
" That he is a
 hot- tempered man-- a little proud-- perhaps ambitious; but not a bad man."
 
---
Her anxiety not to condemn Henchard while siding with Elizabeth was
 curious.


---
And he has not even
 been unkind to me till lately--.
---
; for then perhaps my father might
 get
---
Wealth enjoys it" however vague his opinions of
 those accessories
---
Men had still quite recently been going in and out with parcels
 and
---
generations of Casterbridge
 boys had thrown stones at the mask,; and
---
that
 as he paused with his hand upon the latch
---
: the lamplight fell upon the
 face of Henchard.


---
Henchard passed in, as ignorant of her presence as she
 was ignorant of his identity, and.
---
Henchard's chiding, by begetting in her a nervous fear of doing anything
 definable as unladylike, had operated thus curiously in keeping them
 unknown to each other at a critical moment.
---
at the least a query on either side in one and the
 selfsame form: What could he or she possibly be doing there?


---
Henchard, whatever his business at the lady's house, reached his own
 home only a few minutes later than Elizabeth- Jane.
---
to
 broach the question of leaving his roof this evening; the events of the
 day had urged her to the course.
---
But its execution depended upon his
 mood, and
---
He showed no further tendency to be angry
---
; he
 showed something worse.
---
his coldness was such that it encouraged her to
 departure,.


---
" Father, have you any objection to?" she asked.

"
---
He
 would know that soon enough.
---
After a pause he said,?
---
" better be done properly," he added after a pause.
---
He seemed relieved to get her
 off his hands by this arrangement, and
---
" Your father is willing?"


---
" One is my father.
---
He rents that yard and barn."


---
Did you
 tell him
---
as he is so uncertain in his
 temper
---
that he may
 alter his mind
---
He has grown quite cold to me."


---
Now Henchard had not the slightest suspicion that Elizabeth- Jane's
 movement was to be so prompt.
---
when, just before six, he
 reached home and
---
his
 step- daughter, with all her little bags and boxes, getting into it
---
Hence saw a fly at the door from the King's Arms, and, he
 was taken by surprise.


---
" Well, well, have your own way," he replied.
---
He entered the house, and,
.
---
He had never been there.

---
Henchard had known nothing of these
 efforts.
---
He gazed at them,.


---
" Look here," he said, in an altered voice.
---
-- he never called her by
 name now--"don't
---
Father," she said,.
---
He nodded ever so slightly, as a receipt of her decision and no more.

---
" said Henchard, his face stilling.


---
He neither moved nor and
---
We go back for a moment to the preceding night, to account for
 Henchard's attitude.


---
At the hour, he had
.
---
he is a man, and a merchant,
 and a Mayor, and one who has the first right to my affections.


---
Henchard had already heard.
---
He said with a puzzled air to the first person he encountered,
"?"


---
" A lady of the name of Templeman sir," said his informant.


---
Henchard thought it over."
---
he said to himself
---
It was by no means with the oppression that would once have accompanied
 the thought that he regarded the moral necessity now
---
His bitter disappointment at finding
 Elizabeth- Jane to be none of his, and himself a childless man, had left
 an emotional void in Henchard.
---
that he unconsciously craved
---
In
 this frame of mind, though without strong feeling, he had strolled up
 the alley and into High- Place Hall by the postern.
---
He had gone on thence into the court, and
.
---
whom he saw
---
The man replied in the negative;.

---
Henchard went away,.


---
He was in this interested stage of the inquiry.
---
when he witnessed
 Elizabeth- Jane's departure the next day
---
On hearing there suddenly took possession of him the strange thought.
---
the same person, for he could
 recall
---
whom he had deemed somewhat a mythical personage
---
that in her season of intimacy with him the name of the rich
 relative had been given
 as Templeman
---
Though he was not a fortune- hunter, the possibility
 that Lucetta had been sublimed into a lady of means by some munificent
 testament on the part of this relative lent a charm to her image which
 it might not otherwise have acquired.
---
He was getting on towards the dead
 level of middle age,.


---
But Henchard was not left long in suspense.
---
He sat over his dining- table long and
 dreamily, and by an almost mechanical transfer
---
which
 had run since his estrangement from Elizabeth- Jane and Donald

---
who had given her time and her heart to him
 so thoughtlessly
---
On the
 whole he did not blame her.


---
" he said,
---
that he would like
---
He put on his hat and.
---
when he reached her door
---
The answer brought him
---
" he thought.
---
he took
 the refusal quietly.
---
Nevertheless he resolved."
---
" he said.


---
us follow the train of Mr. Henchard's thought
---
" As a girl I lived about in garrison towns and elsewhere with my father,
.
---
He was an officer in the army.
---
that there appeared no chance of her identification with the young
 Jersey woman who had been Henchard's dear comrade at a critical time
---
as he did not come
---
He moved about amid the throng, at
 this point lively as an ant- hill; elsewhere more reposeful, and broken
 up by stalls of fruit and vegetables.


---
Some men were well dressed; but
---
In fact, was ready money-- money insistently ready-- not ready next year like
 a nobleman's-- often not merely ready at the bank like a professional
 man's, but ready in their large plump hands.


---
that they were held by men from the cider- districts who came
 here to sell them, bringing the clay of their county on their boots
---
Behind one of
 the trees stood Farfrae,.

---
Henchard had come up,
---
her stepfather throw a shine into his eye which answered" No
---
Luckily Farfrae's figure was immediately covered by the apple- tree.


---
-- he's a wine merchant
---
Farfrae stood
 out quite distinctly now; but
---
Henchard had not called on Lucetta.
---
though he had

---
He must have been too busy.
---
He would come on
 Sunday or Monday.


---
It may at once be declared
 that Lucetta no longer bore towards Henchard
---
his why it should be postponed,
---
your father may call
---
he stands close by in the market- place with the rest
 of the corn- dealers
---
" He wo n't come."


---
He has taken against me
---
" Then is, of all places, the one he will avoid?"


---
if Henchard had such a rooted dislike for the girl
---
his delays had wearied
 her
---
Sentimentally she did not much care to see him--, but and, then that; next so that the
 light fell over her head.
---
till a man's step was heard on the stairs
---
The man before
 her was not Henchard.





---
He was years younger than the Mayor of Casterbridge; fair, fresh, and
 slenderly handsome.
---
He wore genteel cloth leggings with white buttons,
 polished boots with infinite lace holes, light cord breeches under a
 black velveteen coat and waistcoat; and
---
he had a silver- topped switch in
 his hand.
---
he said, in deprecating tones.
---
I
 inquired for Miss Henchard, and
---
said Mr.
 Farfrae,.


---
" Miss Henchard
 will be here directly."


---
which had awakened the interest of
 Henchard, and
---
that something about the young
 man-- that hyperborean crispness, stringency, and charm, as of a
 well- braced musical instrument, of Elizabeth- Jane and of the Three Mariners' jovial crew,
 at sight, made his unexpected presence here attractive to Lucetta.

---
He hesitated,.


---
Farfrae's sudden entry was simply the result of Henchard's permission to
 him to see Elizabeth.
---
if he were minded to woo her
---
At first he had taken
 no notice of Henchard's brusque letter; but
---
an exceptionally fortunate
 business transaction put him on good terms with everybody, and.
---
that he could undeniably marry
---
if he chose
---
He therefore forgave the Mayor his curtness; and this morning on his
 way to the fair.
---
he had called at her house,
---
where he learnt
---
He seemed in doubt how to answer, and
---
" he asked.


---
But," turning pleasantly to
 him-- I may look for you.
---
even if one does not want him
---
" And I from near Edinboro'," he murmured.
---
a man must live
---
where his money is made
---
O
 yes," he went on with ingenuous enthusiasm.
---
" You see that man with the
 drab kerseymere coat?
---
I bought largely of him in the autumn, and!
---
, I soon made
 five hundred pounds-- yes!"--(bringing down his hand upon the table, and
!"


---
he was)--"while the others by keeping theirs in
 hand
---
He was quite a new type
 of person to her.
---
At last his eye fell upon the lady's and their glances
 met.


---
" he exclaimed.


---
It was now Farfrae.


---
" he said simply.


---
"," he murmured.
---
And his mind could be seen
.
---
, that the curious double strands
 in Farfrae's thread of life-- the commercial and the romantic-- were very
 distinct at times
---
," said Farfrae,
---
" Ah, no, ma'am suddenly recalling himself.


---
who attracted the eyes of Lucetta and Farfrae by his
 stillness
---
He was evidently a chastened man.
---
The battle of life had been
 a sharp one with him, for,
---
, he was a man of small frame.

---
He was
---
that, approaching from
 behind, a person could hardly see his head
---
He had planted the stem of
 his crook in the gutter and.
---
which was polished
 to silver brightness by the long friction of his hands
---
He had
---
where he was, and
---
what he had come for, his eyes being bent
 on the ground
---
which
 had reference to him
---
but he did not hear them, and
---
when his skill laid open to him any farm for the asking
---
The negotiations were between a farmer from a distant county and the old
 man's son.
---
, the old man
 without the younger; and the son had a sweetheart on his present farm,
 who stood by, waiting the issue with pale lips.


---
"," said the young man with emotion.
---
But,
, I ca n't starve father, and
---
he's out o' work at Lady- day.' Tis
 only thirty- five mile."


---
when he pressed her hand; and

---
he would give the young man half- an- hour for his answer, and
---
Lucetta's eyes, full of tears, met Farfrae's.
---
His, too, to her surprise,
 were moist at the scene.


---
," said Farfrae.
---
perhaps I'll take the old man too-- yes
---
; he'll not be
 very expensive, and
---
doubtless he will answer my pairrpose somehow."


---
Farfrae went out, and
---
him speak to the group
---
Farfrae returned to her

---
Farfrae looked more serious,.
---
"," he said.


---
how to talk to ladies,
 ambitious or no," said Donald with grave regret.
---
Under this revelation of insight
 Farfrae again looked out of the window into the thick of the fair.


---
Have you seen young Mr. Farfrae this morning
---
He promised
; but never a sign of him:."


---
though he's mostly
 a man to his word
---
," murmured Farfrae.


---
But he still remained.


---
," exclaimed Farfrae.


---
He looked anxiously at the farmer who was seeking him and who just then
 ominously walked across to where Henchard was standing, and he looked
 into the room and at her.
---
" staying" he
 said.
---
"," said the Scotchman, with a
 simple, shamed, apologetic look for his weakness.
---
"
  he murmured.
---
As he went
---
he said fervidly.


---
till he was

---
while he from merely affording her a new
 form of idleness, had gone on
---
But her
 ups and downs, capped by her indiscretions with Henchard.
---
Farfrae was shown out.
---
that he had called

---
that he
 was conscious of her eyes
---
her heart went out to him for his
 modesty--.
---
he might be

---
He entered the market- house, and
---
And he's afraid he hasn't much time to
 spare
---
, he says.
---
I wo n't detain him to- day
---
Henchard had neglected her all these days, after
 compromising her indescribably in the past.
---
he could have done

---
when he found himself free, and herself affluent
---
Both stole sly glances out of the window
 at Farfrae's shoulders and poll.
---
His face, for, either
 through shyness, or not to disturb his mercantile mood
---
, he avoided
.


---
Donald Farfrae was in the minds of both as the innovator, for though not
 a farmer he was closely leagued with farming operations.
---
And as if
 in response to their thought he came up at that moment
---
as if he knew something about
 its make
---
The two watchers had inwardly started at his coming, and

---
His greeting had been somewhat dry and thunderous, and Elizabeth- Jane,
 embarrassed out of her equanimity,,"
---
This is the
 lady I live with, father-- Miss Templeman."


---
Henchard put his hand to his hat,.
---
which he brought down with a great
 wave
---
till it met his body at the knee
---
" Yes," Henchard replied; and.


---
he proceeded
---
" Oh, do n't ask me, ma'am!" said Henchard.
---
His eye caught Elizabeth- Jane's imploring face
---
and he stopped,
---
He turned.
---
which his
 stepdaughter fancied
---
A murmur
 apparently came from Henchard's lips in which she detected the words,
"
---
Henchard had by this time
 and
---
They could see behind it the bent back of a man who was
 pushing his head into the internal works to master their simple secrets.

---
The' Lass of Gowrie' from inside of a
 seed- drill-- what a phenomenon!"

 Satisfied at last with his investigation the young man stood upright,
 and
---
!" said Farfrae gravely.
---
"," observed
 Elizabeth- Jane, who felt herself at one with Farfrae in Bible- reading
 at least.
---
He that observeth
---
his words will not be to the point any more.
---
Donald admitted,."
---
his gaze fixing itself on a
 blank point far away
---
," he added apologetically.


---
he, becoming embarrassed and deferential at the
 sound of her voice
---
, though with Elizabeth Jane he was quite at his ease
---
which followed Farfrae
---
that he was much
 mixed that day, partly in his mercantile mood and partly in his romantic
 one
---
" I had occasion to speak to Mr. Farfrae the other day, and
---
so I knew him
 this morning."


---
Your father was distant with you
---
because he does not think
---
My mother's separation from my father was unfortunate for me.
---
For one thing Henchard had never
 returned to her the cloud of letters she had written and sent him in
 her first excitement.
---
The rencounter with Farfrae and his bearings towards Lucetta had made
 the reflective Elizabeth more observant of her brilliant and amiable
 companion.
---
her encounter Donald somewhere as if by chance-- saw.
---
him wear with an added intensity
---
You've seen Mr. Farfrae
---
what he had said
---
" This person-- a lady-- once admired a man much-- very much
---
He did not think so deeply of her.
---
But in an impulsive moment, purely out of reparation, he
 proposed.
---
that he could
 not altogether be blamed for what had happened
---
he came."


---
-- that he
 was not and
---
that rendered him less desirable
 as a husband
---
him to be
---
The next phase of the supersession of Henchard in Lucetta's heart was
 an experiment in calling on her performed by Farfrae with some apparent
 trepidation.
---
Conventionally speaking he conversed with both Miss
 Templeman and her companion; but
---
Donald appeared, and

---
Susan Henchard's daughter bore up against the frosty ache of the
 treatment,.

---
The Scotchman seemed hardly the same Farfrae who had danced with her and
 walked with her in a delicate poise between love and friendship-- that
 period in the history of a love when alone
---
HE is
 the second man of that story
---
All this time Henchard's smouldering sentiments towards Lucetta had been
 fanned into higher and higher inflammation by the circumstances of the
 case.
---
He was discovering, the very being to make him satisfied with life.
---
for whom he once felt a
 pitying warmth which had been almost chilled out of him by reflection
---
Day after day
 proved to him, by her silence,
---
to think of bringing
 her round by holding aloof; so he gave in, and.


---
He crossed the room to her with a heavy tread of some awkwardness, his
 strong, warm gaze upon her-- like the sun beside the moon in comparison
 with Farfrae's modest look-- and with something of a hail- fellow bearing.
---
that he became deferential
---
He understood but.
---
her whom he had
---
him to recover balance
---
He looked her oddly in the face,.

"
---
," he said.
---
His voice slowly fell
---
; he was conscious
.
---
that in this room his accents and manner wore a roughness not observable
 in the street
---
He looked about the room at the novel hangings and
 ingenious furniture.

"
---
," he said.


---
he did not furnish one."
---
he
 went on
---
He turned to her with congratulatory admiration so
 fervid that she shrank somewhat, notwithstanding that she knew him so
 well.


---
Henchard showed chagrin
---
"," he said.
---
he said nothing to fill the gap for
 awhile,.


---
?" he said at last grimly,.


---
It was produced by the passing of a load of newly trussed hay from the
 country, in a waggon marked with Farfrae's name.
---
Beside it rode Farfrae
 himself on horseback.
---
A turn of the eye by Henchard, a glance from the window, and the
 secret of her inaccessibility would have been revealed.
---
But Henchard in
 estimating her tone was looking down so plumb- straight that he did not
 note the warm consciousness upon Lucetta's face.


---
he
 said emphatically.
---
He would not take it.
---
," he said drily, and
.
---
At going out he turned his eye upon her.


---
" to live in Casterbridge entirely on my account," he said.
---
He had hardly gone down the staircase.
---
" I WILL love him!"
---
;" as for HIM-- he's, and
---
Yet having decided to break away from Henchard one might have supposed
 her capable of aiming higher than Farfrae.
---
Donald Farfrae became
 every day.
---
On Farfrae's side
 it was the unforced passion of youth.
---
But, as regarded Henchard, this perception of hers also caused her
 some filial grief
---
he had made
---
that on a fine spring morning Henchard and Farfrae met in the
 chestnut- walk which ran along the south wall of the town
---
Each had just
 come out from his early breakfast, and
---
Henchard was reading a letter from Lucetta, sent in answer to a note
 from him,
---
Donald had no wish to enter into conversation with his former friend on
 their present
---
constrained terms; neither would he pass him in scowling
 silence.
---
He nodded, and
---
Henchard did the same.
---
when a voice cried" Farfrae
---
It was Henchard's, who
 stood regarding him.


---
"," said Henchard,
---
as if it were the presence of the
 thought and not of the man which made him speak
---
"," said Farfrae.


---
," said Farfrae heartily.


---
"," said Henchard, and.


---
That he had looked up from a letter.
---
Indeed,
 her present position was so different from that of the young woman of
 Henchard's story as of itself to be sufficient to blind him absolutely
 to her identity.
---
As for Henchard, he was reassured by Farfrae's words
 and manner against a suspicion which had crossed his mind.
---
that there was rivalry by some one he was firmly persuaded.
---
He could
 feel it in the air around Lucetta,.
---
when he had tried
---
he was more and more certain.
---
if they did not want him
---
To discover whose presence-- whether really Farfrae's after all, or another's-- he exerted
 himself to the utmost.


---
At the interview,, he made it a point to launch
 a cautious inquiry if she knew Mr. Farfrae.


---
" Pleasant young fellow," said Henchard.


---
We both know him
---
," said the corn- merchant to himself.
---
if it is he
---
In a few seconds surely enough Donald walked in.


---
which increased
 Henchard's suspicions without affording any special proof of their
 correctness
---
He was well- nigh ferocious at the sense of the queer
 situation in which he stood towards this woman.
---
who had reproached
 him for deserting her when calumniated
---
who had urged claims upon his
 consideration on that account, who had lived
---
who at the
 first decent opportunity had come by making her
 his
---
One, waiting for him, to ask him to rectify,, the false position;
 such she had been.
---
And now he sat at her tea- table eager to gain her
 attention, and.


---
Henchard took a
 slice by one end and
---
he was
 the man
---
Farfrae tried
; but
---
he was too much in love.

"
---
Henchard left the house with a ton of conjecture, though without a grain
 of proof,
---
that the counterattraction was Farfrae; and.
---
therefore he
 would not make up his mind
---
Yet to Elizabeth- Jane it was plain as the
 town- pump that Donald and Lucetta were incipient lovers.
---
But
 Henchard was constructed upon too large a scale.


---
which to him were as the notes of an
 insect that lie above the compass of the human ear
---
But he was.
---
The thus vitalized antagonism took the form of action by Henchard
 sending for Jopp, the manager originally displaced by Farfrae's arrival.

---
Henchard had frequently met this man about the streets, itself almost a proof that a man had reached a stage when
 he would not stick at trifles.


---
that
 his clothing spoke of neediness
---
that he lived in Mixen
 Lane-- a back slum of the town, the pis aller of Casterbridge
 domiciliation
---
Jopp came after dark, by the gates of the storeyard, and.


---
where Henchard sat in solitude

---
Jopp named his price,.


---
At this hour and moment, sir," said.
---
the sun had faded the shoulders of his coat
,
---
Jopp, to scarecrow green had regularly watched Henchard in the market- place,

---
which the still
 man has in his stillness of knowing the busy one better than he knows
 himself
---
Jopp too, had had a convenient experience
---
; he was the only one
 in Casterbridge besides Henchard and the close- lipped Elizabeth who knew
 that Lucetta came truly from Jersey, and but proximately from Bath.
---
"," he said.
---
possibly did not occur
 to Henchard.
---
Jopp said,"" and.


---
that at last he officially belonged to that spot
---
Now," said Henchard,.
---
who's taking the town trade so bold into
 his hands
---
," said Jopp.


---
By fair competition, of course," Henchard continued."
---
who had once ursurped his place
---
while it made him
 a willing tool
---
Jopp's dislike of
 Farfrae as the man,, made.


---
him, at the same time, commercially as unsafe a
 colleague as Henchard could have chosen
---
," he added,
---
" that he must have some glass that he
 sees next year in
---
He has such a knack of making everything bring him
 fortune."


---
" He's deep beyond all honest men's discerning, but
---
we must make him
 shallower.
---
We'll undersell him, and and."


---
that Jopp had been engaged by her
 stepfather
---
Henchard shut up her argument with a sharp rebuff.


---
The farmer's income was ruled by the wheat- crop within his own horizon,
 and the wheat- crop by the weather.
---
Thus in person, he became a sort of
 flesh- barometer, with feelers always directed to the sky and wind around
 him.
---
The local atmosphere was everything to him; the atmospheres of
 other countries a matter of indifference.
---
as men waiting in
 antechambers watch the lackey
---
backed by Jopp
---
Henchard,, read a disastrous garnering, and.
---
But before acting
 he wished--.
---
-- that he could know for certain what
 was at present only strong probability
---
He was superstitious---- and
---
he nourished in his mind an idea
 bearing on the matter; an idea he shrank from disclosing even to Jopp.


---
In a lonely hamlet a few miles from the town-- so lonely-- there lived a man of
 curious repute as a forecaster or weather- prophet.
---
The way to his house
 was crooked and miry-- even difficult in the present unpropitious season.

---
One evening so heavily an out- door man could be excused for
 shrouding himself to his ears and eyes,
---
till at length he reached the house,
---
Here he had always lived, and
---
he
 would die
---
He existed on unseen supplies
---
; for it was an anomalous thing that while
 there was hardly a soul in the neighbourhood but affected to laugh at
 this man's assertions, uttering the formula,"
---
Whenever they consulted him
---
When they paid him
---
He would have preferred more honesty in his clients, and less sham
 ridicule; but
---
fundamental belief consoled him for superficial irony.
---
As
 stated, he was enabled
---
to live; people supported him with their backs
.
---
He was sometimes astonished.


---
that men could profess so much at his house,
---
Behind his back he was called" Wide- oh," on account of his reputation;
 to his face" Mr." Fall.


---
The hedge of his garden formed an arch over the entrance, and
---
as if he were suffering from
 toothache
---
he could see the prophet within,.


---
He placed
 the candle on the corner of the dresser,.


---
as he could
---
Maybe so, Mr. Henchard," said the weather- caster.


---
He threw open the door and.


---
as he had declared
---
Henchard felt like Saul at his reception by Samuel
---
; he remained in
 silence for a few moments,
---
which he had hitherto preserved
---
he said,"....
---
" Then take this," said Henchard.
---
" O no, no," said Henchard.
---
Henchard would gladly have joined
---
that the meat, the onions, the pepper, and the herbs could
 be severally recognized by his nose
---
, he declined, and.


---
The next Saturday Henchard bought grain to such an enormous extent that
 there was quite a talk about his purchases among his neighbours the
 lawyer, the wine merchant, and the doctor; also on the next, and on
 all available days.
---
When his granaries were full to choking all the
 weather- cocks of Casterbridge
---
He was reminded of what he had well known
 before,.


---
that a man might gamble upon the square green areas of fields as
 readily as upon those of a card- room
---
Henchard had backed bad weather, and.
---
He had mistaken
 the turn of the flood for the turn of the ebb.
---
His dealings had been so
 extensive.
---
he
 was obliged
---
that he had bought only a few weeks before
 at figures higher by many shillings a quarter
---
he had

---
Thus he lost heavily.


---
In the blaze of an early August day he met Farfrae in the market- place.

---
Farfrae knew of his dealings() and; for since their exchange
 of words in the South Walk they had been on stiffly speaking terms.

---
though he did not guess
---
Henchard for the moment appeared; but
---
he suddenly
 took a careless turn.


---
" he cried with fierce gaiety."
---
And dammy, a man must be a fool to mind
 the common hazards of trade!"


---
But he had.
---
which
 had never before sent him there
---
It was rumoured soon after that much
 real property as well as vast stores of produce, which had stood
 in Henchard's name in the town and neighbourhood.


---
he encountered Jopp
---
The gloomy
 transactions just completed within had added fever to the original sting
 of Farfrae's sympathy that morning, which Henchard fancied might be a
 satire disguised so that Jopp met with anything but a bland reception.

---
The latter was in the act of taking off his hat to wipe his forehead,
 and saying," A fine hot day," to an acquaintance.


---
" My advice, sir, was."


---
Henchard continued his address to Jopp in similar terms.


---
till it
 ended in Jopp's dismissal there and
---
then, Henchard turning upon his heel
 and
---
You shall be sorry for this, sir; sorry as a man!"
---
" can be said Jopp,
 standing pale, and.





---
as he disappeared in
 the crowd of market- men hard by
---
Farfrae was buying.
---
As was
 usual, after reckoning too surely on famine weather the local farmers
 had flown to the other extreme, and( in Farfrae's opinion) just a trifle too much certainty
 upon an abundant yield.
---
So he went on
---
When Henchard had squared his affairs in a disastrous way, and
---
got rid
 of his burdensome purchases at a monstrous loss, the harvest began.

---
said Henchard.


---
If Henchard had only waited long
 enough
---
he might at least have avoided loss.
---
though he had not made a
 profit
---
But the momentum of his character knew no patience.
---
At this turn
 of the scales he remained silent.
---
The movements of his mind seemed.


---
that some power was working against him
---
," he asked himself with eerie misgiving;"
---
Even he could not admit.
---
that
 the perpetrator, if any, might be Farfrae
---
These isolated hours of
 superstition came to Henchard in time of moody depression,.


---
when all his
 practical largeness of view had oozed out of him
---
Meanwhile Donald Farfrae prospered.
---
He had purchased in.


---
so depressed a
 market that the present moderate stiffness of prices was sufficient to
 pile for him a large heap of gold where a little one had been
---
Why, he'll soon be Mayor!
---
"" said Henchard.
---
The rivalry of the masters was taken up by the men.


---
" said Farfrae's waggoner.
---
that
 Henchard's man was most in the wrong
---
, he therefore attempted.
---
the two men closed in
 a fight with their fists
---
Henchard
 came upon the spot
---
, somebody having run for him.


---
Henchard sent the two men staggering in contrary directions by collaring
 one with each hand,.
---
He then inquired into the circumstances; and

---
seeing the state of his waggon and its load began.


---
repassed by the forms of Henchard and the
 waggoners
---
, Mr. Henchard," she cried;" and
---
your man was most in the
 wrong!"


---
Henchard paused in his harangue and.
---
"," said he.
---
he must have been."


---
he
 could n't help it
---
" murmured Henchard's man.


---
that he is-- one that creeps into a maid's heart like
 the giddying worm into a sheep's brain-- making crooked seem straight to
 their eyes
---
" And that Mr. Farfrae is well aware of it?
---
He's sharp in trade, but
---
he
 would n't do anything."


---
before
 Henchard could reach it
---
for he had been sufficiently disturbed by what the man had said to
 wish to speak to her more closely
---
The Mayor's out o' town, is n't he?"


---
" He is, sir.
---
During those moments Henchard had determined, and
---
he knocked for admission.


---
he received
---
The answer was an expression of Miss Templeman's sorrow at
 being unable to see him again that evening.


---
Henchard walked away from the door to the opposite side of the street,
 and
---
stood by his hay in a lonely reverie, the constable having strolled
 elsewhere, and.
---
he entered the shadow of one of
 the projecting jambs which formed the thoroughfare to Bull Stake;
---
here
 he watched Lucetta's door.


---
almost at the moment Farfrae came round the opposite
 corner and.
---
he determined
---
Their shouts and laughter had reached Henchard
 at the Market House,
---
while he stood there, and
---
waiting he had little
 doubt from the turn which Farfrae and Lucetta had taken that they were
 bound for the spot.


---
Reaching the top of the lane Henchard crossed the shaded avenue on the
 walls.
---
He had entered at a point removed from the scene of immediate
 operations; but
---
he could
 see.
---
he
 therefore stepped into the hollow of the nearest shock, and.


---
which Henchard had never heard in full resonance of his lips
 before
---
And he the speaker?" said."
---
which Henchard lost
---
Farfrae seemed
---
that he would not, by taking her hand.


---
" convinced, Donald,," she presently
 said.
---
" not to live always in Casterbridge, for instance, upon
 finding?"

 Henchard did not hear the reply
---
; he might have done so and much more,
 but
---
he did not care.
---
He had some business with them, and,
---
though he entreated
 her
---
Henchard thereupon left the field and.
---
His state of mind
 was such that on reaching Lucetta's door he did not knock but.
---
he perceived.
---
that in his haste he had

---
He had.
---
for he soon heard
---
The light was so low that she did not notice Henchard at first.
---
as he, standing close to the edge of her gown
---
to hear it," said he.


---
The man is no better than I."

"!"
---
as he you would leave me
---
This unluckily aroused Henchard.
---
"," he
 said.
---
" And to be my
 wife, before a witness, I'll reveal our intimacy-- in common fairness to
 other men!"


---
Henchard saw its bitterness;
 and
---
had Lucetta's heart been given to any other man in the world than
 Farfrae
---
he would probably have had pity upon her at that moment.
---
But the
 supplanter was the upstart( as Henchard called him) who had mounted into
 prominence upon his shoulders, and
---
he could bring himself.


---
," he said,."
 
---
" Do n't be a no'thern simpleton!" said Henchard drily.
---
This promise will
 leave him free for you,
---
if you want him
---
," said Henchard.
---
",," said Henchard.


---
"," he said.
---
And taking up his hat he went away.


---
" You called my father' Michael'?
---
as if you knew him well
---
And how he has got this power over you,?
---
that the secret of
 Elizabeth's heart concerned the young man who had caused this damage to
 her own
---
how my father can command you so
---
; I do n't sympathize with him
 in it at all.
---
I'll go to him and."


---
The next morning Henchard went to the Town Hall below Lucetta's house,
.
---
In passing he looked up at her
 windows, but
---
But his rough
 and ready perceptions, his sledge- hammer directness, had often served
 him better than nice legal knowledge in despatching such simple business
.
---
his eyes
 still abstractedly stretching out of the window to the ashlar front of
 High- Place Hall
---
the offender stood before him.
---
Henchard
 looked at her, with a momentary pause,."
---
" he said,
.


---
" By the church, sir, of all the horrible places in the world!--I caught
 her in the act, your worship."


---
" Stand back then," said Henchard," and."


---
, the magistrate's clerk dipped his pen,, and.
---
Henchard
 being no note- taker himself
---
The constable waited, with his eyes on the clerk's pen,."
---
He paused,.


---
; for having got his evidence by heart it was immaterial to him
.


---
whereabouts he broke off
---
that twelve feet nine inches from a man on his oath was
 admissible
---
However, a little further
 Henchard broke out impatiently,"!
---
the clerk dipped his
 pen
---
But Henchard stared, and.


---
A man and a woman with a little child came into my tent
---
I did it for the man; and

---
then he had.
---
more and more; till at last he quarrelled with his wife, and

---
who sold his
 wife in that fashion
---
And the man is the man sitting there in the great big chair."
 
---
The speaker concluded by nodding her head at Henchard and folding her
 arms.


---
Everybody looked at Henchard.
---
His face seemed strange, and in tint as if
 it had been powdered over with ashes.
---
that he's no better than I
---
The words came from Henchard.
---
"' Tis as true as the
 light," he said slowly."
---
Henchard left the
 chair, and
---
that before he became a gentleman
---
he sold his wife for five
 guineas in a booth at a fair
---
which Henchard had given her of the separation from
 his wife Susan for so many years, of his belief in her death, and
---
In all the accounts so on,
 he had never clearly explained the actual and immediate cause of that
 separation.
---
At bottom, then, Henchard was this.

---
who should commit herself to his
 care
---
After two or three days of solitude and
 incessant rain Henchard called at the house.
---
He seemed disappointed to
 hear of Lucetta's absence and
---
though he nodded with outward indifference

---
he went away.


---
The next day he called again.
---
?" he asked.


---
to reveal his restless impatience,
 he left the house again.





---
Farfrae
 for once had been missed from his corn- stand in the dealers' room.

---
that he would be home that night--"for
 Sunday," as Casterbridge expressed it
---
who, facing the other way, did
 not observe him
---
Nothing was commoner than for a house- holder on going out of his
 parlour."


---
, he meanwhile drawing
 vaguely towards them
---
though disfigured at present by splotches of mud about
 his seamy sides
---
His horns were thick and; his two
 nostrils like the Thames Tunnel as seen in the perspective toys of yore.

---
which the bull with the motions
 of his head flung about like a flail
---
that the bull was an old
 one, too savage to be driven, which had in some way escaped, the staff
 being the means by which the drover controlled him and kept his horns at
 arms' length
---
he had

---
than he tossed his head and
---
in a second he dashed into the barn,

---
But knocking down the hurdle- stake in passing; the heavy door slammed behind
 him; and
---
By the time that his length would allow
---
him to turn and
---
the hot air
 from his nostrils blowing over them like a sirocco, and not a moment
 being attainable by Elizabeth or Lucetta
---
a man appeared
---
He ran forward towards the leading- staff,
.

---
as if he would snap it off
---
The man was seen in the partial gloom unhesitating.
---
He led the bull to the door, and
---
the light revealed
 Henchard.
---
He made the bull fast without, and
---
re- entered to the succour
 of Lucetta; for he had not perceived Elizabeth, who had climbed on to
 the clover- heap.
---
Henchard took her in his
 arms and.


---
"," he responded tenderly.
---
Henchard supporting Lucetta on one side, and Elizabeth- Jane on the
 other, they went slowly along the rising road.
---
Henchard had secured him by
 jamming the staff into the hinge of the barn- door, and wedging it
 there with a stake.
---
being driven by Farfrae
---
His presence here seemed.
---
Donald saw
 her,.
---
At
 Elizabeth- Jane mentioning, he
 exhibited an agitation different in kind no less than in intensity
 from any she had seen in him before.
---
He became.


---
that he scarcely had sufficient knowledge of what he was
 doing
---
?" he inquired at last.


---
He is taking her home.
---
Farfrae checked his horse's pace
---
He was thinking.
---
Henchard
 had saved Lucetta, and.


---
Farfrae did not whip on the
 horse.
---
When these reached the town walls Henchard and his companion
 had disappeared down the street
---
; Farfrae set down Elizabeth- Jane on her
 expressing a particular wish to alight there, and.


---
On this account he entered the house through his garden, and
---
going up to
 his apartments found them in a particularly disturbed state
---
, his boxes
 being hauled out upon the landing, and.
---
his bookcase standing in three
 pieces
---
"?" he said to the mistress of
 the house, who was superintending.


---
said Farfrae cheerily.
---
Thus speaking he went out by
 the front door and up the street.


---
During this interval Henchard and Lucetta had.
---
After Elizabeth's departure for the muff the
 corn- merchant opened himself frankly,,
."
---
," he said,
---
If I were a man I should not insist
---
Henchard remained in thought.
---
He had evidently not expected this.
---
"," he said.
---
" No, no!" said Henchard, almost in anger.
---
" I'm not the man to sponge on
 a woman,.
---
My great creditor is
 Grower, and
---
it is at his hands.
---
if at anybody's; while a
 fortnight's forbearance on his part would be enough to allow me to pull
 through
---
This may be got out of him in one way
---
-- known to him my intended to be quietly married
 in the next fortnight.--Now stop, you haven't heard all!
---
him have
 this story, without, of course, any prejudice to the fact that the
 actual engagement between us is to be a long one
---
:
 you could go with me to Mr. Grower and
---
We'll ask him.
---
He
 will willingly wait then.
---
At the fortnight's end I shall be able to face
 him; and
---
I can coolly tell him.
---
that
 is, the quarter- hour just before dusk, he did not at first observe the
 result of his own words upon her.


---
he said, with a deep reproach.
---
I could have told him as much myself, but."


---
he would not have

---
he burst out.
---
Because-- he was a witness!"


---
Grower was!"


---
I am already his wife.
---
Mr. Grower was a witness."


---
because he happened
---
Henchard stood.
---
" Married him?" said Henchard at length.
---
" My good-- what, married him
?"


---
I loved him so much, and
---
you might tell him of the past
---
I
 should lose Donald
---
if I did not secure him at once--
---
for you would carry
 out your threat of telling him of our former acquaintance, as long as
 there was a chance of keeping me for yourself by doing so
---
while he spoke
---
" said
 he.


---
he has told them, or else
---
Mr. Grower has
---
My-- he was detained at Port- Bredy to- day, and."


---
Then it is HIS WIFE'S life."


---
" Yes-- and he will be for ever grateful to you."


---
" I am much obliged to him.... O you false woman!
---
One word to this
 bran- new husband of, and blown to atoms!"


---
Farfrae's words to his landlady had referred to the removal of his boxes
 and other effects from his late lodgings to Lucetta's house.
---
whom, even in the exceptional
 circumstances, he was not the man to neglect
---
He
 had.
---
whilst
 he went across the country to a certain group of wheat and barley ricks
 a few miles off,
---
at which he might be expected
 the same evening
---
This accounted for her trotting out to meet him after
 their separation of four hours.


---
when he came on from his
 lodgings
---
what would, secured him
---
Half- an- hour after her arrival he
 walked in, and
---
?" he said thoughtfully.
---
" O no, indeed I do n't," Farfrae answered with, perhaps, a faint
 awkwardness.
---
Farfrae looked at her and.
---
He liked her all the better for the blindness.

---
" Arrange by all means," he said.
---
He was a widower,.
---
as he supposed
---
He had not
 heard of his first wife for many years.
---
the husband comes.'
---
But, Elizabeth- Jane,
 all this amounts to a new courtship of me by him
---
He turned out
---
who the man is
---
My father; and I say."


---
it is him or nobody for you
---
" Why, you HAVE married him!
---
He did treat my mother badly once in a moment of
 intoxication.
---
that he is stern sometimes
---
But you
 will rule him entirely
---
I was so desperate-- so afraid of being forced to
 anything else-- so afraid of revelations that would quench his love for
 me, that I resolved to do it offhand!"


---
" You-- have-- married Mr. Farfrae!"
---
" My husband is
 downstairs.
---
He will live here; and
---
I have told him."


---
Now the instant decision of Susan Henchard's daughter was.
---
Apart from her estimate of the propriety of
 Lucetta's conduct, Farfrae had been so nearly her avowed lover.


---
then
 Elizabeth- Jane called a man with a wheel- barrow; and.
---
They were in
 the street in which Henchard lived, and almost opposite his door.


---
A wonderful skill in netting of all sorts-- acquired in
 childhood by making seines in Newson's home-- might serve her in good
 stead; and
---
Whether Farfrae
 would sell his business and
---
whether he would show independence enough to stick to his trade in
 spite of his brilliant alliance
---
in four- and- twenty hours there was not a person in Casterbridge
 who remained unacquainted with the story of Henchard's mad freak at
 Weydon- Priors Fair, long years before.
---
he had made in
---
Had
 the incident been well known of old and always, it might by this time
 have grown to be lightly regarded as the rather tall wild oat, but
 well- nigh the single one, of a young man with whom the steady and mature
( if somewhat headstrong) burgher of to- day had scarcely a point in
 common.
---
the black spot of his youth
 wore the aspect of a recent crime.


---
On that day-- almost
 at that minute-- he passed the ridge of prosperity and honour, and.
---
how soon he sank
 in esteem.
---
Socially he had received a startling fillip downwards; and
---
,
 having already lost commercial buoyancy from rash transactions, the
 velocity of his descent in both aspects became accelerated every hour.


---
He now gazed more at the pavements and less at the house- fronts; more at the feet and leggings of men, and less into the
 pupils of their eyes with the blazing regard which formerly had made
 them blink.


---
when he
 walked about
---
It had been a bad year for others
 besides himself, and
---
whom he had trusted

---
the heavy failure of a debtor generously completed the overthrow of his tottering credit.
---
And now,
 in his desperation, he failed.
---
For
 this, one of his men was mainly; that worthy, in his great
 unwisdom, having picked over the sample of an enormous quantity of
 second- rate corn which Henchard had in hand, and removed the pinched,
 blasted, and smutted grains in great numbers.
---
the blunder of
 misrepresentation, coming at such a moment, dragged Henchard's name into
 the ditch.


---
The details of his failure were of the ordinary kind.
---
that it was a meeting
 of the Commissioners under Mr. Henchard's bankruptcy
---
that he was present in the hotel
---
His examination had closed, and

---
The appearance of Elizabeth threw him into a
 reverie,.
---
till, turning his face from the window, and towering above all
 the rest, he called their attention for a moment more
---
His countenance
 had somewhat changed from its flush of prosperity
---
" Gentlemen," he said," over and above the assets that we've been talking
 about, and.
---
, he took his gold watch from
 his pocket and
---
laid it on the table; then his purse-- the yellow canvas
 moneybag, such as was carried by all farmers and dealers--,
 and.
---
he drew back quickly for an instant,
---
given him by Lucetta
---
all,"
  he said.
---
The creditors, farmers almost to a man, looked at the watch, and at the
 money, and into the street;.

"
---
No, no, Henchard," he said warmly.
---
," said Grower, another creditor.


---
him keep it, of course
---
Henchard was.
---
than he cared,
 and
---
he turned aside to the window again
---
they had returned to him
---
' Tisn't
 mine by rights," he said to himself.
---
Moved by a recollection he
 took the watch to the maker's just opposite
---
to whom he handed the money.


---
that Henchard had owned, and
---
that Henchard's whole career was pictured distinctly to his neighbours
---
how admirably he had used his one talent of energy

---
which
 was really all he could show when he came to the town as a journeyman
 hay- trusser, with his wimble and knife in his basket
---
; he did not reply.
---
Henchard was.
---
The ex- Mayor had left the home
 of his prosperity, and-- the
 sad purlieu to which he had wandered on the night of his discovery.
---
gone into Jopp's cottage by the Priory Mill
---
In this cottage he occupied a couple of rooms, Jopp, whom Henchard
 had employed, abused, cajoled, and,.
---
By nobody-- at present: that's his order
---
that he ruled there
 no longer
---
Abel Whittle was edging his skeleton in at the wicket, and
---
Mr. Farfrae is master here
---
" Yaas, Miss Henchet," he said,"
---
Mr. Farfrae have bought the concern and
 all of we work- folk with it; and' tis better for us than' twas-- though
 I should n't say that to you as a daughter- law.
---
though' tis a shilling a week less I'm the richer man; for
 what's all the world if yer mind is always in a larry, Miss Henchet?"


---
which had remained in a paralyzed condition during the settlement of
 his bankruptcy
---
Henchard's stores,
, were stirred into activity again.
---
; since it had been no uncommon thing for desperate men to wrench
 the coping off and throw it down the river, in reckless defiance of the
 magistrates.


---
Jopp in his time of
 distress had often stood here
---
A man seen there
 looking thus fixedly into the river was pretty sure to be one whom
 the world did not treat kindly for some reason or other.
---
who saw him so, and
---
kept
 his back to the parapet to survey the passers- by, one in straits on this
 never faced the road,.


---
To this bridge came Henchard,.
---
as other unfortunates had come before him
---
,
 his way thither being by the riverside path on the chilly edge of the
 town
---
Here he was standing one windy afternoon when Durnover church
 clock struck five.
---
While the gusts were bringing the notes to his ears
 across the damp.
---
flat a man passed behind him and
---
Henchard turned slightly and
---
Jopp, his old foreman, now employed elsewhere, to whom,
---
though he
 hated him
---
, he had gone for lodgings
---
because Jopp was the one man in
 Casterbridge
---
Henchard returned him a scarcely perceptible nod, and
---
Jopp stopped.

"
---
He and she are gone into their new house to- day
---
," said Jopp.


---
Oh," said Henchard absently.
---
And starting up Henchard added," MY house of all
 others in the town!"


---
, it can do
' ee no harm that he's the man."


---
: he felt.
---
Farfrae,, had acquired possession of the
 house for the obvious convenience of its contiguity.
---
while he, their
 former tenant, lived in a cottage
---
Jopp continued:
---
He was bidding for no other than Farfrae all the
 while!
---
as he'd already got the
 lease
---
Surely he'll buy my body and soul likewise!"


---
" There's no saying he wo n't, if you be willing to sell."
---
while Henchard stared and
---
He was driving a gig,.
---
his direction being also
 townwards
---
Mr.
 Henchard?" came from it in the voice of Farfrae.
---
Henchard turned his
 face.


---
that he had guessed
---
rightly Farfrae told the man who accompanied
 him to drive home;
---
while he alighted and
---
"" he said.
---
Henchard withheld his answer for several instants, and.
---
," said Farfrae.


---
" Ha, ha, true!" cried Henchard,."
---
" Now listen to me,," said Farfrae,".
---
said Henchard scornfully.
---
Henchard started.
---
drawn by the unsuspecting Donald
 of himself under the same roof with Lucetta
---
" No, no," he said gruffly;."


---
," said Farfrae;" and.
---
Still Henchard refused.
---
"," he said.

---
when
 Henchard persuaded the young Scotchman
---
said Farfrae when they reached the middle of the
 town, where their paths diverged right and left.


---
"?" said Henchard.
---
Henchard was a little moved.
---
"" he
 said, in tones which showed the disquietude that the night shades hid in
 his face.
---
He shook Farfrae abruptly by the hand, and.
---
Farfrae saw.


---
him turn through the
 thoroughfare into Bull Stake and
---
Donald and Lucetta speeding in and out
 of their door with all the bounding enthusiasm of their situation
---
He was sitting up in the bed with a greatcoat round him, and
.
---
" Go away-- go away," he said.
---
to see' ee," he repeated.


---
He soon was well enough to go out; and
---
He no longer thought of emigration,
 and.
---
nothing to do made him more
 dreary than any other circumstance;
---
than he had held for some time, and
---
one day, with better views of
 Farfrae a sense that honest work was
 not a thing to be ashamed of
---
The having and, he stoically went down to Farfrae's yard
 and.
---
He was engaged
 at once.
---
This hiring of Henchard was done through a foreman,.
---
Farfrae
 feeling
---
While anxious to help
 him he was well aware by this time of his uncertain temper, and.
---
For the same reason his orders to Henchard to
 proceed to this and that country farm trussing in the usual way were

---
so that Henchard was
 often absent at such places the whole week long
---
Henchard had become in a measure broken in
---
, he came.
---
And thus the once flourishing merchant
 and Mayor and what not stood as a day- labourer in the barns and
 granaries he formerly had owned.


---
" he would say in
 his defiant way;"
---
But he looked a far
 different journeyman from the one he had been in his earlier days.
---
Then
 he had worn clean, suitable clothes, light and cheerful in hue; leggings
 yellow as marigolds, corduroys immaculate as new flax, and a neckerchief
 like a flower- garden.
---
Now he wore the remains of an old blue cloth
 suit of his gentlemanly times, a rusty silk hat, and a once black
 satin stock, soiled and shabby.
---
Clad thus he went to and fro, still
 comparatively an active man-- for he was not much over forty-- and saw
 with the other men in the yard Donald Farfrae going in and out the green
 door that led to the garden, and the big house, and Lucetta.


---
that
 Mr. Farfrae, already in the Town Council, was
---
when he heard of this one day on his way to Farfrae's hay- barn
---
He thought it over.


---
as he wimbled his bonds, and
---
the piece of news acted
 as a reviviscent breath to that old view of his-- of Donald Farfrae as
 his triumphant rival who rode rough- shod over him
---
A fellow of his age going!
---
" to be Mayor, indeed" he murmured with a
 corner- drawn smile on his mouth.
---
Here be I, his former master, working
 for him as man, and he the man standing as master, with my house and my
 furniture and my what- you- may- call wife all his own."


---
He repeated these things a hundred times a day.
---
During the whole period
 of his acquaintance with Lucetta he had never wished.
---
as he now regretted her loss
---
It was no mercenary
 hankering after her fortune that moved him, though that fortune had been
 the means of making her so much the more desired by giving her the air
 of independence and sauciness which attracts men of his composition.

---
It had given her servants, house, and fine clothing-- a setting that
 invested Lucetta with a startling novelty in the eyes of him who had
 known her in her narrow days.


---
He accordingly lapsed into moodiness, and
---
at every allusion to the
 possibility of Farfrae's near election to the municipal chair his former
 hatred of the Scotchman returned.
---
Concurrently with this he underwent
 a moral change.
---
It resulted in his significantly saying every now and
 then, in tones of recklessness," Only a fortnight more!"--"Only a dozen
 days!" and so forth,.

"
---
as he worked
 beside Henchard in the granary
---
Michael Henchard have busted out drinking after taking nothing for
 twenty- one years!"


---
for each man to strictly limit himself to half- a- pint of liquor
---
They were all exactly
 alike-- straight- sided, with two leafless lime- trees done in eel- brown
 on the sides-- one towards the drinker's lips, the other confronting
 his comrade.
---
Now the Three Mariners was the inn chosen by Henchard as the place for
 closing his long term of dramless years.
---
He had so timed his entry as to
 be well established in the large room by the time the forty church- goers
 entered to their customary cups.
---
The flush upon his face proclaimed
 at, and.
---
He was seated on a small table,
---
, a few of
 whom nodded to him
---
Henchard did not take the trouble and
---
his
 eyes rested on his stretched- out legs and boots.
---
" Yes," he said at
 length.
---
"," said Henchard.
---
" Hang Samuel Wakely's tune,!" said Henchard.
---
He took
 one of the psalters and.


---
Chancing to look out of the window at that moment he saw a flock of
 people passing by, and
---
Henchard's mouth changed a little, and
---
he continued.

"
---
," he said,
---
I gi'e ye the words:

       " His seed shall orphans be
---
;
         His vagrant children beg their bread
          .

        
---
His ill- got riches shall be made
          To usurers a prey;
        
---
all his toil shall be
           By strangers
---
that to his wants
           Their mercy will extend,
         Or
---
to his helpless orphan seed
           The least assistance lend
---
A swift destruction soon shall seize
           On his unhappy race;
        
---
And the next age his hated name
           Shall utterly deface."

"-- the Psa'am!" said.'
---
Whatever Servant David were thinking about when
 he made a Psalm that nobody can sing without disgracing himself
---
He slipped off the table,."
---
" Thank ye, thank ye," said Henchard in a softened voice,.
---
his eyes
 growing downcast, and his manner that of a man much moved by the
 strains
---
"," he went on in low tones,.
---
He knew!
---
what he was about
---
when he wrote
 that
---
There's the man we've
 been singing about
---
"," said Henchard.


---
"' Tis the man," repeated Henchard doggedly.

" Then," said the performer on the clarionet solemnly,
"!"


---
"," said Henchard triumphantly.
---
As for him,
 it was partly by his songs that he got over me, and....
---
I
 could double him up like that-- and
---
He laid the poker
 across his knee,.


---
Elizabeth- Jane went up to Henchard, and
.


---
By this hour the volcanic fires of his nature had burnt down, and.
---
having
 drunk no great quantity as yet he was inclined
---
Henchard walked blankly, like a
 blind man,
---
At length he said to her,".
---
I am a man to my word
---
If I
 do n't do for him
---
He
 has taken away everything from me, and
---
if I meet him
---
Henchard did not answer, and
---
till they had reached his
 cottage
---
that
 to caution Farfrae was almost her duty,
---
As on the Sunday, so on the week- days, Farfrae and Lucetta might have
 been seen.
---
when
 business would not permit him
---
that Farfrae should be thankful for such devotion
---
One day he answered her inquiry
 for his health by saying that he could not endure Abel Whittle's pitying
 eyes upon him while they worked together in the yard."
---
He is such a
 fool
---
," said Henchard,"."


---
that he can never get out of his mind the time
 when I was master there
---
Henchard's threats had alarmed her
 so much that she wished to see his behaviour when the two were face to
 face.


---
For two or three days after her arrival Donald did not make any
 appearance.
---
through came,
 first Farfrae, and at his heels Lucetta
---
Donald brought his wife forward
 without hesitation,.


---
that he had no suspicion whatever
 of any antecedents in common between her and the now journeyman
 hay- trusser
---
Henchard did not turn his eyes toward either of the pair,.
---
he twisted
---
as if that alone absorbed him
---
which ever prompted Farfrae
---
A feeling
 of delicacy, to avoid anything, led him.
---
where Henchard and his daughter were working
---
that
 Henchard had entered her husband's service
---
which the happy and busy Donald was too far off
---
"?" said Henchard,.


---
as if he had not heard
---
" O yes, good afternoon, ma'am," he replied,.
---
Henchard
 continued:."


---
he asked.


---
that the
 next morning a note was put into Henchard's hand by the postman
---
I am only too glad that you should
 have employment of my dear husband;
---
Henchard with fond savagery, holding out the note
---
He threw the letter into the
 fire.


---
Farfrae was always considerate to his fallen acquaintance;
 but
---
that he should not, by degrees,
---
Henchard saw
 this, and.


---
his taking other
 liquor
---
Farfrae being nearest the dizzy edge
---
her stepfather
 slowly raise his hand to a level behind Farfrae's shoulders, a curious
 expression taking possession of his face
---
The young man was quite
 unconscious of the action, which was so indirect
---
if Farfrae had

---
, he might almost have regarded it as an idle outstretching
 of the arm
---
where he once
 had been master
---
Yet, on the
 other hand, his subordinate position in an establishment might be acting on him like an irritant poison; and
---
He could hardly discern her till,"


---
glancing inquiringly, he said,
" What-- Miss Henchard-- and?
---
" And I wished not to
 alarm Mrs. Farfrae by calling."


---
" Yes?" said he, with the cheeriness of a superior."
---
that he
 may be betrayed into some attempt to-- insult you, sir.


---
that he has been

---
that Farfrae
 was still incredulous
---
Henchard, a poor man in his employ, was not to
 Farfrae's view the Henchard who had ruled him.
---
Yet he was not only the
 same man, but
---
that man with his sinister qualities, formerly latent,
 quickened into life by his buffetings.


---
Farfrae, happy, and thinking no evil, persisted in making light of her
 fears.
---
But Donald Farfrae was one of those men upon whom an incident is never
 absolutely lost.
---
He revised impressions from a subsequent point of view,
 and
---
the impulsive judgment of the moment was not always his permanent
 one.
---
The vision of Elizabeth's earnest face in the rimy dawn came
 back to him several times during the day.
---
Knowing the solidity of her
 character he did not treat her hints altogether as idle sounds.


---
But he did not desist from a kindly scheme on Henchard's account that
 engaged him just then; and
---
when he met Lawyer Joyce, the town- clerk,
 later in the day
---
, he spoke of it.


---
" About that little seedsman's shop," he said," the shop overlooking the
 churchyard, which is to let.
---
It is not for myself for our
 unlucky fellow- townsman Henchard.
---
It would be a new beginning for him,
 if a small one; and
---
that I would head a private
 subscription among them to set him up in it--,
---
"," the town- clerk replied, in his plain, frank way."
---
Henchard hates' ee--
---
To my knowledge he was at the Three
 Mariners last night,."


---
about you which a man ought

---
" Why should he
 do it?"
---
added the young man bitterly;"?"


---
what harm have I done him
---
that he
 should try
---
" But I cannet discharge a man who was once a good friend to me.
---
that' twas he enabled me'
---
As long he shall do it.'
---
if
 he chooses
---
who will deny him such a little as that
---
But I'll
 drop the idea of establishing him in a shop."


---
It grieved Farfrae much.
---
, he went and
.
---
when
 Farfrae spoke to him and
---
Donald mentioned Henchard's name,
 and.


---
The occupier was much disappointed, and straight- way informed Henchard,
 as soon as he saw him,.
---
that a scheme of the Council for setting him up
 in a shop had been knocked on the head by Farfrae
---
When Farfrae got indoors that evening
---
whereupon Farfrae duly kissed her
---
that he looked serious
---
her eyes linger solicitously on his face
---
" he absently asked.
---
" Well-- nothing worth talking of," he responded sadly.

"
---
" No-- not always!" he said,.
---
as he contemplated
 a crumb on the table
---
There was
 Sandy Macfarlane, who started to America to try his fortune, and
---
he was
; and
---
Archibald Leith, he was murdered!
---
It's Henchard
---
-- he hates me
---
; so that I
 may not be his friend.
---
I cannet see a reason for the whole intensity
 of what he feels.
---
But neither can I blind
 myself to the fact that with a man of passions such as his, there is no
 safeguard for conduct!"


---
," declared Farfrae soothingly;
 though he did not know its seriousness so well as she.


---
Farfrae seemed seriously disposed, and
---
Farfrae was sorry at the intelligence, and
---
he's been going some days
---
as his family is well provided for

---
' ee to succeed him
---
said Farfrae after a pause
---
"," Farfrae murmured.
---
We have had older men
 long enough."


---
When he was gone
---
Farfrae said musingly,"
---
Henchard must rave."


---
as he will
---
" Michael," said?
---
He could not say.
---
-- he would consider
---
he recollected
.

---
that he had left a heap of useless papers in his former dining- room
 safe--
---
now occupied by Farfrae
---
A grotesque grin shaped itself on Henchard's face.
---
Farfrae was Mayor-- the two- hundredth odd of a series forming
 an elective dynasty dating back to the days of Charles
---
; what he could tell!


---
He, in the meantime, festering with indignation at some erroneous
 intelligence of Farfrae's opposition to the scheme for installing him
 in the little seed- shop
---
( which, by reason of Farfrae's comparative youth and his
 Scottish nativity-- a thing unprecedented in the case-- had an interest
 far beyond the ordinary)
---
: the
 ousting now seemed to him
---
The next morning he went to the corn- yard as usual, and
---
about eleven
 o'clock Donald entered through the green door, with no trace of the
 worshipful about him.
---
The yet more emphatic change of places between
 him and Henchard renewed a slight
 embarrassment in the manner of the modest young man; but
---
Henchard
 showed the front of one who had overlooked all this; and
---
Farfrae met his
 amenities half- way at once.


---
" to ask you," said Henchard," about a packet that I
 may possibly have left in my old safe in the dining- room."
---
He added
 particulars.


---
"," said Farfrae.
---
"-- to me," said Henchard.
---
when he fulfilled his promise
---
He had primed himself
 with grog, and
---
as he did very frequently now,
---
a curl of sardonic
 humour hung on his lip.
---
as he approached the house,
---
as though he were

---
Whatever it was, the
 incident of his entry.
---
this being his first
 visit to the house
---
since he had lived there as owner
---
The ring of the
 bell spoke to him like the voice of a familiar drudge who had been
 bribed to forsake him
---
Farfrae invited him into the dining- room, where he at once unlocked
 the iron safe built into the wall, HIS, Henchard's safe, made by an
 ingenious locksmith under his direction.
---
Farfrae drew thence the parcel,
 and other papers, with apologies for not having returned them.


---
Yes," he went on,
---
Mrs. Farfrae is well after her exertions of yesterday
---
Henchard returned to the letters,,
.
---
Farfrae being seated at the other end of the dining- table
---
of course," he resumed," that curious chapter in the history of
 my past which I told you of, and that you gave me some assistance in
---
" married well," said Henchard.
---
Farfrae, willing to humour Henchard, though quite uninterested, and
 bursting with yawns, gave well- mannered attention.


---
"' For me,'" Henchard read,
---
," said Henchard,"
---
Farfrae absently," it is the way wi' women
---
that he knew very little of the sex
---
he worshipped

---
yet detecting a sort of
 resemblance in style between the effusions of the woman and those of the supposed stranger, he concluded
---
Henchard unfolded another letter, and."
---
another man did
---
" Tr- rue, tr- rue," said Farfrae.
---
Farfrae asked this and the other questions in the
 comfortably indifferent tone of one whom the matter very remotely
 concerned.

" Ah--!"
---
said Henchard, the new- moon- shaped
 grin."
---
Henchard seemed, and
---
he answered" Yes."


---
"," said Henchard emphatically.


---
He opened a third and fourth letter, and.
---
This time he approached
 the conclusion.
---
But
 again he stopped short.
---
that, as may be divined, he had
 quite intended to effect a grand catastrophe at the end of this drama
 by reading out the name
---
, he had come to the house with no other thought
---
he could not do it.


---
Such a wrecking of hearts appalled even him.
---
His quality was such
 that he could have annihilated them both in the heat of action; but.





---
As Donald stated
---
The usual time for Donald's arrival upstairs came and
---
whoever he might be
---
Her own words greeted her in Henchard's voice, like spirits from the
 grave.


---
But
 her most was the tone of her husband.
---
He spoke merely in the
 accents of a man who made a present of his time.


---
," he was saying,
---
that
 Henchard was unfolding yet another sheet
---
Well, yes," said Henchard.
---
," said Farfrae,."
---
than he had hitherto done
---
As another man's wife it
 would injure the woman."


---
," murmured Henchard,.
---
Then he arose, and
---
Would
 Henchard let out the secret in his parting words?
---
he
 might possibly have got over it, and
---
for her or any one else to tell him now
---
her husband bolting it
---
After looking
 round in his customary way he came leisurely up the stairs.
---
when he appeared round the bedroom door
---
that he looked at her with the rallying smile of one
---
When he had restored her Farfrae.
---
Of
 all men he was the least desirable as a visitor
---
"," he said;" but
---
it is my
 belief that he's just a bit crazed.
---
He has been reading to me a long
 lot of letters relating to his past life; and
---
Henchard, then, had not told.
---
as he stood on the doorstep
---
Henchard's last
 words to Farfrae, in short,, had been these:
" Well-- I'm obliged to' ee for listening.
---
The bold stroke of telling Donald the truth, dimly
 conceived
---
" I overheard your interview with my husband last night, and.
---
Henchard came over the top,.

---
But having reached the arena: he stood
 still at a little distance from her
---
Her figure in
 the midst of the huge enclosure, the unusual plainness of her dress, her
 attitude of hope and appeal, so strongly revived in his soul the memory
 of another ill- used woman who had stood there and thus in bygone days,
 and.

---
that he was unmanned
---
his
 heart smote him for having attempted reprisals on one of a sex so weak
---
When he approached her, and
---
as he had come down
---
His manner had been one of cynical carelessness; but
.
---
he now put away his grim half- smile, and t'ye
---
"," he stammered with unconcealed
 compunction.


---
" What!" said Henchard uneasily.
---
Neither my
 husband nor any other man will regard me with interest long."


---
Henchard was disarmed.
---
His old feeling of supercilious pity for
 womankind in general was intensified by this suppliant.
---
; he felt ashamed,
 and.
---
Henchard was anxious to wash his hands of the game.


---
" he said gently.
---
But, between you and me,
 Lucetta, he is sure to find out something of the matter, sooner or
 later."


---
but not till I have proved
 myself a faithful and deserving wife to him, and
---
then he may forgive me
 everything!"


---
Henchard silently looked at her
---
: he almost envied Farfrae such love
 as that, even now."
---
," he said.
---
He reflected, and.
---
he would send them the next morning
---
" Now do n't
 doubt me," he added.
---
to go in he came and.
---
It was Jopp.


---
He begged her pardon for addressing her.
---
But he had heard
---
that Mr.
 Farfrae had been applied to by a neighbouring corn- merchant
---
; if so he wished.
---
He could give good
 security, and; but
---
he
 would feel.


---
said Jopp.
---
"," he persisted.


---
before her husband
 should miss her
---
He watched her and.
---
When he got
 there
---
he sat down in the fireless chimney corner and
---
A movement upstairs disturbed him, and
---
Henchard came down from his
 bedroom,.


---
where he seemed
---
"," said Henchard,.
---
He handed a package in brown paper,.
---
Henchard had been as good
 as his word.
---
he had searched over his few
 belongings
---
that he possessed
---
Jopp indifferently expressed his willingness.


---
"" his lodger asked.
---
"," said Jopp, who had not told the other of his
 application to Farfrae.


---
He said goodnight to Jopp, and returned
 to his own part of the house.


---
Jopp sat on.
---
till his eyes were attracted by the shadow of the
 candle- snuff on the wall, and
---
looking at the original he found
---
Henchard's
 packet next met his gaze.
---
He knew
---
there had been something of the nature
 of wooing between Henchard and the now Mrs. Farfrae; and his vague ideas
 on the subject
---
narrowed themselves down to these: Henchard had a parcel
 belonging to Mrs. Farfrae, and
---
he had reasons for not returning that
 parcel to her in person.
---
So he went on and on
 till,
---
animated by resentment at Lucetta's haughtiness, as he thought it,
 and
---
if there were any weak sides to this transaction
 with Henchard
---
, he examined the package.
---
The pen and all its relations
 being awkward tools in Henchard's hands he had affixed the seals without
 an impression
---
, it never occurring to him.
---
Jopp was far less of a tyro
---
; he lifted.


---
one
 of the seals with his penknife, peeped in at the end thus opened,
---
His path was by the river- side at the foot of the town.
---
Coming into
 the light at the bridge he beheld
.


---
Jopp had mostly kept himself out of this company, but
---
present
 circumstances made him somewhat more reckless than usual, and.



---
without
 many words he decided
---
when Henchard and Farfrae were Mayors
---
then, in a moment, he would vanish,.
---
pedestrian
 had edged into the slit by the adroit fillip of his person sideways;
 from the slit he edged into the tavern by a similar exercise of skill
---
we rolled down together, close to his
 garden hedge.
---
says he.
---
as
 we passed his wood, an hour afore
---
who presently asked Jopp
---
what
 was the parcel he kept so snugly under his arm
---
" Ah, therein lies a grand secret," said Jopp.
---
Getting a schoolboy to write ours for us; and giving him a
 penny, do ye mind, not to tell other folks what he'd put inside, do ye
 mind?"


---
By this time Jopp had pushed his finger under the seals, and.
---
which he read aloud
---
Mrs. Farfrae wrote that!"
---
said Nance Mockridge.
---
"," said Nance.


---
the landlady said to the
 man who had been called Charl,.
---
Without replying Charl and his comrade Joe rose, and.
---
the instant its further end
 touched the ground footsteps entered upon it, and there appeared from
 the shade a stalwart man with straps.
---
round his knees, a double- barrelled
 gun under his arm and some birds slung up behind him
---
They asked him.

"
---
if
 he had had much luck
---
Not much," he said indifferently.
---
"

 Receiving a reply in the affirmative he went on inwards, the others
 withdrawing the bridge and beginning to retreat in his rear.
---
" here's for through it! said the man in the moor.
---
that the man was no enemy
---
that's lost his
 way
---
He was a middle- aged man, with hair and whiskers
 prematurely grey, and a broad and genial face.
---
He had crossed on the
 plank without hesitation, and.

---
He thanked them, and."
---
" he asked,.

" A public- house."


---
They followed him into the inn, where the increased light exhibited him
 as one who would stand higher in an estimate by the eye than in one by
 the ear.
---
He was
---
dressed with a certain clumsy richness-- his coat being
 furred, and.
---
his head covered by a cap of seal- skin, which, though the
 nights were chilly, must have been warm for the daytime, spring being
 somewhat advanced
---
In his hand he carried a small mahogany case,
 strapped, and.


---
which confronted him through
 the kitchen door
---
Apparently surprised at the kind of company, he at once abandoned his idea of putting up at the
 house; but
---
, he called for glasses of the
 best,.
---
as he stood in the passage
---
" he asked.


---
" O, sir!" said the landlady, swinging her long earrings with deprecating
 modesty;"' tis a' old foolish thing they do in these parts when a
 man's wife is-- well, not too particularly his own.
---
He turned back,."
---
He threw a sovereign on the table and
---
, he
 took his leave.


---
Well," said Jopp;."


---
" said Nance.
---
Jopp gathered up the letters, and.
---
he did

---
He reached home,
.
---
that at last no evidence remained of the unlucky episode with Henchard
 in her past
---
A Royal Personage was about to pass through the borough on his course
 further west, to inaugurate an immense engineering work out that way.
---
He
 had consented.


---
he had rendered to agricultural science and economics,
---
that the sign- painter had in his shop
---
Henchard entered the room, in clothes of
 frayed and threadbare shabbiness, the very clothes which he had used to
 wear in the primal days when he had sat among them.


---
"," he said,,".
---
nearly
 ate the end of his quill- pen off, so gnawed he it during the silence.

---
who by virtue of his office sat in the large
 chair,
---
Farfrae the young Mayor, intuitively caught the sense of the meeting, and.


---
as he would have been
---
that it would be proper, Mr. Henchard
---
"," said he.
---
Farfrae looked round.
---
"," he said.


---
Henchard did not reply to that very obvious suggestion, and,,.


---
It had been only a passing fancy of his, but.
---
I'll welcome his Royal Highness, or nobody
 shall!
---
"" he went about saying.
---
to be sat upon by Farfrae,
 or
---
Solomon
 Longways, Christopher Coney, Buzzford, and the rest of that fraternity,
 showed their sense of the occasion by advancing their customary eleven
 o'clock pint to half- past ten
---
Henchard had determined.
---
He primed himself in
 the morning with a glass of rum, and
---
walking down the street met
 Elizabeth- Jane, whom he had not seen for a week.
---
"," he
 said to her,".
---
he was going to the Three Mariners
---
he elbowed his way through the gay throng to the shop of Woolfrey, the
 draper
---
In a few minutes he emerged,,
---
wearing, to her surprise, a brilliant
 rosette while more surprising still, in his hand he carried a flag of
 somewhat homely construction, formed by tacking one of the small
 Union Jacks, which abounded in the town to- day, to the end of a deal
 wand-- probably the roller from a piece of calico.
---
Henchard rolled up his
 flag on the doorstep,.


---
In the road under her eyes stood Henchard.
---
,, he was experiencing the momentary weakness of
 wishing for her notice
---
But he was far from attractive to a woman's eye,
.
---
He was not
 only a journeyman, unable to appear as he formerly had appeared, but
---
he
 disdained.
---
as he might
---
Henchard had doggedly retained the fretted and weather- beaten garments
 of bygone years.


---
: Lucetta's eyes slid over him to this side
 and to that without anchoring on his features--.
---
Her manner signified quite
 plainly that she meant to know him in public no more.


---
as he stood in animated
 converse with his friends a few yards off,
---
that her husband showed,
---
as he
 talked
---
which moved in little
 duplicates to his
---
At length a man stationed at the furthest turn of the high road, namely,
 on the second bridge of which mention has been made,
---
The carriages
 containing the Royal visitor and his suite arrived at the spot in a
 cloud of dust
---
a man stepped
 before any one could prevent him
---
It was Henchard.
---
He had unrolled
 his private flag, and
---
he staggered to the side of the
 slowing vehicle,.


---
while he blandly held out his right to the Illustrious Personage
---
Farfrae, with Mayoral authority, immediately rose to the occasion.
---
He
 seized Henchard by the shoulder,.
---
Henchard's eyes met his, and
---
Farfrae observed the fierce
 light in them despite his excitement and irritation.
---
For a moment
 Henchard stood his ground rigidly
---
Farfrae glanced to the ladies' gallery, and.


---
that
 his Calphurnia's cheek was pale
---
Why-- it is your husband's old patron!"
---
" Patron!" said Donald's wife with quick indignation.


---
the man is an acquaintance of Mr. Farfrae's
---
" He works for my husband
---
that it was through him

---
your husband first got a footing in Casterbridge.
---
Donald's genius would have

---
He would
 have been just the same if there had been no Henchard in the world!"


---
It was partly Lucetta's ignorance of the circumstances of Donald's
 arrival which led her to speak thus, partly the sensation that everybody
 seemed bent on snubbing her at this triumphant time.
---
He alighted
---
when he zung at the Dree Mariners
---
" Some difference
 between him now and," said the first
---
how he could get a lady of her quality en in such quick time
---
" I could worship ye, Buzz, for saying that," remarked Nance Mockridge.

---
" to keep up," said Longways.


---
Nance did not reply, but
---
Coney looked at him."
---
"," said Longways.
---
," said Longways emphatically.

---
that
 the Scotchman is a right enough man, and
---
that his lady has been a right
 enough' oman since she came here, and
---
Coney reflected.
---
Farfrae was still liked in the community; but
---
that,, he had lost in the eyes of the poorer inhabitants something
 of that wondrous charm which he had had for them as a light- hearted
 penniless young man, who sang ditties as readily as the birds in the
 trees
---
Hence the anxiety to keep him from annoyance.


---
Buzzford saying to
 Coney,"
---
Yes, to- night," Jopp had said
 to the Peter's party at the corner of Mixen Lane."
---
To him, at least, it was not a joke, but a retaliation.





---
that her husband
 might possibly receive the honour of knighthood, though idle to a
 degree
---
; stranger things had occurred to
 men so good and captivating as
---
After the collision with the Mayor, Henchard had withdrawn behind the
 ladies' stand; and
---
there he stood,.

---
where Farfrae's hand had seized it
---
He put his own hand there,.

---
as if he could hardly realize such an outrage
 from one whom it had once been
---
he distinctly heard
---
that he had assisted Donald
---
that he was anything more than a
 common journeyman
---
He moved on homeward, and."
---
," said Jopp.


---
He
 briefly related his attempt to win Lucetta's intercession.


---
Henchard merely heard his story, without taking it deeply in.
---
His own
 relation to Farfrae and Lucetta overshadowed all kindred ones.
---
He went
 on,"
---
he looked
---
He drove me back....
---
He can
 rub brine on a green wound!...
---
But he shall pay for it, and
---
how a
 coxcomb can front a man
---
being
 injured by him as a rival
---
snubbed by him as a journeyman
---
that he should be

---
shaken at the collar by him as a vagabond in the face of the whole town
---
Henchard went down Corn Street.
---
till he came to Farfrae's house, where he
 knocked, and
---
that he would be glad to see his employer at
 the granaries as soon as he conveniently could come there
---
Having done
 this he proceeded round to the back and.


---
as he had been aware
---
He had reached the granary steps
 and."


---
when he said to himself aloud,"
---
Henchard returned to a she d, where he selected a short piece of rope
 from several pieces that were lying about;
---
, he took the other in his right hand and;.
---
by this contrivance he
 pinioned the arm effectively
---
He now went up the ladders to the top
 floor of the corn- stores.


---
He fixed the door open and.
---
on which
 he had been standing with Farfrae
---
him lift
 his arm, with many misgivings as to what the movement portended
---
He retired a few steps into the loft and.
---
From this elevated
 perch his eyes could sweep the roofs round about, the upper parts of the
 luxurious chestnut trees, now delicate in leaves of a week's age, and
 the drooping boughs of the lines
---
In course of time-- he could not say.
---
Farfrae came through
---
He was dressed as if for a
 journey.
---
The low light of the nearing evening caught his head and
 face.
---
when he emerged from the shadow of the wall,
---
Henchard watched him with his mouth, the squareness of his jaw and the verticality of his profile being
 unduly marked.


---
Farfrae came on with one hand in his pocket, and.
---
that the words were most in his mind
---
They were those of the
 song he had sung when he arrived years before at the Three Mariners, a
 poor young man, adventuring for life and fortune, and scarcely knowing
 witherward:--

          "
---
Nothing moved Henchard like an old melody.
---
He sank back.
---
No;" he gasped.
---
At length Farfrae was silent, and
---
Henchard looked out of the loft door.
"
---
" he said.


---
Ay, man," said Farfrae.
---
A minute later Henchard heard his feet on the lowest ladder.
---
He heard
 him land on the first floor, ascend and land on the second,.
---
And then his head rose through the trap behind.


---
"?" he asked,.

---
" Why did n't ye take your holiday like the rest of the men?"
---
He spoke in
 a tone which had just severity enough in it to show that he remembered
 the untoward event of the forenoon, and his conviction that Henchard had
 been drinking.


---
Henchard said nothing; but
---
going back he closed the stair hatchway, and

---
stamped upon it; he next turned
 to the wondering young man, who by this time observed that one of
 Henchard's arms was bound to his side.

"
---
before you affronted
 to extremes a man who had nothing to lose
---
Farfrae warmed a little at this."
---
Ye'd no business there," he said.


---
, tell a man of
 my age he'd no business there!"
---
The anger- vein swelled in his forehead
.


---
as he spoke
---
" Royalty be damned," said Henchard.
---
"," said Henchard grimly.
---
If he likes
---
he may go down afterwards and
---
he may tell the
 truth--.
---
that's his business
---
As the strongest man I've tied one arm.
---
There was no time for Farfrae to do aught but one thing,, for the latter.
---
It was a wrestling match,
 the object of each being to give his antagonist a back fall; and
---
on
 Henchard's part, unquestionably, that it should be through the door.


---
At the outset Henchard's hold by his only free hand, the right, was on
 the left side of Farfrae's collar, which he firmly grappled, the latter
 holding Henchard by his collar with the contrary hand.
---
With his right he
 endeavoured
---
which, however, he
 could not do
---
to get hold of his antagonist's left arm,, so adroitly did Henchard keep it in the rear.


---
as he gazed
 upon the lowered eyes of his fair and slim antagonist
---
Henchard planted the first toe forward,.
---
Farfrae crossing him with his;
 and
---
Then Farfrae tried, and this part of the struggle ended by his forcing
 Farfrae down on his knees by sheer pressure of one of his muscular arms.

---
which was resisted by the larger man exerting all his force in
 a wrenching movement
---
as he was
---
Hampered, however, he could not keep him there, and.


---
Farfrae
 finding his feet again
---
By a whirl Henchard brought Donald dangerously near the precipice
---
as he might have been called from his appearance just
 now
---
he succeeded at last,.
---
Had Henchard's other arm been free

---
it would have been all over with Farfrae then.
---
But again he regained his
 feet,.
---
He instantly delivered
 the younger man an annihilating turn by the left fore- hip, and
---
following up his advantage thrust him towards the
 door,.


---
Farfrae's fair head was hanging over
 the window- sill, and
---
his arm dangling down outside the wall
---
Henchard between his gasps," this is the end of what you
 began this morning
---
" Then take it, take it!" said Farfrae.
---
Henchard looked down upon him in silence, and
---
"" he said bitterly.
---
that
 no man ever loved another
---
He withdrew to the back part of the loft,.

---
Farfrae regarded him in silence
---
Henchard would fain have recalled him, but
---
his tongue failed
 in its task, and
---
the young man's steps died on his ear.


---
Henchard took his full measure of shame and self- reproach.
---
The scenes of
 his first acquaintance with Farfrae rushed back upon him-- that time when
 the curious mixture of romance and thrift in the young man's composition
 so commanded his heart that Farfrae could play upon him as on an
 instrument.
---
was he
---
that he remained on the sacks
 in a crouching attitude, unusual for a man, and for such a man
---
He heard a conversation below, the opening of the coach- house
 door, and the putting in of a horse, but.


---
Here he stayed.
---
At length he arose,.

"
---
till he
 stood in the yard
---
He thought highly of me once
---
," he murmured.
---
" Now he'll hate!"


---
He became, and
---
possessed by an overpowering wish to see Farfrae again
 that night
---
as he
 walked towards Farfrae's door
---
But he recalled the unheeded doings in the
 yard.
---
while he had lain above in a sort of stupor
---
Farfrae he remembered

---
had gone to the stable and put the horse into the gig; while doing so
 Whittle had brought him a letter
---
; Farfrae had then said.


---
that he would
 not go towards Budmouth--
---
as he had intended
---
that he was
---
that place lying but one or two miles out of his course
---
He must have come prepared for a journey; and.


---
when he first arrived in the
 yard, unsuspecting enmity
---
he must have driven off( though in a
 changed direction) without saying a word to any one on what had occurred
 between themselves
---
It would therefore be useless to call at Farfrae's house till very late.


---
though waiting was
 almost torture to his restless and self- accusing soul
---
He walked about
 the streets and outskirts of the town,.
---
till he
 reached the stone bridge of which mention has been made, an accustomed
 halting- place with him now
---
Here he spent a long time,.


---
the purl of
 waters through the weirs meeting his ear, and
---
While leaning thus upon the parapet his listless attention was awakened
 by sounds of an unaccustomed kind from the town quarter.
---
His first incurious thought
, engaged in an attempt
 to round off a memorable day in a burst of evening harmony,
 was contradicted by certain peculiarities of reverberation.
---
But
 inexplicability did not rouse him to
---
more than a cursory heed; his sense
 of degradation was too strong for the admission of foreign ideas; and he
 leant against the parapet as before.





---
When Farfrae descended out of the loft breathless from his encounter
 with Henchard
---
, he paused at the bottom.
---
He arrived
 at the yard with the intention of putting the horse into the gig himself
(), and.
---
all the men having a holiday
---
Despite the fearful struggle he decided,.
---
He wished.


---
When he was just on the point of driving off
---
Whittle arrived with a note
 and.
---
On
 opening it he was surprised to see that it was unsigned.
---
It contained
 a brief request that he would go to Weatherbury that evening about some
 business which he was conducting there.
---
Farfrae knew nothing that could
 make it pressing; but
---
as he was bent upon going out he yielded to the
 anonymous request,.
---
particularly as he had a call to make at Mellstock
 which could be included in the same tour
---
Thereupon he told Whittle of
 his change of direction, in words which Henchard had overheard, and.
---
Farfrae had not directed his man and
---
Whittle had not been supposed.


---
Now the anonymous letter was a well- intentioned but clumsy contrivance
 of Longways and other of Farfrae's men to get him out of the way for
 the evening, in order that the satirical mummery should fall flat, if it
 were attempted.
---
when Farfrae was away
---
that the sound of his wheels might reach
 her ears early
---
which Henchard's show of
 effrontery had wrought in
---
the temporary uneasiness her disappeared with the quiet disappearance
 of Henchard himself under her husband's reproof.
---
The floating evidences
 of her absurd passion for him, and its consequences, had been destroyed,
 and
---
he's facing the tail."


---
The man has got on a blue coat and
---
kerseymere
 leggings; he has black whiskers, and a reddish face.'
---
" He will see it,
---
wo n't he?
---
Donald will
 see it!
---
He is just coming home-- and
---
it will break his heart
---
-- he will
 never love me any more-- and
---
the man
 sent off for a doctor
---
; he had been standing
 at his door, like others,.
---
as he
 saw the unhappy sufferer
---
As soon he said, in answer to Elizabeth's mute appeal,
"."


---
You
 must send at once for Mr. Farfrae.
---
Where is he?"


---
He has driven into the country, sir
---
He's likely to be back soon."


---
" Never mind, he must be sent for,.
---
in case he should not hurry
---
The man was, and
---
him clattering out of the yard at the back
---
Meanwhile Mr. Benjamin Grower, that prominent burgess of whom mention

---
as he sat indoors in the High Street,
---
,
 kits, crouds, humstrums, serpents, rams'-horns, and other historical
 kinds of music had put on his hat
 and.
---
He came to the corner above Farfrae's,
 and
---
for being a native of
 the town he had witnessed such rough jests before.
---
His first move was

---
whom he ultimately found in hiding up an alley yet
 more shrivelled than usual, having some not ungrounded fears
---
shrivelled men roughly handled
---
as Stubberd with Mr. Grower advanced into Corn
 Street
---
They passed Farfrae's, and.
---
"" Grower said
 magisterially to one of these in a fustian jacket, who smoked a short
 pipe and wore straps round his knees.


---
Mr. Grower repeated the words.


---
Charl shook his head to the zero of childlike ignorance.
---
And afore I."

 Joseph was quite as blank as the other in his reply.


---
" H'm," said Mr. Grower.
---
," he inquired,,
---
" O no-- nothing, sir," Jopp replied,.
---
Jopp suggested,).


---
as he rearranged his hand in his
 greatcoat pocket( where it ingeniously supported a pair of kitchen tongs
 and a cow's horn
---
" Now," said Mr. Grower,".
---
Grower spoke to' ee?"


---
The man,, shook his head absently.
---
?" he said to the woman who meditatively
 sipped her ale near him.


---
The other constable was facing the clock- case, where he saw reflected in
 the glass a quick motion by the landlady.
---
Turning sharply, he caught.


---
he observed.


---
what he knew
---
Long before this time Henchard, weary of his ruminations on the bridge,
 had repaired towards the town.
---
When he stood at the bottom of the street
 a procession burst upon his view, in the act of turning out of an alley
 just above him.
---
The lanterns, horns, and multitude startled him
---
; he saw
 the mounted images, and.


---
He turned
 back a few steps and.
---
Unable to rest there he
 went to his step- daughter's lodging, and.
---
that Elizabeth- Jane
 had gone to Mr. Farfrae's
---
Like one acting in obedience to a charm, and
 with a nameless apprehension, he followed in the same direction in the
 hope of meeting her
---
Disappointed in
 this he gave the gentlest of pulls to the door- bell, and.


---
that Farfrae should be brought home, and
---
" But he has gone to Mellstock and Weatherbury!"
---
exclaimed Henchard, now
 unspeakably grieved.
---
; he had lost his good name.
---
They would
 not believe him, but as the frothy utterances of
 recklessness.
---
lest he should
 never know the unexaggerated truth of her past relations with Henchard
---
Henchard, in a state of
 bitter anxiety and contrition, determined.


---
To this end he hastened down the town,.
---
till he had reached a second and almost
 a third hill about three miles distant
---
In Yalbury Bottom, or Plain,
 at the foot of the hill, he listened.
---
He knew.
---
it was Farfrae's gig
---
the vehicle having been his own till bought
 by the Scotchman at the sale of his effects
---
Henchard thereupon retraced
 his steps along Yalbury Plain, the gig.


---
as he had

---
By diverging to that village, intended to do, Farfrae might probably delay his return by a couple of
 hours.
---
that his intention was
---
Farfrae's off
 gig- lamp flashed in Henchard's face.
---
At the same time Farfrae discerned
 his late antagonist.

"
---
Farfrae-- Mr. Farfrae!" cried the breathless Henchard,.


---
Farfrae allowed.
---
before he pulled up
---
He then drew rein, and?" over his
 shoulder, as one.


---
Henchard said.
---
Farfrae was silent, and
---
at his silence Henchard's soul sank within him.

---
who, four hours earlier, had enticed Farfrae into a deadly wrestle
---
He
 stood
 now in the darkness of late night- time on a lonely road,.
---
where there might be a better
 opportunity of guarding himself from attack
---
Henchard could almost feel
 this view of things in course of passage through Farfrae's mind.


---
" to go to Mellstock," said Farfrae coldly,.


---
as he loosened his
 reins
---
The very agitation and abruptness of Henchard increased Farfrae's
 suspicion that this was a ruse to decoy him on to the next wood, where
 might be effectually compassed what, from policy or want of nerve
---
,
 Henchard had failed.
---
He started the horse.


---
deprecated Henchard running after
---
as he perceived the image of unscrupulous villainy
 that he assumed in his former friend's eyes
---
he cried hoarsely.
---
Your man has gone the other way in a mistake.
---
I am a wretched man
---
Farfrae, however, did distrust him utterly.
---
He knew, but.
---
he had left her not long ago in perfect health; and

---
Henchard's treachery was more credible than his story
---
He had in his
 time and
---
He quickened the horse's pace, and.


---
him lending yet more substance to his thought of evil purposes
---
The gig and its driver lessened against the sky in Henchard's eyes
---
;
 his exertions for Farfrae's good had been in vain.
---
He cursed himself
 like a less scrupulous Job, as a vehement man, the last mental prop under poverty.
---
when he loses
 self- respect
---
To this he had come
.
---
Presently he began.
---
by which he had arrived
---
Farfrae should at all events have
 no reason for delay upon the road by seeing him there when he took his
 journey homeward later on.


---
Arriving at Casterbridge Henchard went again to Farfrae's house.
---
As soon anxious faces confronted his
 from the staircase, hall, and landing; and
---
O-- it is not he
---
The manservant, finding his mistake,
 had long since returned, and
---
all hopes had centred upon Henchard.


---
But haven't you found him?"
---
Henchard replied."
---
as he sank down on a chair
 within the entrance
---
He ca n't be home for two hours.
---
Henchard regarded the sympathetic speaker for a few instants
---
So much for man's rivalry,
 he thought.
---
He had liked the look on her face.
---
what he desired
---
for the first time, he had a faint
 dream that he might get to like her as his own,--if she would only
 continue to love him.


---
Jopp was just going to bed.
---
when Henchard got home
---
Jopp said,"."


---
This is rather bad about Mrs. Farfrae's illness
---
Henchard shortly, though little dreaming of Jopp's
 complicity in the night's harlequinade, and raising his eyes just
 sufficiently to observe
---
that Jopp's face was lined with anxiety
---
when Henchard was

---
" Oh?--who could he be?"


---
" He seemed a well- be- doing man-- but

---
he gave no name, and no message."


---
" Nor do I gi'e him any attention."
---
And, saying this, Henchard closed his
 door.



---
The divergence to Mellstock delayed Farfrae's return very nearly the
 two hours of Henchard's estimate.
---
when at length Farfrae did come back.


---
he was in
 a state
---
much soothed by Donald's arrival
---
; he seldom or never left her side; and

---
to lisp out to him the
 secret, he checked her feeble words,.


---
he knew nothing of the skimmington- ride
---
The dangerous
 illness and miscarriage of Mrs. Farfrae was soon rumoured through the
 town, and.


---
What, and how much, Farfrae's wife ultimately explained to him of her
 past entanglement with Henchard,
---
he gave it up.

---
He called as much on Farfrae's account as on Lucetta's, and on
 Elizabeth- Jane's even more than on either's.
---
Shorn one by one of all
 other interests, his life seemed.
---
recently he could not endure
---
The last of his calls was made about four o'clock in the morning, in the
 steely light of dawn.
---
When within a few yards of Farfrae's he
 saw the door.
---
He went across,.

"
---
the
 sparrows in his way scarcely flying up from the road- litter,
---
said Henchard.


---
Henchard went home.
---
he lit his fire,
 and
---
He had not sat there long.
---
Henchard's face brightened,.
---
for he knew
---
"," said Henchard.
---
as he bade her, and

---
which Henchard had rigged up out of a
 settle in the adjoining room
---
him moving about in his
 preparations
---
finding he would not call her
---
; he
 waited on,.
---
In
 truth, a great change had come over him with regard to her, and
---
he was
.


---
He was disturbed by another knock at the door, and.
---
A stoutly built man
 stood on the doorstep, with an alien, unfamiliar air about his figure
 and bearing-- an air which might have been called colonial by people of
 cosmopolitan experience.
---
It was the man who had asked the way at Peter's
 finger.
---
Henchard nodded, and.


---
" Is it Mr. Henchard
---
" My name is Henchard."


---
By all means," Henchard answered,.


---
" said his visitor,.


---
Henchard observed him indifferently, and.


---
My name is Newson."


---
Henchard's face and eyes seemed.
---
"," Henchard said at last,.


---
He lives down by the
 mill,'.
---
that
 I'm the man you met then
---
a man's senses are
 himself."


---
"," said Newson.
---
," said Henchard, still
 with averted eyes.
---
Then a man advised
 me, and
---
Dead likewise," said Henchard doggedly.
---
" he said, in a low voice.
---
Henchard, without answering, shook his head.


---
as if that were rather a
 question for Newson himself than for him
---
" Beside her mother," said Henchard, in the same stolid tones.


---
Henchard never looked up from the floor.

---
Henchard heard the retreating footsteps of Newson upon the sanded floor,
 the mechanical lifting of the latch, the slow opening and closing of the
 door that was natural to a baulked or dejected man; but
---
he did not turn
 his head.
---
Newson's shadow passed the window.
---
He was gone.


---
Then Henchard, scarcely believing the evidence of his senses
---
what he had done
---
he had lately acquired for Elizabeth, the new- sprung
 hope of his loneliness that she would be to him a daughter of whom he
 could feel as proud as of the actual daughter
---
The regard to be, had been stimulated by the unexpected coming of Newson to a
 greedy exclusiveness in relation to her
---
him to speak mad lies like a child, in pure mockery
 of consequences
---
He had expected
---
questions to close in round him, and
 unmask his fabrication in five minutes;
---
; Newson's departure could be but
 momentary
---
; he would learn all by inquiries in the town; and!


---
He hastily put on his hat, and.
---
that Newson had
 taken
---
Newson's back was soon visible up the road,.

---
Henchard followed, and.
---
his visitor stop at the King's Arms, where
 the morning coach which had brought him waited half- an- hour for another
 coach which crossed there
---
Newson mounted,
---
his luggage was put in, and
---
in a few minutes
 the vehicle disappeared with him.


---
He had.
---
It was an act of simple faith
 in Henchard's words
---
who had taken Susan Henchard on the spur of the moment and on the
 faith of a glance at her face, more than twenty years before
---
who had taken
 Henchard's words on trust so absolute as to shame him
---
as he stood
---
Perhaps not for long," said he.
---
Newson might converse with his
 fellow- travellers
---
This probability threw Henchard into a defensive attitude, and
---
instead
 of considering how best to right the wrong, and acquaint Elizabeth's
 father with the truth at once, he bethought himself of ways to keep the
 position he had accidentally won.
---
He watched the distant highway expecting to see Newson return on foot,

---
Possibly he had spoken to nobody on the coach, but.


---
His grief!--what was it, after all, to that?
---
which he, Henchard, would
 feel at the loss of her
---
And thus his jealous
 soul speciously argued.


---
He returned to the house half.

---
I did not dream about poor Mrs.
 Farfrae, after thinking of her so
---
"," he said,.


---
Father," she said, as soon as she recalled herself to the outspread
 meal
---
"," he replied.
---
Henchard signified dubiousness.
---
Though he had
---
that
 Elizabeth- Jane might again live in his house as daughter
---
so lately hoped, he would
 not ask her.
---
Newson might return at any moment, and
---
his stepdaughter still lingered, till the
 moment.

---
at which Henchard was accustomed
---
Yet
 before the evening probably he will have come, and
---
This reflection, constantly repeated by Henchard to himself,.
---
His mood was no longer that of the
 rebellious, ironical, reckless misadventurer; but the leaden gloom of
 one who has lost all that can make life interesting, or even tolerable.

---
for him to be proud of
---
, nobody to fortify him
---
Susan,
 Farfrae, Lucetta, Elizabeth-- all had gone from him, one after one,
 either by his fault or by his misfortune.


---
In place of them he had no interest, hobby, or desire.
---
If he could have
 summoned music to his aid
---
his existence might even now have been borne
---
The merest trumpet or organ
 tone was enough to move him, and
---
high harmonies transubstantiated him.

---
that he should be unable to call up this
 Divine spirit in his need
---
The whole land ahead of him was as darkness itself
---
Yet in the natural course of life he might
 possibly have--
---
Henchard, however, leaving the town by the east road, proceeded to the
 second, or.
---
In a second or two he stood beside the
 weir- hole where the water was at its deepest.
---
He looked backwards and
 forwards, and
---
He then took off his coat
 and hat, and.


---
While his eyes were bent on the water beneath
---
he was intending
---
till it passed under his eyes
---
then he perceived
 with a sense of horror that it was HIMSELF.
---
one in all respects his counterpart, his actual
 double, was floating as if dead in Ten Hatches Hole.


---
The sense of the supernatural was strong in this unhappy man, and

---
he turned away.
---
He covered his eyes and.
---
he took his coat and hat, and
---
Presently he found himself by the door of his own dwelling.
---
To his
 surprise Elizabeth- Jane was standing there.
---
Newson, then, had not even yet
 returned.


---
He said to her,"?
---
I
 am not a read man.
---
he took her over the highway, and by the
 lonely path to Ten Hatches.
---
He walked restlessly, as if some haunting
 shade, unseen of her, hovered round him and troubled his glance.
---
When
 they got near the weir he stood still, and.


---
" Go again," said Henchard," and.
---
he could see her stoop till
---
Well," said Henchard;?"


---
"" he cried bitterly."
---
Then Henchard shaved for the first time during
 many days, and.


---
him say,"
---
that he was in Somebody's hand
---
The apparition of Newson haunted
 him.
---
He would surely return.


---
Yet Newson did not arrive.
---
Perhaps, after all, Newson was gone for ever.


---
In due time the bereaved Farfrae had learnt the, at least, proximate
 cause of Lucetta's illness and death, and
---
his first impulse was
 naturally enough to wreak vengeance in the name of the law upon the
 perpetrators of the mischief.
---
He resolved
---
the funeral was
 over ere he moved in the matter.
---
he reflected
---
The tempting prospect of putting to the blush people-- that supreme and piquant enjoyment of those-- had alone animated them, so far as he could
 see
---
; for he knew nothing of Jopp's incitements.
---
as an untoward accident seemed, to Farfrae, truest
 consideration for the dead one's memory, as well as best philosophy
---
For Elizabeth's sake the
 former had fettered his pride sufficiently.
---
headed by Farfrae
---
Had he been only personally
 concerned Henchard, without doubt
---
even
 remotely brought about by the man whom he had
---
But
 the sympathy of the girl seemed necessary to his very existence; and
---
Yet that Newson
 would ever now return to Casterbridge
---
He was a wanderer and a stranger, almost
 an alien
---
; he had not seen his daughter for several years
---
; his affection
 for her could not in the nature of things be keen; other interests would
 probably soon obscure his recollections of her, and prevent any such
 renewal of inquiry into the past as would lead to a discovery that she
 was still a creature of the present.
---
To satisfy his conscience somewhat
 Henchard repeated to himself.
---
which had retained for him

---
that the lie, but
 had come from him as the last defiant word of a despair which took no
 thought of consequences
---
Furthermore he pleaded within himself.


---
that no
 Newson could love her
---
as he loved her, or
---
as he was prepared to do cheerfully
---
Going out
 but seldom, and never on a marketday, they saw Donald Farfrae only at
 rarest intervals, and then mostly as a transitory object in the distance
 of the street.
---
Yet he was pursuing his ordinary avocations, as
 bereaved men do after a while.


---
Time," in his own grey style," taught Farfrae--.
---
There
 are men whose hearts insist upon a dogged fidelity to some image or
 cause thrown by chance into their keeping,
---
But Farfrae was not of those.
---
that the insight, briskness, and rapidity of his nature
 should take him out of the dead blank
---
which his loss threw about him
---
He
 could not but perceive.
---
that by the death of Lucetta he had exchanged
 a looming misery for a simple sorrow
---
But as a memory, nothwithstanding such conditions, Lucetta's image still
 lived on with him, her weaknesses provoking only the gentlest criticism,
 and her sufferings attenuating wrath at her concealments to a momentary
 spark now and then.


---
By the end of a year Henchard's little retail seed and grain shop, not
 much larger than a cupboard, had developed its trade considerably, and

---
Sometimes it occurred to him.


---
he was
---
one more bitter regret
 being added to those he had already experienced at having, by his severe
 censorship,
---
"," he said to her one day quite
 humbly.


---
He looked at it again.
---
though he was no judge of such articles
---
, he thought
.

"
---
?" he hazarded.


---
Some little time after,,
 he paused opposite her empty bedroom in passing it.
---
He thought of the
 time, and.
---
he had

---
what struck him about it
---
though he encouraged her
---
to buy
 in reason, he had no notion that she indulged her innate passion so
 extensively in proportion to the narrowness of their income.
---
For the
 first time he felt a little hurt by what he thought her extravagance,
 and.
---
before he had found

---
which set his thoughts flying in
 quite another direction
---
Henchard, contrary to his wo nt,
 went out one Saturday afternoon towards the market- place from a curious
 feeling that he would like to pass a few minutes on the spot of his
 former triumphs.
---
Farfrae, to whom he was still a comparative stranger,

---
he appeared.


---
about something he was

---
Henchard's eyes followed Farfrae's, and
---
he saw, but his own stepdaughter, who had
 just come out of a shop over the way.
---
that the object of his
 gaze was no sample- showing farmer
---
Henchard went away,.
---
that perhaps there was nothing significant
 after all in Farfrae's look at Elizabeth- Jane at that juncture
---
Yet he
 could not forget.
---
which had ruled his courses from the
 beginning and
---
Henchard's had mainly made him what he was.
---
that
 a union between his cherished step- daughter and the energetic thriving
 Donald was a thing to be desired for her
---
Instead of thinking good and his own, he hated the
 very possibility.


---
But he was not now the Henchard of former days.
---
He schooled
 himself.
---
He dreaded,.


---
lest an antagonistic word should lose for him
 such regard as he had regained from her by his devotion
---
But the mere thought of such separation fevered his spirit much, and
---
in
 the evening he said, with the stillness of suspense:"?"


---
Have you seen Mr.
 Farfrae to- day, Elizabeth
---
that I saw him in the
 street
---
He was wondering--.
---
if her embarrassment
 justified him in a new suspicion
---
, he diverted the discourse into another channel.


---
Henchard was, by original make, the last man to act stealthily, for good
 or for evil.
---
into which he had declined( or, in another sense,

---
to which he had advanced)--denaturalized him
---
He would often weigh
 and.
---
when a blunt settling question would formerly have been
 his first instinct
---
which should entirely displace her mild filial sympathy with
 himself
---
And now, uneasy at the thought of a passion for
 Farfrae, he observed.


---
, her return from those walks was often coincident with Farfrae's
 emergence from Corn Street for a twenty minutes' blow on that rather
 windy highway--.
---
as he said
---
Henchard became aware of this by going
 to the Ring, and,,.
---
till he saw
---
His face assumed an expression of extreme
 anguish.

"
---
Of her, too, he means!
---
to rob me" he whispered.
---
" But he has the right.

---
matters were by
 no means so far advanced between the young people as Henchard's jealous
 grief inferred.
---
Could he have heard such conversation
---
he would
 have been enlightened thus much:--

 HE.--"You like walking this way, Miss Henchard-- and
---
"

 HE( with the pathos of one of his native ballads).--"Ah, I doubt!
---
Henchard vowed
---
that he would leave them to their own devices,
---
If he
 were doomed
---
In the situation he could see no locus standi for himself
 at all.
---
Farfrae would never recognize him more than superciliously
---
; his
 poverty ensured that, no less than his past conduct.
---
the end of his life would be
 friendless solitude.


---
With he could not help watchfulness.

---
Indeed, within certain lines, he had the right to keep an eye upon her
 as his charge.
---
He was standing behind a wall close
 to the place at which Farfrae encountered her.
---
He heard," and
---
the young man
 address her as" Dearest Elizabeth- Jane
---
Henchard came out from the wall, and
.
---
Both Farfrae and Elizabeth- Jane,
 unlike the rest of the people, must suppose;
 and.
---
while he himself had the same belief
---
though Farfrae must have
---
who was his only friend,
---
rivalled, cursed, wrestled with for life in days before his spirit was
 broken, Henchard would have said,"."
---
One of these thoughts
 sailed into Henchard's ken now.


---
he were the fact that his betrothed
 was not the child of Michael Henchard at all-- legally, nobody's child;
 how would that correct and leading townsman receive the information?

---
He might possibly forsake Elizabeth- Jane, and
---
Henchard shuddered, and!
---
What Henchard saw
---
That Mr. Farfrae" walked with that bankrupt
 Henchard's step- daughter, of all women
---
Farfrae attended,
---
Perhaps the only inhabitants of the town were the members of the
 philosophic party, which included Longways, Christopher Coney, Billy
 Wills, Mr. Buzzford, and the like.
---
The Three Mariners having been, years
 before, the house in which they had witnessed the young man and woman's
 first and humble appearance on the Casterbridge stage
---
that it was a wonder
 such a man as Mr. Farfrae," a pillow of the town,
---
who might have chosen
 one of the daughters of the professional men or private residents
---
",
 should stoop so low, Coney ventured.


---
that's a stooping to he
---
When a man
 have put up a tomb of best marble- stone to the other one,, and
---
weeped his fill, and thought it all over, and said to hisself,
' T'other took me in
---
now';--well, he
 may do worse."


---
It
 would be a truer representation to say that Casterbridge( ever excepting
 the nineteen young ladies) looked up for a moment at the news, and
 withdrawing its attention, went on labouring and victualling, bringing
 up its children, and burying its dead, without caring a tittle for
 Farfrae's domestic plans.


---
Not a hint of the matter was thrown out to her stepfather by Elizabeth
 herself or by Farfrae either.
---
Reasoning on the cause of their reticence
 he concluded
---
that, estimating him by his past, the throbbing pair were
 afraid to broach the subject, and
---
as he
 was against society
---
Embittered, this moody view of himself took deeper and deeper
 hold of Henchard, till the daily necessity of facing mankind, and
---
of
 them particularly Elizabeth- Jane, became well- nigh more than he could
 endure.
---
His health declined
---
; he became morbidly sensitive.
---
He wished.


---
he
 could escape those who did not want him, and hide his head for ever
---
But what if he were mistaken in his views, and
---
there were no necessity
 that his own absolute separation from her should be involved in the
 incident of her marriage?


---
He proceeded.
---
in which his stepdaughter
 was mistress, an inoffensive old man
---
good- naturedly tolerated by her husband
---
It was terrible to his
 pride; and yet,.
---
for the girl's sake
 he might put up with anything; even from Farfrae; even snubbings and
 masterful tongue- scourgings
---
, the courtship---- had an absorbing interest for him.


---
Farfrae as often made it convenient to create an accidental meeting
 with her there.
---
Hitherward Henchard often
 resorted, glass in hand, and.


---
his object being
---
One day Henchard was at this spot.
---
Applying his telescope to his eye
 Henchard expected.

---
that Farfrae's features would be disclosed as usual
---
that today the man was not Elizabeth- Jane's
 lover
---
as he turned in the
 scrutiny of the road
---
he revealed his face.
---
Henchard lived a lifetime the
 moment
---
he saw it.
---
The face was Newson's.


---
Henchard dropped the glass, and.

---
Newson waited, and
---
Henchard waited--.
---
in any case Newson, if
 bent on a private meeting and a revelation of the truth to her, would
 soon make his opportunity.


---
Then he would tell her not only of his paternity, but of the ruse by
 which he had been once sent away.
---
Newson would reign in her heart
 in his stead.


---
But Newson did not see anything of her that morning.
---
Having stood still
 awhile he at last retraced his steps, and
---
Henchard felt like a condemned
 man who has a few hours' respite.
---
When he reached his own house
---
he found
 her there.


---
" O father!" she said innocently.
---
He says
.
---
he came, but
---
a trick was played him,
---
so that he
 did not see me
---
Donald is at the bottom of the mystery, and
---
that it is a relation of
 his who wants to pass an opinion on his choice
---
Henchard replied heavily," Yes."


---
his remaining in Casterbridge
---
The question of was for ever disposed of
 by this closing in of Newson on the scene.
---
Henchard was not the man to
 stand the certainty of condemnation on a matter so near his heart.
---
And
 being an old hand at bearing anguish in silence, and haughty withal,
 he resolved,.


---
as he could
---
He surprised the young woman whom he had looked upon as his all in this
 world by saying to her, as if he did not care about her more:" I am
 going to leave Casterbridge, Elizabeth- Jane."


---
that this
 resolve of his had come on account of her attachment and its probable
 result
---
that I might marry Mr. Farfrae
 some little time hence, and
---
Nothing would induce him
---
he was not
---
what he had

---
It was
 his conviction that she would not so refrain; and.


---
he exclaimed; adding
 more softly," but
---
It is because of Donald
---
to marry him," said Henchard.
---
" Promise not to quite
 forget me when----" He meant.


---
when Newson should come
---
the same evening at
 dusk Henchard left the town,.
---
to whose development he had been one of
 the chief stimulants for many years
---
During the day he had bought a new
 tool- basket.


---
that since his decline
 had characterized him in the Casterbridge street as a man who had seen
 better days
---
He went secretly and alone, not a soul of the many who had known him
 being aware of his departure.
---
Elizabeth- Jane accompanied him as far as
 the second bridge on the highway-- for the hour of her appointment with
 the unguessed visitor at
---
him go
---
his form diminish across the
 moor
---
, the yellow rush- basket at his back moving up and down with each
 tread, and.
---
the creases behind his knees coming and
---
Henchard
 formed at this moment
---
as he had presented
---
that the serious addition to his years
 had considerably lessened the spring to his stride,
---
that his state
 of hopelessness had weakened him, and
---
He went on.
---
till he came to the first milestone, which stood in the bank,
 half way up a steep hill
---
He rested his basket on the top of the stone,
.


---
"--!" he said.
---
I-- Cain-- go alone
-- an outcast and a vagabond.
---
He sternly subdued his anguish,.


---
Farfrae anxiously asked," and."

"
---
he gone
---
He is gone; and
---
I told him all I knew of your friend.
---
who is
 he?
---
And Mr. Henchard
 will hear of it."


---
if he does not go far
---
He will go far
---
"-- he's bent upon getting out of sight and sound!"


---
At Farfrae's house they stopped and.


---
Farfrae flung open the door of the ground- floor sitting- room,.
---
There he is waiting for you," and
---
who had called on Henchard on a memorable
 morning between one and two years before this time, and
---
the broad- faced genial man mount the coach and
---
It was Richard Newson.
---
The meeting with the light- hearted father from
 whom she had been separated half- a- dozen years,.
---
Henchard's departure was in a moment.
---
to be handled the difficulty of restoring her to her
 old belief in Newson was not so great as might have seemed likely,
 for Henchard's conduct itself was a proof that those facts were true.

---
Henchard been her father in nature, this father in early domiciliation

---
when the incidents of
 her parting with Henchard had a little worn off
---
Newson's pride in to be was more than he could
 express.
---
He kissed her again and again.


---
" to come and meet me-- ha- ha" said Newson.

---
" that Mr. Farfrae here, he said,'.''
---
Well, Henchard is gone
---
"," said Farfrae,."
---
He has done
 it all voluntarily, and,
---
, he has been very
 nice with her.
---
"," said Newson, looking into the face
 of each by turns.
---
"," said Farfrae.
---
With all my heart," said Captain Newson;"
---
now poor Henchard's gone; though I would n't have done it
 otherwise, or; for I've already in my
 lifetime been an intruder into his family quite as far as politeness
 can be expected to put up with.
---
Donald and," murmured Elizabeth,.


---
I've provided for men and
 shipmates times enough, but
---
said Farfrae,.
---
Newson, leaning
 back in his chair and smiling reflectively at the ceiling, said," or
---
, Mr. Farfrae, how Henchard put me off the scent
 that time?"


---
He expressed ignorance of what the Captain alluded to.


---
But now he's gone
---
-- that a man of the name of
 Henchard had been mayor here
---
that the man was selling me a packet,
---
Then he kept you from me, father, all those months,?"


---
The father admitted.

"
---
He ought!
---
not to have done it" said Farfrae.


---
I would never forget him
---
Newson, like a good many rovers and sojourners among strange men and
 strange moralities, failed,
 notwithstanding.

---
that he himself had been the chief sufferer therefrom
---
Indeed,, he began.

"
---
that he said
---
Well,' twas not ten words, after all," Newson pleaded.

---
" And how could he know?'
---
that I should be such a simpleton as to believe
 him
---
He knew
 your disposition--
---
he did it to wrong you.
---
he was my father
---
After
 weaning me from you these five years by saying, he
 should not have done this."


---
Even had he been present

---
Henchard might scarce have pleaded it,.


---
so little did he value himself or
 his good name
---
Meanwhile, the man of their talk had pursued his solitary way eastward
, and
---
till weariness overtook him
---
he looked about for a place of rest.

---
His heart was so exacerbated at parting from the girl that he could not
 face an inn, or even a household of the most humble kind; and
---
he lay down under a wheatrick,.
---
The very
 heaviness of his soul caused.


---
him to sleep profoundly
---
The bright autumn sun shining into his eyes across the stubble awoke him
 the next morning early.
---
He opened his basket and.
---
what he had packed for his supper
---
he brought
---
Although everything necessitated
 carriage at his own back, he had secreted among his tools a few of
 Elizabeth- Jane's cast- off belongings, in the shape of gloves, shoes, a
 scrap of her handwriting, and the like, and in his pocket he carried a
 curl of her hair.
---
Having looked at these things he closed them up again,
 and.


---
During five consecutive days Henchard's rush basket rode along upon
 his shoulder between the highway hedges, the new yellow of the rushes
 catching the eye of an occasional field- labourer as he glanced through
 the quickset, together with the wayfarer's hat and head, and down- turned
 face, over which the twig shadows moved in endless procession.
---
that the direction of his journey was Weydon Priors,
 which he reached on the afternoon of the sixth day
---
when Henchard halted upon
 the summit
---
He deposited his basket upon the turf, and
---
looked about with
 sad curiosity; till he discovered the road by which his wife and himself
 had entered on the upland so memorable to both, five- and- twenty years
 before.


---
" Yes, we came up that way after ascertaining his bearings.

---
," he said,
---
He walked to
 another spot,
---
it seemed
 so to him.
---
He experienced not only the bitterness of a man who finds, in looking
 back upon an ambitious course, but
---
what he has sacrificed in sentiment

---
that was worth as much as what he has gained in substance;
---
the superadded
 bitterness of seeing his very recantation nullified.
---
He had been sorry
 for all this long ago; but
---
his attempts to replace ambition by love had
 been.
---
Part of his wish to wash his hands of
 life arose from his perception of its contrarious inconsistencies-- of
 Nature's jaunty readiness to support unorthodox social principles.


---
He intended.
---
But he could not help, and the quarter of the horizon in which she lived.
---
that the centrifugal tendency was counteracted by the centripetal influence of his love
 for his stepdaughter
---
As a consequence, instead of following a straight
 course yet further away from Casterbridge, Henchard gradually, almost
 unconsciously, deflected from that right line of his first intention.
---
;
 till, by degrees, his wandering, like that of the Canadian woodsman,
 became part of a circle of which
---
In
 ascending any particular hill he ascertained the bearings by means of the sun, moon, or stars, and settled in his mind
 the exact direction in which Casterbridge and Elizabeth- Jane lay.

---
as nearly as
 he could
---
Sneering at himself for his weakness he yet every hour-- nay, every few
 minutes-- conjectured her actions for the time being-- her sitting down
 and rising up, her goings and comings, till thought of Newson's and
 Farfrae's counter- influence would pass like a cold blast over a pool,
 and.
---
And then he would say to himself,"!
---
At length he obtained employment at his own occupation of hay- trusser,
 work of that sort being in demand at this autumn time.
---
The scene of his
 hiring was a pastoral farm near the old western highway
---
He had chosen the
 neighbourhood of this artery from a sense that, situated here, though at
 a distance of fifty miles, he was virtually nearer to her whose welfare
 was so dear than he would be at a roadless spot only half as remote.


---
And thus Henchard found himself again on the precise standing which he
 had occupied a quarter of a century before.
---
Externally there was nothing
 to hinder his making another start on the upward slope, and.
---
He had
 no wish to make an arena a second time of a world that had become a mere
 painted scene to him.


---
Very often, as his hay- knife crunched down among the sweet- smelling
 grassy stems
---
, he would survey mankind and
---
say to himself:" Here and
 everywhere be folk dying before their time like frosted leaves,, the country, and the world; while I, an
 outcast, an encumberer of the ground, wanted by nobody, and"


---
He often kept an eager ear upon the conversation of those who passed
 along the road-- not from a general curiosity by any means-- but in the
 hope that among these travellers between Casterbridge and London
 some would, sooner or later, speak of the former place.
---
The distance,
 however, was too great to lend much probability to his desire; and
---
the
 highest result of his attention to wayside words was.
---
that he did

---
Henchard ran to the gate of the field
---
he worked in, and
.


---
" Yes-- I've come from there, maister in answer to Henchard's
 inquiry.
---
," he said,
---
that Mr. Farfrae, the late mayor, is thinking of getting
 married
---
The man declared and
---
he remembered nothing about it;
---
Henchard was convinced.
---
He might, for that matter, write and; but
---
his
 instinct for sequestration had made the course difficult.
---
before he
 left her
---
The remembrance would continually revive in him now.
---
that it was not
 Elizabeth and Farfrae, but his own
 haughty sense that his presence was no longer desired
---
who had driven him away from them
---
He had assumed
 the return of Newson without absolute proof that the Captain meant to
 return
---
that Elizabeth- Jane would welcome him; and
---
if he did return
---
whatever that he would stay
---
he had

---
What if been mistaken in his views; if there had been no necessity that his
 own absolute separation from her he loved should be involved in these
 untoward incidents?
---
To make one more attempt to be near her: to go back,
 to see her, to plead his cause before her, to ask forgiveness for his
 fraud, to endeavour strenuously to hold his own in her love; it was
 worth the risk of repulse, ay, of life itself.


---
husband and wife to despise him for his inconsistency
---
But how to initiate this reversal of all his former resolves without
 causing was a
 question which made him tremble and brood.


---
He cut and.
---
then he concluded his
 hesitancies by a sudden reckless determination to go to the wedding
 festivity
---
Neither writing nor message would be expected of him.
---
his unanticipated presence would
 fill the little unsatisfied corner that would probably have place in her
 just heart without him.


---
To intrude as little of his personality as possible upon a gay event
, he decided
.


---
He started on foot, two mornings before St. Martin's- tide, allowing
 himself about sixteen miles to perform for each of the three days'
 journey, reckoning the wedding- day as one.
---
There were only two towns,
 Melchester and Shottsford, of any importance along his course, and at
 the latter he stopped on the second night, not only to rest, but.


---
he stood in-- now stained and
 distorted by their two months of hard usage
---
Possessing no clothes but the working suit, he entered a shop, externally at any rate, a little in
 harmony with the prevailing tone of the morrow.
---
which should put him
---
that in appearance at least he would not now
 offend her
---
having satisfied himself, he proceeded to the more interesting particular of buying
 her some present.


---
He walked up and down the street,, from a gloomy sense.

---
what
 he might most like
---
that to give her would be beyond his miserable pocket
---
At length a caged goldfinch met his eye.
---
on inquiry he concluded
---
he could afford

---
A sheet of newspaper was tied round the little
 creature's wire prison, and with the wrapped up cage in his hand
 Henchard sought a lodging for the night.


---
Next day he set out upon the last stage, and.
---
which had been his dealing ground in bygone years
---
he travelled by carrier,
---
He heard, however, but.
---
few particulars beyond those known to him
 already, the incident of the deepest interest on the journey being the
 soft pealing of the Casterbridge bells, which reached the travellers'
 ears while the van paused on the top of Yalbury Hill to have the drag
 lowered
---
;; that Elizabeth- Jane and Donald
 Farfrae were man and wife.


---
Henchard did not care.
---
Indeed, it quite unmanned him; and
---
, lest he should mortify
---
in
 pursuance of his plan of not showing himself in Casterbridge street till
 evening Farfrae and his bride, he alighted here,
 with his bundle and bird- cage, and.


---
It was the hill near which he had waited to meet Farfrae, almost two
 years earlier, to tell him of the serious illness of his wife Lucetta.

---
Farfrae had another wife-- and,.
---
as Henchard knew, a better one
---
He only
 hoped.


---
He passed the remainder of the afternoon in a curious highstrung
 condition, unable to do much but.
---
he would wait till their
 return.
---
To assure himself on this point he asked a market- man when near
 the borough.


---
Henchard dusted his boots,.
---
He need have made no
 inquiries beforehand, for on drawing near Farfrae's residence
---
that
 Donald himself shared it,
---
his voice being distinctly audible in the
 street,
---
that he loved
---
these Henchard passed quickly on to the door.


---
His courage failed him.
---
he loved,
---
if not to court repulse
 from her husband
---
Accordingly he went round into the street at the back
.


---
that he knew so well,, and,,
---
Solitude and sadness had so emolliated Henchard
---
that he now feared
 circumstances he would formerly have scorned, and
---
he began.
---
that
 he had not taken upon himself
---
However,
 his progress was made unexpectedly easy by his discovering alone in
 the kitchen an elderly woman who seemed to be acting as provisional
 housekeeper during the convulsions from which Farfrae's establishment
 was just then suffering.
---
though to her, a total stranger, his request must have

---
that he had
---
He thereupon
 followed her thither, and
---
till that was over before announcing
 him
---
that of the room Henchard sat in being ajar
---
, he could see
 fractional parts of the dancers streaming curls of hair; together with about three- fifths of the band in
 profile, including the restless shadow of a fiddler's elbow, and the tip
 of the bass- viol bow.


---
The gaiety jarred upon Henchard's spirits; and.
---
he could not quite
 understand, notwithstanding the fact that
 he was quite a young man still, and quickly kindled to enthusiasm by
 dance and song
---
who had had
 his trials
---
why Farfrae, a much- sobered man, and a widower,, should have cared for it all
---
surprised him still more.
---
, he concluded, and
---
then for the first time he caught a glimpse of the once despised
 daughter who had mastered him, and.
---
his heart ache
---
, he was not near enough to say which-- snowy
 white, without a tinge of milk or cream; and
---
Presently Farfrae
 came round,.
---
his exuberant Scotch movement making him conspicuous in a
 moment
---
Henchard could discern
.


---
By degrees Henchard became aware that the measure was trod by some one
 who out- Farfraed Farfrae in saltatory intenseness.
---
that Henchard saw him
---
The first time he was
.
---
, his head quivering and low down, his legs in the
 form of an X and his back towards the door
---
he came round
 in the other direction
---
The next time, his white waist- coat preceding his face, and.
---
his
 toes preceding his white waistcoat
---
That happy face-- Henchard's complete
 discomfiture lay in it.
---
Newson's, supplanted him
---
Henchard pushed to the door, and.
---
He rose to his feet, and."


---
obscured by
" the shade from his own soul
---
But he was no longer the man to stand these reverses unmoved.
---
His
 agitation was great, and
---
he would fain have been gone, but
---
before
 he could leave the dance
---
" he cried,.
---
that
 my father was not my father
---
when he, my warm- hearted real father, came

---
which nearly broke his heart
---
as I once did a man who
 has served us like this
---
Henchard's lips half parted.
---
But he shut them up
 like a vice, and.
---
How should he, there and then, set
 before her with any effect the palliatives of his great faults--
---
that he
 had himself been deceived in her identity at first,
---
that his own child had died
---
; that, in the second
 accusation, his lie had been the last desperate throw of a gamester
 who loved her affection better than his own honour?
---
that he did not
 sufficiently value himself
---
Waiving, therefore, his privilege of self- defence, he regarded only his
 discomposure.
---
," he said, with
 proud superiority.
---
Then,, Henchard went out from her
 rooms, and
---
departed from the house by the back way as he had come; and

---
the only difference between Donald's movements now and formerly was.


---
that
 he hastened indoors rather more quickly after business hours than he had
 been in the habit of doing for some time
---
Newson had stayed in Casterbridge three days after the wedding party
( whose gaiety, as might have been surmised, was of his making rather
 than of the married couple's), and
---
the inhabitants did not altogether lose their equanimity
 on his account
---
On the fourth morning he was discovered.
---
that he preferred Budmouth as a place of
 residence
---
Thither he went, and.


---
Donald Farfrae had

---
-- he was seen wi' it in his
 hand; and"


---
as he came up the street
---
that he put it down
 and
---
while he came in with his message,
---
where
 he had left it
---
brought by Henchard for her as a wedding gift and token of repentance
---
He had not expressed to her any regrets or excuses for what he had done
 in the past; but
---
it was a part of his nature to extenuate nothing, and
 live on as one of his own worst accusers.
---
from that hour her heart
 softened towards the self- alienated man
---
When her husband came in
---
whither Henchard had banished himself,
---
Although Farfrae had never so
 passionately liked Henchard
---
as Henchard had liked him
---
, he had, on the
 other hand,
---
as his
 former friend had done
---
he was therefore.


---
But it was by no means easy to set about discovering Henchard.
---
He had

---
what he had once attempted
---
Henchard had become a changed man since
 then-- as far, that is, as change of emotional basis can justify such
 a radical phrase; and
---
In a few days Farfrae's
 inquiries elicited.


---
that Henchard had been seen by one who knew him
 walking steadily along the Melchester highway eastward, at twelve
 o'clock at night-- in other words, retracing his steps on the road by
 which he had come
---
the next morning Farfrae might have been discovered
.
---
Elizabeth- Jane
 sitting beside him,
---
before
 he should sink into that lower stage of existence which was only too
 possible to him now
---
After driving along the highway for a few miles learnt of a road- mender,, that he had observed.
---
such a man at the time mentioned
---
; he had

---
Farfrae drove onward, and
---
Donald strongly advised
 his wife.
---
to get back to
 Casterbridge that same day, while to go much further afield would reduce
 them to the necessity of camping out for the night," and," said Farfrae.
---
He accordingly drew rein, but.
---
; his gait was shambling, his regard fixed in front of him as
 absolutely as if he wore blinkers; and in his hand he carried a few
 sticks.
---
he descended into a ravine, where a
 cottage revealed itself, which he entered
---
that must be
 poor Whittle
---
Tis just like him," observed Elizabeth- Jane.


---
" And it may be Whittle,,; and."


---
for he's never been to the yard these three
 weeks
---
I owing him for
 two days' work, without knowing who to pay it to
---
Farfrae hitched the reins to the gate- post, and
---
; Farfrae knocked; and
---
he was Whittle,.


---
His face showed marks of deep sadness.
---
, his eyes lighting on them with an
 unfocused gaze; and he still held in his hand the few sticks he had been
 out to gather
---
as he recognized them
---
As soon he started.


---
said Farfrae.


---
he was kind- like to mother though' a was rough to me."


---
He's just gone
---
Yes, ma'am, he's gone!
---
He was kind- like to mother.
---
he looked low and faltering
---
he turned and, and!'

---
he turned again, and?
---
that he was low
---
Then he walked on, and
---
he
 never complained at me no more.
---
that he wambled
---
him to come back
---
What, Whittle,' he said,' and!'
---
But he did n't gain strength,,
 ma'am
---
, he could n't eat-- no appetite at all-- and
---
he got weaker; and
.
---
to- day he died
---
a man to measure
 him
---
said Farfrae.


---
Upon the head of his bed he pinned a piece of paper, with some writing
 upon it
---
"," continued Abel Whittle.
---
" But not being a man o' letters, I
 ca n't read writing
---
while he ran into the cottage;
---
" That Elizabeth- Jane Farfrae be not told of my death, or.
"&.
"&.
"&.
"&.
"&.
"
---
that no man remember me
---
said Donald, when he had handed the paper to her.


---
What Henchard had written in the anguish of his dying
---
that the man meant
---
what he said
---
the directions
 to be a piece of the same stuff that his whole life was made of
---
even her regrets for having misunderstood him on
 his last visit, for
