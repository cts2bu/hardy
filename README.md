My MA dissertation at King's College London is a rhetorical and semantic study of Thomas Hardy's work using digital tools. My analysis focuses on how Hardy explores the concept of characterization along gendered lines.

<a href="http://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/english/research/docuscope.html">Carnegie Mellon's DocuScope suite</a> performs the rhetorical analysis, but it needs targeted sentences to generate information beyond text-wide sentiment analysis. As such, I have stood up this project in an attempt to parse Hardy's works and to pull out phrases directly associated with characterizing male and female figures.

This project utilizes the <a href="https://spacy.io/">spaCy</a> library to tokenize and to tag Hardy's texts into more illuminating chunks. The hopeful product will be a set of text files containing phrases, or subject-verb-object sets, associated with each each gender in each novel.
