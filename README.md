My MA dissertation at King's College London is a rhetorical and semantic study of Thomas Hardy's work using digital tools. My analysis focuses on how Hardy explores the concept of characterization along gendered lines.

<a href="http://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/english/research/docuscope.html">Carnegie Mellon's DocuScope suite</a> performs the rhetorical analysis, but DocuScope requires rather targeted data to function beyond text-wide sentiment analyses. As such, the study necessitates scripts, which will utilize the <a href="https://spacy.io/">spaCy</a> library to help with tokenizing and tagging Hardy's texts into more digestable and illuminating chunks. The hopeful product will be a set of text files containing adjectives and verbs associated with each character in each novel to facilitate my investigation into how Hardy develops his female and male characters.

The project is still in its early stages and may change quite significantly. Regular updates probably will not occur until late April/May.
