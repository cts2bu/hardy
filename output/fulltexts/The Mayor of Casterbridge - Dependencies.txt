child, were approaching the large village of Weydon-Priors, in Upper
Wessex, on foot.

They were plainly but not ill clad, though the thick
hoar of dust which had accumulated on their shoes and garments from
an obviously long journey lent a disadvantageous shabbiness to their

He wore a short jacket of brown corduroy, newer than the

His measured,
springless walk was the walk of the skilled countryman as distinct from
the desultory shamble of the general labourer; while in the turn and
plant of each foot there was, further, a dogged and cynical indifference
personal to himself, showing its presence even in the regularly
interchanging fustian folds, now in the left leg, now in the right, as
he paced along.

machinery, more audible than the note of the bell; a row of tall,

in one after another just as the shutters were enclosing them, like a
row of actors delivering their final speeches before the fall of the
curtain; then chimes were heard stammering out the Sicilian Mariners’
Hymn; so that chronologists of the advanced school were appreciably on

Nobody would have conceived from his outward

stimulant to the bustle going on in his gaunt, great house; nothing

another, to provide a comfortable home for Elizabeth-Jane under his
paternal eye; and a third, to castigate himself with the thorns which
these restitutory acts brought in their train; among them the lowering
of his dignity in public opinion by marrying so comparatively humble a

sparrow shook himself, the silence in Casterbridge--barring the rare
sound of the watchman--was broken in Elizabeth’s ear only by the

and all this while the subtle-souled girl asking herself why she was
born, why sitting in a room, and blinking at the candle; why things
around her had taken the shape they wore in preference to every other
possible shape.

approached, as if some strange fish interested him, though every finned
thing had been poached out of the river years before.

A white apron is a suspicious vesture in
situations where spotlessness is difficult; moreover, the industry and
cleanliness which the white apron expressed were belied by the postures
and gaits of the women who wore it--their knuckles being mostly on their
hips (an attitude which lent them the aspect of two-handled mugs), and
their shoulders against door-posts; while there was a curious alacrity
in the turn of each honest woman’s head upon her neck and in the twirl
of her honest eyes, at any noise resembling a masculine footfall along
the lane.

Although Farfrae had never so
passionately liked Henchard as Henchard had liked him, he had, on the
other hand, never so passionately hated in the same direction as his
former friend had done, and he was therefore not the least indisposed to
assist Elizabeth-Jane in her laudable plan.

walking steadily along the Melchester highway eastward, at twelve

which he had come.

This was enough; and the next morning Farfrae might have been discovered
driving his gig out of Casterbridge in that direction, Elizabeth-Jane
sitting beside him, wrapped in a thick flat fur--the victorine of the

matronly dignity, which the serene Minerva-eyes of one “whose gestures

After driving along the highway for a few miles they made further

That the road they were following had, up to this point, been Henchard’s

grateful in itself, and doubly so after the Capharnaum in which some of
her preceding years had been spent.

As the lively and sparkling emotions
of her early married life cohered into an equable serenity, the finer
movements of her nature found scope in discovering to the narrow-lived
ones around her the secret (as she had once learnt it) of making limited
opportunities endurable; which she deemed to consist in the cunning
enlargement, by a species of microscopic treatment, of those minute
forms of satisfaction that offer themselves to everybody not in positive
pain; which, thus handled, have much of the same inspiring effect upon
life as wider interests cursorily embraced.

And in being forced to class herself among the
