his present residence--

recommencing with a name that would not too readily identify him with
the smart tradesman of the past, and that would be less commonplace

He had been
disintegrated into a number of varied fellow-creatures--beings of
many minds, beings infinite in difference; some happy, many serene, a
few depressed, one here and there bright even to genius, some stupid,
others wanton, others austere; some mutely Miltonic, some potentially
Cromwellian--into men who had private views of each other, as he had
of his friends; who could applaud or condemn each other, amuse or
sadden themselves by the contemplation of each other's foibles or
vices; men every one of whom walked in his own individual way the
road to dusty death.

Mr Clare, as a gentleman and a student of history, would respect

she was no spurious d'Urberville, compounded of money and ambition
like those at Trantridge, but true d'Urberville to the bone.

carried her off to a distant settlement, English or colonial; and

assistance to her at what she might feel to be a trying ordeal--her
presentation to his mother at the Vicarage.

English uplands, had resisted all the weathers to whose moods they
had been born, could resist equally well all the weathers by which
they were surprised on Brazilian plains.

He had undergone some strange experiences in his absence; he had seen
the virtual Faustina in the literal Cornelia, a spiritual Lucretia in
a corporeal Phryne; he had thought of the woman taken and set in the

made a queen; and he had asked himself why he had not judged Tess
constructively rather than biographically, by the will rather than
by the deed?
