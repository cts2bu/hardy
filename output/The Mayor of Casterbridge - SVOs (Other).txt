One evening of late summer, before the nineteenth century had reached
 one- third of its span, a young man and woman, the latter carrying a
 child.
---
They were plainly but not ill,.


---
which had accumulated on their shoes and garments from
 an obviously long journey
---
though the thick
 hoar of dust lent a disadvantageous shabbiness to their
 appearance just now
---
What was really peculiar, however
---
, in this couple's progress, and would
 have attracted the attention of any casual observer otherwise disposed
 to overlook them, was the perfect silence they preserved.
---
They walked
 side by side in such a way as to suggest afar off the low, easy,
 confidential chat of people full of reciprocity; but
---
on closer view it
 could be discerned.
---
Whether this apparent
 cause were the real cause, or
---
, nobody but himself
 could have said precisely; but
---
If any word at all were uttered by the little group
---
The
 first phase was the work of Nature, the second probably of civilization.


---
the parents of
 the girl in arms there could be little doubt.
---
No other than such
 relationship would have accounted for the atmosphere of stale
 familiarity which the trio carried along with them like a nimbus as they
 moved down the road.


---
The grassy margin of the bank,
 and the nearest hedgerow boughs, were powdered by the dust that had been
 stirred over them by hasty vehicles, the same dust as it lay on the road
 deadening their footfalls like a carpet; and
---
this, with the aforesaid
 total absence of conversation, allowed.


---
every extraneous sound to be

---
For a long time there was none, beyond the voice of a weak bird singing
 a trite old evening song that might doubtless have been heard on the
 hill at the same hour, and with the self- same trills, quavers, and
 breves, at any sunset of that season for centuries untold.
---
as they
 approached the village sundry distant shouts and rattles
---
When the outlying houses of Weydon- Priors could just be
 described
---
The reader promptly
 glanced up.


---
The turnip- hoer had already begun.
---
that' a should come to Weydon for a job of that

---
" Then is there any house to let-- a little small new cottage?
---
The pessimist still maintained a negative.
---
" Pulling down is more the
 nater of Weydon.
---
There were five houses cleared away last year, and
 three this; and the volk nowhere to go-- no, not so much as a thatched
 hurdle
---
; that's the way
---
The hay- trusser,, nodded with some
 superciliousness.
---
There is
 something going on here, however
---
, is there not?"


---
what you hear now
---
Though is little more than the
 clatter and scurry of getting away the money
---
o' children and fools, for
 the real business is done earlier than this.
---
which showed standing- places and pens where many hundreds of
 horses and sheep had been exhibited and sold in the forenoon
---
as their informant had
 observed, but
---
little real business remained on hand,
---
the chief being the
 sale by auction of a few inferior animals,
---
had been absolutely refused by the better class
 of traders, who came and went early
---
Yet the crowd was denser now
 than during the morning hours
---
Neither of our pedestrians had much heart for these things, and
---
they
 looked around for a refreshment tent among the many which dotted the
 down.
---
which stood nearest to them in the ochreous haze of expiring
 sunlight
---
Two,, seemed.
---
One was formed of new,
 milk- hued canvas, and
---
bore red flags on its summit; it announced" Good
 Home- brewed Beer, Ale, and Cyder."
---
The other was less new
---
; a little iron
 stove- pipe came out of it at the back and."
---
so will you.
---
It is nourishing after a long hard
 day.
---
they entered the furmity booth forthwith.


---
A rather numerous company appeared within,.
---
that ran down the tent on each side
---
which hung a large three- legged
 crock, sufficiently polished round the rim
---
that it was made
 of bell- metal
---
Vessels
 holding the separate ingredients stood on a white- clothed table of
 boards and trestles close by.


---
This was very well so far,
 for furmity,.


---
though, to those not
 accustomed to it, the grains of wheat swollen as large as lemon- pips,

---
which floated on its surface
---
But there was more in that tent; and
---
The liquor poured in
---
was rum.

---
hers laced also
---
, the rum being
 signalled for in yet stronger proportion.
---
The child began, and
---
You know
---
we may have
 trouble in getting it if we do n't go soon."


---
when they were lighted
---
The child's black eyes, after slow, round, ruminating gazes
 at the candles, fell together
---
; then they opened,

---
The conversation took a high turn,.

---
as it often does on such occasions
---
"," said the trusser with a
 contemplative bitterness that was well- night resentful.
---
this is the consequence o't."
---
who seemed accustomed to such remarks
---
The auctioneer selling the old horses in the field outside could be

---
Now this is the last lot--
---
now who'll take the last
 lot for a song
---
knocked out by the kick of another
---
who have got wives and
---
as these gipsy fellows do their old horses
---
" Why should n't they put'em up and?
---
" There's them that would do that
---
," some of the guests replied,.


---
who was by no means ill- favoured
---
True," said a smoking gentleman, whose coat had the fine polish about
 the collar, elbows, seams, and shoulder- blades that long- continued
 friction with grimy surfaces will produce, and which is usually more
 desired on furniture than on clothes.
---
nobody do
---
though it may want a little bringing out
---
Michael, you have talked this
 nonsense in public places before
---
A joke is a joke, but
---
I know true cultivation, or; and I
 can declare-- in the bone,, I say--; I am open to an offer for this gem o'
 creation. you may make it
 once too often, mind!"


---
" I know I've said it before; I meant it. All I want is a buyer."


---
which had by
 chance
---
At the moment a swallow, one among the last of the season, found its way through an opening into the upper part of the tent,
.
---
till it made its escape
---
In watching the bird the
 assembled company neglected, and
---
the
 subject dropped.


---
The company had by this time
---
the renewed
 inquiry was received with a laugh of appreciation.
---
If you do n't come along
---
If you do n't come along, I shall go without you.
" I
 asked this question, and nobody answered to' t.
---
Straw among ye buy my goods?"


---
colour of which mention has been made
---
" Mike, Mike" this is getting serious.
---
somebody would
---
So we are agreed about that.
---
Gentlemen, you
 hear?
---
It's an agreement to part.
---
Now, who's auctioneer?
---
" Who'll make an offer
 for this lady?"


---
" Five shillings," said someone, at which there was a laugh.


---
" Who'll say a guinea?"


---
Nobody answered; and the female dealer in staylaces interposed.


---
Ah, what a cruelty
 is the poor soul married to!
---
Bed and board is dear at some figures' pon
 my' vation' tis!"


---
" Set it higher, auctioneer," said the trusser.


---
" Two guineas!" said the auctioneer; and
---
no one replied.


---
", in ten seconds they'll have
---
" Four guineas!" cried the auctioneer.


---
so that the basins danced
---
Susan, you agree?"


---
" Five guineas," said the auctioneer," or
---
" Yes," said a loud voice from the doorway.


---
All eyes were turned.
---
which formed

---
Standing in the triangular opening the door of the tent was a sailor, who, unobserved by the rest, had
 arrived there within the last two or three minutes.
---
" You say?"
---
you do
---
" I say so," replied the sailor.


---
" Saying is one thing, and
---
paying is another.
---
Where's the money?"


---
The sailor hesitated a moment,.
---
They were Bank- of- England notes for five pounds.
---
The sight of real money in full amount, in answer to a challenge for the
 same till then deemed slightly hypothetical had a great effect upon
 the spectators.
---
Their eyes became riveted upon the faces of the chief
 actors, and
---
then upon the notes as they lay,.


---
weighted by the shillings,
 on the table
---
Up to this moment it could not positively have been asserted.

---
The spectators had indeed taken the proceedings throughout as a piece of
 mirthful irony carried to extremes; and.
---
A lurid colour
 seemed, and.
---
The
 mirth- wrinkles left the listeners' faces, and
---
they waited with parting
 lips.


---
before you go further
---
If
 you touch that money
---
Mind, it is a
 joke no longer."


---
Of course it is not a joke!"
---
"; the sailor takes
 you.
---
That's plain enough.
---
It has been done elsewhere-- and why not here?"


---
"' Tis quite on the understanding," said
 the sailor blandly.
---
" That you swear?"
---
the bargain's complete," said
 the trusser.
---
" Mike I've lived with thee a couple of years, and!
---
' Twill be better for me and Elizabeth- Jane, both.
---
some of the guests laughed.


---
," said some rustics near the door.


---
Some others followed, and
---
they stood
.
---
The difference between the peacefulness of
 inferior nature and the wilful hostilities of mankind was very apparent
 at this place.
---
as they waited in patience to be harnessed
 for the homeward journey
---
Outside the fair, in the valleys and woods,
 all was quiet.
---
The sun had recently set, and
---
the west heaven was hung
 with rosy cloud, which seemed permanent,.
---
To watch
 it was like looking at some grand feat of stagery from a darkened
 auditorium.
---
till it was remembered
---
that all terrestrial conditions were
 intermittent, and
---
that mankind might some night be innocently sleeping

---
when these quiet objects were raging loud
---
" Where do the sailor live?".


---
" God knows."
---
who had seen high life
---
And then' a stepped back, and
---
then' a
 looked in again.
---
," said the staylace vendor.
---
," said another of a more
 deliberative turn.
---
which is
---
what not been used to lately, by all showings
---
if it
 were
---
Perhaps from some little sense of having countenanced an indefensible
 proceeding, perhaps because it was late
---
, the customers thinned away
 from the tent shortly after this episode.
---
The furmity seller decided, and after
 seeing the rum- bottles, milk, corn, raisins, etc.
---
, that remained on
 hand,,.
---
As the tent was
---
who was obviously no tramp
---
The morning sun was streaming through the crevices of the canvas.
---
A warm glow pervaded the whole atmosphere of the marquee,
 and a single big blue fly buzzed musically round and round it.
---
Besides
 the buzz of the fly there was not a sound.
---
A confused picture of the events of the previous evening seemed, and
---
A rustling
 revealed.


---
the sailor's bank- notes thrust carelessly in
---
they were not dreams
---
We walked here, and
---
Yes, that's and

---
what's happened
---
here am I.
---
The freshness of the
 September morning inspired and.
---
when they arrived the night before
---
they had observed
 but little of the place;.
---
It
 exhibited itself as the top of an open down,.
---
bounded on one extreme by
 a plantation, and
---
approached by a winding road
---
which lent its name to the upland and the annual fair that was
 held thereon
---
The spot stretched downward into valleys, and
---
The whole scene lay under the rays of a newly risen
 sun, which had not as yet dried a single blade of the heavily dewed
 grass,.
---
the shadows of the yellow and red vans were projected far
 away,
---
thrown by the felloe of each wheel
---
those being elongated in shape
 to the orbit of a comet
---
who had remained
 on the ground
---
All the gipsies and showmen lay snug within their carts and tents or.
---
that revealed their presence
---
But
 the Seven Sleepers had a dog; and
---
that
 vagrants own
---
dogs of the mysterious breeds, that are as much like cats as dogs and as much like foxes
 as cats also lay about here.
---
A little one started up under one of the
 carts,.

---
This seemed.
---
which flitted about the hedges with straws
 in their bills
---
whose wearer had had the good fortune not to be included
 in the fair
---
that there was some sort of binding force in the
 transaction
---
that many times more before it happened, in the resigned
 tones of a fatalist
---
that meekness has done me more harm than the
 bitterest temper!"


---
The village was quite
 still.
---
, it being that motionless hour of rustic daily life which fills
 the interval between the departure of the field- labourers to their work,
 and the rising of their wives and daughters
---
the
 door being only latched.
---
which lay on the
 Communion- table
---
the hay- trusser arose,
 and
---
the
 housewife agreed.
---
which was done
---
The perplexing nature of the undertaking became apparent soon enough.

---
no such characters as those had anywhere been seen
 since the evening of the fair
---
it was equally in vain.
---
The truth was; and
---
it was probably for this reason
.


---
Weeks counted up to months, and
---
The highroad into the village of Weydon- Priors was again carpeted with
 dust.
---
The trees had put on as of yore their aspect of dingy green, and

---
where the Henchard family of three had once walked along, two persons
 not unconnected with the family.


---
The scene in its broad aspect had so much of its previous character,
 even to the voices and rattle from the neighbouring village down,
 that it might for that matter have been the afternoon following the
 previously recorded episode.
---
Change was
---
only to be observed in details;
 but here it was obvious.

---
that a long procession of years had passed by
---
who walked the road
---
it was considerably thinner than heretofore.

---
which is
 itself beauty,
---
They walked with joined hands, and
---
it could be perceived.
---
that this was
 the act of simple affection
---
Reaching the outskirts of the village they pursued the same track as
 formerly, and.
---
Here, too it was evident.
---
that the
 years had told
---
Certain mechanical improvements might have been noticed
 in the roundabouts and high- fliers, machines for testing rustic strength
 and weight, and in the erections devoted to shooting for nuts.
---
But the
 real business of the fair had considerably dwindled.
---
The new periodical
 great markets of neighbouring towns were beginning.
---
The pens for
 sheep, the tie- ropes for horses, were about half as long as they had
 been.
---
The stalls of tailors, hosiers, coopers, linen- drapers, and other
 such trades had almost disappeared, and
---
the vehicles were far less
 numerous.
---
" Why did we hinder our time by coming in here?
---
you wished
---
" Yes, my dear Elizabeth- Jane," explained the other."
---
" It was here."


---
Yes, you have told me so before.
---
" And it was here,
---
it told
 me
---
" That's!"
---
exactly what you have said a score of times before
---
It is not much use inquiring here for anybody
---
" the
 daughter observed,
---
you are the only one here to- day
 who was here all those years ago
---
The daughter looked in the direction signified.
---
The object pointed
.
---
kept hot by a smouldering wood fire beneath
---
It was indeed the former mistress of the furmity tent--.


---
who came up and
---
When the soi- disant widow
 had taken the basin of thin poor slop that stood for the rich concoction
 of the former time
---
, the hag opened a little basket behind the fire, and
!"


---
you know
---
two penn'orth--'twill make
---
it slip down like cordial
---
," You've seen better
 days?"


---
" Ah, ma'am-- well ye may say it!"
---
what it was
---
Ma'am you'd hardly believe.
---
Nobody could come,
.

---
nobody could go, without having a dish of Mrs. Goodenough's furmity
---
But Lord's my life-- the world's no memory;
 straightforward dealings do n't bring profit--'tis the sly and the
 underhand that get on in these times!"


---
Can you call to mind
---
The hag reflected, and
---
If it had been a big
 thing
---
that' t has been my lot to
 witness
---
Was it done quiet- like?"


---
, Lord bless ye
---
, we do n't gi'e

---
it head- room, we do n't, such as that.
---
The only reason is.
---
that it was by
---
's get on
---
Mother, do let-- it was hardly respectable.
---
for you to buy
 refreshments there
---
the lowest do."


---
The last time our relative visited this fair
---
It is a long, long way from here, and
---
it was many years
 ago, but
---
we'll go
---
With this they descended out of the fair, and.




4.



---
where they obtained a night's lodging
---
It had seemed, indeed folly.


---
It may seem strange to sophisticated minds that a sane young
 matron could believe in the seriousness of such a transfer; and.
---
not numerous other instances of the same belief the thing might
 scarcely be credited
---
When Elizabeth- Jane was about twelve
 years old
---
the three returned to England, and.


---
it was during this period
.
---
that the delusion had vanished for ever.


---
when the season came round
---
Elizabeth- Jane developed early into womanliness.
---
so that the
 rays streamed into its depths as into a hazel copse
---
There was an under- handsomeness in it,, and the
 casual disfigurements that resulted from the straitened circumstances of
 their lives.
---
They both were still in that strait- waistcoat of poverty from
.

---
The
 desire-- sober and repressed-- of Elizabeth- Jane's heart was indeed to
 see,.
---
The sailor, drowned or no, was probably now lost to them; and
---
if they found
---
In this attitude they proceeded on their journey,.
---
The
 strictest economy was indispensable.
---
Sometimes they might have been seen
 on foot, sometimes on farmers' waggons, sometimes in carriers' vans; and

---
thus they drew near to Casterbridge.
---
what it once had been
---
which showed that
---
It was on a Friday evening, near the middle of September and just before
 dusk,
---
that they reached the summit of a hill within a mile of the place
 they sought.
---
There were high banked hedges to the coach- road here,
 and
---
they mounted upon the green turf within, and.
---
The spot
 commanded a full view of the town and its environs.


---
" What an old- fashioned place it seems!
---
to be" said Elizabeth- Jane,.
---
" It is huddled
 all together; and
---
it is shut in by a square wall of trees, like a plot
 of garden ground by a box- edging."


---
Its squareness was, indeed, the characteristic which most struck the eye
 in this antiquated borough, the borough of Casterbridge-- at that time,
 recent as it was,
---
It
 was compact as a box of dominoes.
---
It had no suburbs-- in the ordinary
 sense.
---
Country and town met at a mathematical line.


---
held together by a rectangular frame of deep green
---
To the
 level eye of humanity it stood as an indistinct mass behind a dense
 stockade of limes and chestnuts,.
---
The mass became gradually dissected by the
 vision into towers, gables, chimneys, and casements,.


---
the highest
 glazings shining bleared and bloodshot with the coppery fire they caught
 from the belt of sunlit cloud in the west
---
It was by one of these avenues.
---
that the
 pedestrians were about to enter
---
Before they had risen
---
as they receded
---
" Dear me-- why should you think that, mother?"


---
"' Twas just something to say-- that's all!
---
But we must make private
 inquiries."


---
they proceeded on their way at evenfall
---
The
 dense trees of the avenue rendered the road dark as a tunnel,
---
though the
 open land on each side was still under a faint daylight
---
, in other words,
 they passed down a midnight between two gloamings.
---
as they had wandered about
---
As soon they could see.
---
which framed in Casterbridge
---
that
 the stockade of gnarled trees was itself
 an avenue,
---
these external features were but
 the ancient defences of the town, planted as a promenade.


---
The lamplights now glimmered through the engirdling trees,.
---
The difference between burgh
 and champaign was increased, too, by sounds which now reached them above
 others-- the notes of a brass band.
---
The travellers returned into the High
 Street, where there were timber houses with overhanging stories,
.
---
whose small- paned lattices were screened by dimity curtains on a
 drawing- string, and
---
under whose bargeboards old cobwebs waved in the
 breeze
---
There were houses of brick- nogging, which derived their chief
 support from those adjoining.
---
There were slate roofs patched with tiles,
 and tile roofs patched with slate, with occasionally a roof of thatch.


---
upon whom the town
 depended for its existence
---
The agricultural and pastoral character of the people was shown by the class of objects displayed
 in the shop windows.
---
They came to a grizzled church, whose massive square tower rose unbroken
 into the darkening sky,.
---
the lower parts being illuminated by the nearest
 lamps sufficiently to show how completely the mortar from the joints
 of the stonework had been nibbled out by time and weather, which had
 planted in the crevices
---
From this tower the clock
 struck eight, and
---
thereupon a bell began.
---
The curfew was still rung in Casterbridge, and
---
it was utilized by
 the inhabitants as a signal for shutting their shops.
---
No sooner did the
 deep notes of the bell throb between the house- fronts than a clatter
 of shutters arose through the whole length of the High Street.
---
In a few
 minutes business at Casterbridge was ended for the day.


---
Other clocks struck eight from time to time-- one gloomily from the gaol,
 another from the gable of an almshouse, with a preparative creak of
 machinery, more audible than the note of the bell; a row of tall,
 varnished case- clocks from the interior of a clock- maker's shop joined
 in one after another just as the shutters were enclosing them, like a
 row of actors delivering their final speeches before the fall of the
 curtain
---
; then chimes were heard;
---
so that chronologists of the advanced school were appreciably on
 their way to the next hour before the whole business of the old one.


---
that they had
 an appetite
---
" Ye may as well look for manna- food as good bread in Casterbridge just
 now after directing them.
---
They can blare their trumpets
 and, and
---
where the brass band could be
 seen
---
There's less good bread than good
 beer in Casterbridge now."


---
" How does it happen?"
---
there's no good bread
---
that our millers and bakers all
 deal wi'
---
till the dough ran all over the ovens like
 quicksilver
---
so that the loaves be as flat as toads, and like suet
 pudden inside
---
But you must be
 a real stranger here not to know what's made all the poor volks' insides
 plim like blowed bladders this week?"


---
Getting a couple of biscuits at the shop indicated as a temporary
 substitute for a meal
---
, they next bent their steps instinctively to where
 the music was playing.




5.



---
A few score yards brought them to the spot where the town band was now
 shaking the window- panes with the strains of" The Roast Beef of Old
 England."


---
before whose doors they had pitched their music- stands
---
The building was
 the chief hotel in Casterbridge-- namely, the King's Arms.
---
A spacious
 bow- window projected into the street over the main portico, and from the
 open sashes came the babble of voices, the jingle of glasses, and the
 drawing of corks.
---
The blinds, moreover, being left unclosed, the whole
 interior of this room could be surveyed from the top of a flight of
 stone steps to the road- waggon office opposite, for which reason a knot
 of idlers had gathered there.


---
" We might, perhaps, after all, make a few inquiries about-- our
 relation Mr. Henchard
---
this would be a good place for trying it--
---
you know
---
You,
 Elizabeth- Jane, had better be the one to do it.
---
" What's going on to- night?"
---
" Well, ye must be a stranger sure
---
As
 we plainer fellows bain't invited
---
, they leave the winder- shutters open
.
---
that we may get jist a sense out here
---
If you mount the steps you
 can see em.
---
when they begun life
---
Ah, lots of them
 were no more than I be now!"


---
That laugh was not encouraging to strangers, and
---
hence it may have been
 well.
---
that it was rarely heard
---
Many theories might have been built upon
 it.
---
It fell in well with conjectures of a temperament which would have
 no pity for weakness, but.
---
Its producer's personal goodness,, would be of a very fitful cast-- an occasional almost oppressive
 generosity rather than a mild and constant kindness.


---
while the third, a tumbler, was half full of
 water
---
Time, the magician, had wrought much here.
---
it is
 enough for me!
---
that you should have said
---
Did ever anything go more by contraries!
---
, now we have got here and all!
---
where
 you be a little while
---
The younger guests were talking and
---
eating with animation; their
 elders were searching for titbits, and.
---
Three drinks seemed.


---
outside which old- established
 trinity few or no palates ranged
---
A row of ancient rummers with ground figures on their sides, and each
 primed with a spoon
---
these were

---
But
 Elizabeth- Jane noticed.


---
though this filling went on with great
 promptness up and down the table
---
that,, nobody filled the Mayor's glass, who
 still drank large quantities of water from the tumbler behind the clump
 of crystal vessels intended for wine and spirits
---
" Ah, no; do n't ye know that name?
---
has bode by it ever since
---
I have heard, and. knowing it would be unbecoming in the face of that: for
 yer gospel oath is a serious thing."


---
" Another two year, they say.
---
a never has told anybody
---
But' tis exactly
 two calendar years longer, they say.
---
But there's great strength in hope.
---
that in
 four- and- twenty months' time ye'll be out of your bondage, and able to
 make up for all you've suffered, by partaking without stint--
---
And' a must need such
 reflections-- a lonely widow man
---
that's.
---
when' a came here
---
that growed out that ye

---
could a'most call it malt, and
---
The band now struck up another melody, and
---
by the time it was ended, and
---
the
 dinner was over
---
speeches began.
---
The evening being calm,
 and
---
the windows still open
---
, these orations could be distinctly heard.

---
hilarity was general
---
till a new voice arose with
---
It came from the lower end of the table, where there sat a group of
 minor tradesmen who, although part of the company, appeared to be a
 little below the social level of the others; and
---
who seemed;.


---
just as the west end of a church
 is sometimes persistently found
---
This interruption about the bad bread afforded infinite satisfaction to
 the loungers outside, several of whom were in the mood which finds its
 pleasure in others' discomfiture; and
---
hence they echoed pretty freely,

---
who shared the feast
---
Moreover, feeling none of the
 restraints of those, they could afford!"


---
You
 rather ought
---
The interruption was sufficient to compel the Mayor to notice it.


---
that the wheat turned out badly
---
who had
---
" You must make allowances for the accidents of a large business
---
" You must bear in mind.
---
that the weather just at the harvest of
 that corn was worse than we have known it for years
---
you will find."


---
these mistakes will no longer occur
---
-- matters will be

---
" But are you going?
---
who seemed."
---
Will
 you replace the grown flour we've still got by sound grain?"


---
If anybody will tell me
---
But it ca n't be done."


---
Now the group outside the window had within the last few minutes
---
been
 reinforced by new arrivals, some of them respectable shopkeepers and
 their assistants, who had come out for a whiff of air after putting up
 the shutters for the night; some of them of a lower class.
---
But the subject seemed,
 and
---
It ca n't be done
---
It was quaint and northerly.


---
The waiter took the note, while the young stranger continued--

" And
---
can ye tell me of a respectable hotel that's a little more moderate
 than this?"


---
The waiter glanced indifferently up and down the street.


---
" They say,."


---
the Three Mariners, just below here, is a very good place
---
it was over
---
Elizabeth- Jane saw
 with some interest the note brought into the dining- room and handed to
 the Mayor.


---
Thereupon it was curious to note an unexpected effect.
---
The
 nettled, clouded aspect, changed itself into one
 of arrested attention.
---
who has been captured
 by an idea
---
By this time toasts and speeches had given place to songs,
---
the wheat
 subject being quite forgotten.
---
which
 reached convulsive grimace
---
Some were beginning.
---
as if they did

---
how they had come there
---
, what they had come for, or
---
they
 were going
---
who had dined with extreme thoroughness
---
whilst the heads of a few
 were somehow sinking into their
 shoulders, the corners of their mouth and eyes being bent upwards by the
 subsidence
---
The clock struck nine.
---
The
 evening is drawing on, mother
---
" do you propose?"


---
We must
 get a place to lie down in
---
that's all I wanted to do."


---
" That's enough for to- night, at any rate
---
," Elizabeth- Jane replied
 soothingly.
---
" We can think.
---
The
 question now is
---
-- is it not?--
---
how shall we find a lodging?"


---
that the Three Mariners was an inn of moderate charges
---
A
 recommendation good for one person was probably good for another."
---
's
 go
---
What
 do you say?"


---
In the meantime the Mayor's thoughtfulness, engendered by the note;
---
who had brought the note which had been handed in a quarter
 of an hour before
---
that the songs, toasts, and conversation were

---
The Corporation,
 private residents, and major and minor tradesmen had, in fact, gone
 in for comforting beverages to such an extent that they had quite
 forgotten, not only the Mayor, but all those vast, political, religious,
 and social differences which they felt necessary to maintain in the
 daytime, and which separated them like iron grills.
---
Very few persons were now in the street; and
---
whose interior was so popular among the frequenters of the
 inn
---
The bay window projecting into the
 street,, was closed with shutters, in each of which appeared a heart- shaped
 aperture.
---
A four- centred Tudor arch was over the entrance, and over the arch
 the signboard, now visible in the rays of an opposite lamp.
---
who had been represented by the artist as persons of two
 dimensions only-- in other words, flat as a shadow--
---
Hereon
 the Mariners, were standing in a
 row in paralyzed attitudes.
---
Being on the sunny side of the street the
 three comrades had suffered largely from warping, splitting, fading, and
 shrinkage,.
---
so that they were but a half- invisible film upon the reality
 of the grain, and knots, and nails, which composed the signboard
---
A long, narrow, dimly- lit passage gave access to the inn, within which
 passage the horses going to their stalls at the back, and.

---
their toes trodden upon by the animals
---
there being
---
The good stabling and the good ale of the Mariners, though somewhat
 difficult to reach on account of but this narrow way to
 both, were nevertheless perseveringly sought out by the sagacious old
 heads who knew what was what in Casterbridge.


---
Outside the house they had stood and.
---
whether even this homely
 place, though recommended as moderate, might not be too serious in its
 prices for their light pockets
---
Finally, however, they had found courage
 to enter, and.
---
who drew
 and
---
whose
 service was somewhat optional
---
where they sat
 down
---
The principle of the inn seemed, and
---
this
 had a dazzling effect upon the travellers.


---
-- we ca n't meet it!"
---
as they were left alone
---
it is, too
---
" But we must be respectable."


---
" We must pay our way
---
even before we must be respectable
---
for us to make
---
; so we've only our own pockets to depend on.
---
," said Elizabeth- Jane after an interval of waiting,
.
---
during which their needs seemed
---
As you seem busy here to- night, and
---
who remained
---
Such arrangements as the one were
 not uncommon in country villages; but,
---
though Casterbridge was
 old- fashioned
---
, the custom was well- nigh obsolete here.
---
A bell
 below tinkled a note that was feebler in sound than the twanging of
 wires and cranks that had produced it.


---
Now then, can you go and
---
If it is
---
Elizabeth- Jane, though hungry, willingly postponed, and.
---
The accommodation of the Three Mariners was far
 from spacious, despite the fair area of ground it covered.
---
demanded by intrusive beams and rafters, partitions, passages,
 staircases
---
The
 room, disused ovens, settles, and four- posters,.
---
before
 home- brewing was abandoned by the smaller victuallers, and
---
Moreover,, the quality of the liquor was the chief attraction
 of the premises,.
---
so that everything had
---
where the light caught it
---
that Elizabeth- Jane was rather tired,
---
Mrs.
 Stannidge thereupon said with a considerate peremptoriness.


---
if they meant
---
lips parted
---
The meaning of this was soon apparent.
---
as was evidenced by signs of a door of communication between
 them
---
But, as is
 frequently the case with hotels of far higher pretensions than the Three
 Mariners, every word spoken in either of these rooms
---
was distinctly
 audible in the other.
---
Such sounds came through now.


---
had been deferentially
 conducted upstairs by host Stannidge himself
---
that has excited my curiosity
---
" I merely strolled in on my way home to ask you a question about
 something," said the Mayor, with careless
 geniality.
---
you have not finished supper
---
Ye need n't go, sir.
---
" But I see."

 I will be done in a little! I've almost done, and it makes no difference at all."


---
did you write this
---
A rustling of paper
 followed.


---
" Well, first I should ask," Yes, I did," said the Scotchman.


---
, ha'n't you replied to an advertisement for a
 corn- factor's manager that I put into the paper--
---
ha'n't you come here to
?"


---
" No," said the Scotchman, with some surprise.


---
who arranged to

---
" You're wrong!"
---
It is
 true-- but
---
there is no scope for developing them heere."


---
The Scotchman murmured another negative, and
---
there was a silence,."


---
you wrote on that paper
---
" It was nothing, sir."


---
" Well, it has a great importance for me just now.
---
till the
 people came
---
if your renovating process will make it
 wholesome
---
, why, you can see.
---
what a quag' twould get me out of
---
in a moment there might be truth in it
---
of course you do n't care."


---
sufficiently for me to do that, without my paying ye well for't first
---
curing bad
 corn is not the line I'll take up there.
---
-- you'll make more out of it heere than I will in a foreign country.

---
Just look heere a minute, sir.
---
there was a sifting and rustling;

---
" These few grains will be sufficient to show ye with,
---
during which some operation seemed

---
to be intently watched by them both
---
" It's well-- nearly."


---
" Quite enough restored to make good seconds out of it," said the
 Scotchman.
---
To fetch it back entirely is impossible
---
"; Nature wo n't stand
 so much as that, but heere you go a great way towards it.
---
Well, sir,
 that's the process
---
for it can be
---
you know
---
" My business, is in corn
 and in hay, but
---
hay is
.

---
If you'll accept the place
---
, you shall manage the corn branch entirely,
 and."


---
, I do n't value it,; and I'll be
 only too glad if it's of service to you."

 I was brought up as a hay- trusser simply, and what I understand best though I now do more in corn than in the other" You're liberal-- very liberal, but
---
no, no-- I cannet!"" So be it!"
---
Now-- to change the subject-- one
 good turn deserves another
---
if this holds good for the bulk,
---
as it has done for the
 sample
---
, you have saved my credit, stranger
---
though you be
---
It may not prove necessary to ye, and
---
ye know
---
as you were in a difficulty
---
they were harrd upon ye."


---
And yet it turns out, after all,!"


---
; that's so
---
Your forehead, Farfrae, is something like my poor

---
You
 must be, what--
---
that
 strength and bustle build up a firm
---
But judgment and knowledge are.
---
it established
---
You are just the reverse
---
yet
 you are not for me.
---
Ca n't
 ye stay just the same?
---
Have you really made up your mind about this
 American notion?
---
you would be invaluable
 to me
---
that need n't be said-- and
---
if you will bide and
---
My plans are fixed
---
so we need.
---
But will you
 not drink with me, sir?
---
would, but
---
It made such an impression
 on me that I swore, there and then,.
---
" But it will be long!"


---
that
 would suit me so well
---
till they reached the door
---
" But no-- it cannet be!
---
Thus they parted; and
---
The quivering of the
 partition to its core presently denoted
---
to be attracted by the lively bursts
 of conversation and melody from the general company below
---
as it always was at this hour
---
the ground- floor serving
---
which was large
---
each fitted with its genial occupant
---
which, projecting endwise from the wall within
 the door
---
that went on

---
The young Scotchman had just joined the guests.
---
These, in addition to
 the respectable master- tradesmen occupying the seats of privileges in
 the bow- window and its neighbourhood, included an inferior set at the
 unlighted end, whose seats were mere benches against the wall, and who
 drank from cups instead of from glasses.
---
which would suddenly start off
---
There had been some singing; and

---
Elizabeth- Jane was fond of music
---
it was evident.
---
that the majority of the
 audience had not heard such frequently,
---
for they were attentive to a
 much greater degree than usual
---
They neither whispered, nor.
---
The singer himself grew emotional,
---
as the words went on:--

     
---
" It's hame, and hame fain
---
it's hame,
---
There's an eye that ever weeps, and
---
a fair face will be fain,
     
---
When the flower is in the bud, and the leaf upon the tree
---
;
     ,
      The lark shall sing me hame to my ain countree!"


---
There was a burst of applause, and a deep silence which was even more
 eloquent than the applause.
---
Then the ventilator in the window- pane spasmodically started off
 for a new spin, and
---
who was
 also present
---
's have it again, stranger
---
" Folks
 do n't lift up their hearts like that in this part of the world."
---
Scotch,
 d'ye say?
---
It was plain.

---
that nothing so
 pathetic had been heard at the Three Mariners for a considerable time
---
The difference of accent, the excitability of the singer, the intense
 local feeling, and the seriousness, surprised this set of worthies, who were only too prone to shut
 up their emotions with caustic words.


---
if our country down here is worth singing about like that
---
as the Scotchman again melodized with a dying
 fall," My ain countree
---
When you take away from among us the fools
 and the rogues, and the lammigers, and the wanton hussies, and the
 slatterns, and such like
---
", there's cust few left."


---
," said Buzzford, the dealer,.

---
" Casterbridge is a old, hoary place o' wickedness, by all account.'
---
Tis
 recorded in history; and
---
that we rebelled against the King one or two hundred
 years ago, in the time of the Romans, and
---
that lots of us was hanged
 on Gallows Hill, and, and
---
our different jints sent about the
 country like butcher's meat
---
for my part I can well believe it."

" What did ye come away from yer own country for, young maister, so wownded about it?"
---
if ye be

---
" Faith, it
 was n't worth your while on our account, for.
---
as Maister Billy Wills says,

---
We do n't
 think about flowers and fair faces, not we-- except in the shape o'
 cauliflowers and pigs' chaps."


---
None of
 ye has been stealing?"


---
that's travelled a'most from the
 North Pole."


---
we shall be here all night."


---
" That's all of it
---
," said the singer apologetically.


---
" Soul of my body, then we'll have another!"
---
said the general dealer.


---
" Can you turn a strain to the ladies, sir?"
---
" Let-- Mother Cuxsom.
---
," said the master glazier.


---
which awoke their sense of the ludicrous for the
 moment
---
Notwithstanding an
 occasional odd gravity, they began.
---
Casterbridge had
 sentiment
---
-- Casterbridge had romance; but
---
this stranger's sentiment was
 of differing quality.
---
Or rather, perhaps, the difference was mainly
 superficial
---
even Mrs. Stannidge managed
---
is trundled on the chine by a drayman without losing much of its
 perpendicular.


---
" And are you going, sir?
---
" I'm only passing thirrough! I am on my way to Bristol, and on frae
 there to foreign parts."

" We be truly sorry to hear it
---
when they fall among us
---
as we may say
---
where wolves and wild boars and
 other dangerous animalcules be as common as blackbirds here- about-- why,
' tis a thing we ca n't do every day; and
---
there's good sound information
 for bide- at- homes like we
---
" There are not perpetual
 snow and wolves at all in it!--except snow in winter, and
---
-- well-- a
 little in summer just sometimes, and a' gaberlunzie' or two stalking
 about here and there, if ye may call them dangerous.
---
Eh, but you should
 take a summer jarreny to Edinboro', and Arthur's Seat, and all round
 there, and and all the Highland scenery-- in May
 and June-- and
---
you would never say'!"


---
" Of course not-- it stands to reason
---
," said Buzzford.
---
that leads to such words
---
" And do ye carry your flock bed, and your quilt, and your crock, and
 your bit of chiney? or
---
do ye go in bare bones,
---
though it is n't much
---
Never a one of the prizes of life will I come by
---
in which Elizabeth- Jane shared not least
---
A general sense of regret,,
 made itself apparent in the company.
---
as the
 Casterbridge toss- pots had done
---
rightly not-- there was none.
---
that they were a tragical rather than a
 comical thing
---
though one could be gay on occasion
---
that, moments
 of gaiety were interludes, and no part of the actual drama
---
It was
 extraordinary how similar their views were.


---
Though it was still early
---
which was the act of a few moments only
---
characterized by earnestness and soberness of mien
---
Thus it happened

---
the Scotchman's
 voice died away,.


---
Here the scene and sentiment ended for the present.
---
We've made a mistake
---
what you did
---
who would perhaps have been more alarmed at this than
---
as things stood
---
" To be sure, to be sure, how that fellow does draw me!
---
When Elizabeth- Jane opened the hinged casement next morning.
---
Casterbridge was the complement of
 the rural life around, not its urban opposite.
---
who desired
---
Bees and butterflies in
 the cornfields at the top of the town, to get to the meads
 at the bottom, took no circuitous course, but.
---
that they were traversing
 strange latitudes
---
And in autumn airy spheres of thistledown floated
 into the same street, lodged upon the shop fronts, blew into drains,
 and innumerable tawny and yellow leaves skimmed along the pavement, and

---
one of which was close at hand
---
the Scotchman was
 looking from the window.
---
it appeared
---
" And you are off soon
---
" said Henchard upwards.


---
" Yes-- almost this moment, sir," said the other.
---
the coach makes up on me
---
ye are going
---
" Maybe I'll walk on till
."

" Then shall we walk together to the top o' town?"


---
If ye'll wait a minute
---
"," said the Scotchman.


---
In a few minutes the latter emerged, bag in hand.
---
It showed."
---
" Yes, yes-- it might have been wiser
---
that were furthest off
---
" It is only
."


---
my plans are vague
---
They had by this time passed on from the precincts of the inn,
 and
---
Elizabeth- Jane heard no more.
---
that they continued
 in conversation,
---
Thus they passed the King's Arms
 Hotel, the Market House, St. Peter's churchyard wall,;
.


---
till they were small as two grains of corn
---
when they bent suddenly to the right into the Bristol Road, and
---
The simple thought, with its latent sense of slight, had moulded itself
 out of the following little fact:; and
---
You are still thinking, mother
---
While they debated this question a procession of five large waggons
---
They came in from the
 country, and
---
the steaming horses had probably been travelling a great
 part of the night.
---
The discussion was continued during breakfast, and
---
the end of it was
.
---
were
 chiefly two things.
---
There was
 promise in both.


---
as Elizabeth- Jane stood
---
Then, sir, we would rather not intrude
---
; we will leave
 Casterbridge as quietly as we have come, and
---
Elizabeth- Jane went a few steps towards the landing."
---
It was about ten o'clock, and market- day,
---
The front doors
 of the private houses were mostly left open at this warm autumn time,
 no thought of umbrella stealers disturbing the minds of the placid
 burgesses.
---
, the mossy gardens at the
 back, glowing with nasturtiums, fuchsias, scarlet geraniums," bloody
 warriors," snapdragons, and dahlias, this floral blaze being backed by
 crusted grey stone- work remaining from a yet remoter Casterbridge than
 the venerable one visible in the street.
---
which had older than old- fashioned backs
---
The old- fashioned fronts of
 these houses,, rose sheer
 from the pavement, into which the bow windows protruded like bastions,
.
---
which spoke so cheerfully of
 individual unrestraint as to boundaries
---
In addition to these fixed obstacles, movables occupied the path and
 roadway to a perplexing extent.
---
who hailed from Mellstock, Weatherbury, The
 Hintocks, Sherton- Abbas, Kingsbere, Overcombe, and many other towns and
 villages round
---
Their owners were numerous enough to be regarded as a
 tribe, and.

---
Their vans had just arrived, and.
---
Moreover every shop pitched out half its
 contents upon trestles and boxes on the kerb,.
---
until there remained
 but a tortuous defile for carriages down the centre of the street, which
 afforded fine opportunities for skill with the reins
---
that had been modestly kept back from the
 general line
---
And any inviting
 recess in front of a house was utilized by pig- dealers as a pen for their stock.


---
who came to transact

---
The yeomen, farmers, dairymen, and townsfolk, business in these ancient streets, spoke in other ways than by
 articulation.
---
Not to hear the words of your interlocutor in metropolitan
 centres is.
---
Here the face, the arms, the
 hat, the stick, the body throughout spoke equally with the tongue.
---
which was intelligible from the other end of the street
---
; a sense of
 tediousness announced itself in a lowering of the person by spreading
 the knees to a lozenge- shaped aperture and contorting the arms.

---
Chicanery, subterfuge, had hardly a place in the streets of this honest
 borough to all appearance; and
---
it was said.


---
that the lawyers in the Court
 House hard by occasionally threw in strong arguments for the other side
 out of pure generosity( though apparently by mischance)
---
Thus Casterbridge was in most respects but the pole,;.

---
which are,
---
as foreign bodies set down
---
with which they have nothing in common
---
Casterbridge lived by agriculture at one remove further from the
 fountainhead than the adjoining villages-- no more.
---
The townsfolk
 understood every fluctuation in the rustic's condition,
---
for it affected
 their receipts as much as the labourer's
---
; they entered into the troubles
 and joys which moved the aristocratic families ten miles round-- for the
 same reason.
---
And even at the dinner- parties of the professional families
 the subjects of discussion were corn, cattle- disease, sowing and
 reaping, fencing and planting;.


---
while politics were viewed by them less
 from their own standpoint of burgesses with rights and privileges than
 from the standpoint of their country neighbours
---
which delighted the eye
 by their quaintness, and in a measure reasonableness,
---
All the venerable contrivances and confusions in this rare old
 market- town, were metropolitan novelties to the unpractised eyes of
 Elizabeth- Jane, fresh from netting fish- seines in a seaside cottage.

---
The
 front door was open, and,.


---
The door opened upon the yard, and
---
It was a place flanked by hay- barns, into
.
---
which tons of fodder, all in trusses, were being packed from the waggons

---
to which access was given by Flemish
 ladders
---
Wherever the doors of
 these places were open
---
, a closely packed throng of bursting wheat- sacks
 could be seen, with the air of awaiting a famine that
 would not come.


---
" Yes, what it is?"
---
" Ah, yes; will you wait a minute?
---
While Elizabeth- Jane sits
---
When the two new acquaintances had passed out of sight that morning
 towards the Bath and Bristol road they went on silently, except for a
 few commonplaces, till they had gone down an avenue on the town walls
 called the Chalk Walk, leading to an angle where the North and West
 escarpments met.
---
From this high corner of the square earthworks a vast
 extent of country could be seen.
---
A footpath ran steeply down the green
 slope,.
---
It was by this path the Scotchman had to descend.


---
" Well, here's success to' ee
---
which protected the descent
---
In the act there was the inelegance of one whose feelings are nipped and
 wishes defeated.
---
how you came
 at the very moment
---
a cause be lost for want of

---
before ye are gone for ever
---
Once more, will
 ye stay?
---
There it is, flat and plain.
---
You can see
---
that it is n't all
 selfishness
---
that makes
---
me press' ee
---
Others
 would do for the place without doubt.
---
Some selfishness perhaps there
 is, but
---
there is more
---
; it is n't.
---
for me to repeat what
---
" It's Providence!
---
Should
 any one go against it?
---
" Done," said Henchard.

" Done
---
Now you are my friend!"
---
's clinch it at once by clear terms,
---
You could n't have eaten much so
 early,
---
even if they had anything at that place to gi'e thee, which they
 had n't
---
we will have a solid, staunch tuck- in,
 and settle terms in black- and- white if you like; though my word's my
 bond
---
a splendid
 cold pigeon- pie going just now
---
You can have,."


---
if you
 want to
---
you know
---
" It is too airly in the morning for that
---
they returned, and
---
Here the matter was settled over the breakfast,
.
---
at least till some suitable
 lodgings could be found
---
The newcomer stepped forward like the quicker cripple
 at Bethesda, and.
---
as you did not keep your
 appointment
---
Do you think?"


---
when business is in question
---
" You said Thursday or Saturday, sir,
---
" said the newcomer,.


---
" Well, you are too late
---
," said the corn- factor.
---
But it ca n't be helped."


---
There was no more to be said, and
---
Elizabeth- Jane now entered, and.

---
which always seemed
---
though this could hardly be a physical fact
---
whether you would wish
---
" What-- do you call yourself-- your Christian name?"


---
as this is
 not a matter of business, but pleasure,
---
we go indoors
---
It
 was furnished to profusion with heavy mahogany furniture of the deepest
 red- Spanish hues.
---
leaves hanging so low that they
 well- nigh touched the floor,
---
Pembroke tables, with stood against the walls on legs and feet

---
the chairs were of
 the kind which, since that day, has cast lustre upon the names of
 Chippendale and Sheraton, though, in point of fact
---
, their patterns may
 have been.


---
such as those illustrious carpenters never saw or
---
We have been in England some years.
---
when we came here
 from Canada
---
These things being
 clear
---
We must have a long talk
 together-- but not just now."


---
who had
 known so little friendship
---
Perhaps these are impostors-- and Susan and the child dead after all!"


---
" It never rains but
---
it pours!
---
It
 ran thus:--


".
---
if you can
---
The place is easy to find.
---
The
 news upsets me almost.
---
The amount was
 significant
---
The Ring at Casterbridge was merely the local name of one of the finest
 Roman Amphitheatres, if not the very finest, remaining in Britain.


---
Casterbridge announced old Rome in every street, alley, and precinct.

---
It looked Roman,.
---
It
 was impossible.
---
who would have felt an unpleasantness at the
 discovery of a comparatively modern skeleton in their gardens
---
Imaginative inhabitants,, were
 quite unmoved by these hoary shapes.
---
They had lived so long ago
---
, their
 time was so unlike the present,
---
their hopes and motives were so widely
,
---
The Amphitheatre was a huge circular enclosure, with a notch at opposite
 extremities of its diameter north and south.
---
From its sloping internal
 form it might have been called the spittoon of the Jotuns.
---
It was to
 Casterbridge, and.
---
what the ruined Coliseum is to modern Rome
---
The dusk of evening was the proper hour at which
 a true impression of this suggestive place could be received.
---
Standing
 in the middle of the arena at that time there by degrees became apparent
 its real vastness, which a cursory view from the summit at noon- day

---
was apt to obscure.
---
Melancholy, impressive, lonely, yet accessible from
 every part of the town, the historic circle was the frequent spot for
 appointments of a furtive kind.
---
Intrigues were arranged there
---
; tentative
 meetings were there experimented after divisions and feuds.
---
But one kind
 of appointment-- in itself the most common of any-- seldom had place in
 the Amphitheatre: that of happy lovers.


---
that it was pre- eminently an airy, accessible, and
 sequestered spot for interviews,
---
Why, seeing the cheerfullest form of those
 occurrences never took kindly to the soil of the ruin
---
Perhaps it was.
---
because its associations had about them
 something sinister
---
Its history proved that.
---
Tradition reports.
---
In addition to these old tragedies, pugilistic
 encounters almost to the death had come off down to recent dates in that
 secluded arena, entirely invisible to the outside world save by climbing
 to the top of the enclosure, which few towns- people in the daily round
 of their lives ever took the trouble to do.
---
So that, though close to the
 turnpike- road, crimes might be perpetrated there unseen at mid- day.


---
But the game usually languished
 for the aforesaid reason-- the dismal privacy which the earthen circle
 enforced, shutting out every appreciative passer's vision, every
 commendatory remark from outsiders-- everything, except the sky; and
---
to
 play at games in such circumstances was like acting to an empty house.

---
, for some old people said.


---
, in broad daylight, persons sitting
 with a book or dozing in the arena had, on lifting their eyes, beheld
 the slopes lined with a gazing legion of Hadrian's soldiery as if
 watching the gladiatorial combat; and,
---
that at
 certain moments in the summer time had heard the roar of their
 excited voices that the scene would remain but a moment, like a
 lightning flash, and
---
It was related.
---
that there still remained under the south entrance
 excavated cells for the reception of the wild animals and athletes who
 took part in the games
---
The arena was still smooth and circular,.
---
by which spectators had ascended to their seats
---
The sloping pathways
 were pathways yet.
---
But
 the whole was grown over with grass, which now, at the end of summer,
 was bearded with withered bents that formed waves under the brush of the
 wind,.


---
till some definite course had been decided on
---
entered by
 the south path which descended over the debris of the former dens
---
They met in the middle of the arena.

---
Neither spoke just at first
---
" You hear,
 Susan?--
---
you were living
---
But there was every reason to
.
---
you and the child were dead and
---
My opinion at last was.
---
Why did you keep silent like this?"


---
there was something solemn and binding in the bargain
---
that you may be sure
---
How could you be so simple?"


---
Yet it would have been very wicked--!"
---
" Yes-- yes-- so it would.
---
" That was.
---
You have heard and

---
how you two can return openly to my house, and
---
there's the rub
 o't."


---
" We'll go away at once.
---
; you are not
---
to go-- you mistake me!"
---
Elizabeth- Jane coming to my house as
 my step- daughter.
---
The thing is so natural and easy that it is half done
 in thinking o't.
---
; the secret would be yours and mine
 only; and."


---
if you tell me, and
---
" Now, now; we do n't want
---
" Of course
 you wo n't leave again.
---
if you ca n't hit upon a better one
---
we'll adopt it.
---
during that
 time you can get lodgings-- the only ones in the town fit for you are
 those over the china- shop in High Street-- and
---
you can also look for a
 cottage."


---
If the lodgings are in High Street
---
they are dear
---
"

" Never mind-- you MUST start genteel.

---
if our plan is
---
" And are you comfortable at the inn?"


---
that's."


---
what makes me most anxious of all
---
" It seems the only right course, after all this.
---
that our kinsman, Mr.
 Henchard, kindly wishes
---
us to stay in the town
---
"-- it is not late.
---
me go alone
---
Do you forgive me, Susan?"


---
there being no blind
---
you, if ye will stay so late."


---
which had been allowed
---
The
 corn- factor's mien was, and
---
You shall do no more to- night
---
" There's time enough to- morrow.
---
Now you shall!
---
They locked up the office, and
---
The garden was silent, dewy, and full of
 perfume.
---
It extended a long way back from the house, first as lawn and
 flower- beds, then as fruit- garden, where the long- tied espaliers, as old
 as the old house itself, had grown so stout, and cramped, and gnarled
 that they had pulled their stakes out of the ground and stood distorted
 and writhing in vegetable agony, like leafy Laocoons.
---
The flowers which
 smelt so sweetly were not discernible; and
---
they passed through them into
 the house.


---
The hospitalities of the morning were repeated, and
---
when they were over

---
's make a blaze
---
there's nothing I hate like a black grate, even
 in September
---
a cheerful
 radiance spread around.


---
It is odd
---
as we have done on
 a purely business ground
---
nobody else to speak to
---
flanked by heads of Apollo and
 Diana in low relief
---
Would you think me a married man?"


---
that you were a widower
---
" Ah, yes-- you would naturally have heard that.
---
This is.

---
how it came about
---
We came to a booth in a
 country fair.
---
which had at first been visible in the
 Scotchman
---
The tinge of indifference now disappeared.


---
And what's?
---
" That's.
---
" Ye do n't say that?"


---
It has been my custom
 for many years to run across to Jersey in the the way of business,
 particularly in the potato and root season.
---
that you never may, young man
---
This young creature was staying at the boarding- house where
 I happened to have my lodging; and
---
Heaven knows.
---
It is enough to say that we
 honestly meant to marry.
---
There arose a scandal, which did me no harm,
 but.
---
that philandering with womankind
 has neither been my vice nor my virtue
---
it
 was through this.
---
that the scandal arose
---
we should

---
Even after that
 wrong- doing at the fair, as to let, all might now be well.
---
as it stands
---
it is the second.
---
-- there's no doubt about that.
---
" They are both in a very melancholy position, and
---
that's true!"
---
" They are!
---
" Ah, well, it cannet be helped!"
---
said the other, with philosophic
 woefulness.
---
You mun write to the young lady, and
---
in your letter you
 must put it plain and honest
---
that it turns out
---
the first having come back
---
" That wo n't do.'
---
Od seize it
---
Now, will you help me
 in this, and?
---
as you can
---
Now what would you do?--
---
it will not only help us to
, but
---
it will be more proper.
---
the interview ended,
---
as
 the Scotchman left
---
You see now."


---
that the Mayor of Casterbridge is not so

---
as it seems
---
" Can it be!"
---
that it will go off so easily
---
" Poor thing-- God
 knows!
---
The cottage-- was in the upper or western
 part of the town, near the Roman wall, and the avenue which overshadowed
 it.
---
The evening sun seemed.
---
as the hours grew later, under
 the lowest sycamore boughs,
---
which the
 foliage screened from the upper parts
---
One afternoon the daughter was not indoors, and
---
This is a very good opportunity for me to ask you to name
 the happy day, Susan
---
But the flesh is weak; and
---
the true
 explanation came in due course.


---
This is only a
 cottage
---
"-- it costs me next to nothing.
---
that it soon
 became, and
---
that the
 masterful, coercive Mayor of the town was raptured and
---
enervated by the
 genteel widow Mrs. Newson
---
for it was known
---
that
 they were related in some way
---
when
 they passed together along the Walks
---
as the avenues on the walls
 were named
---
It was a windless
 morning of warm November rain, which floated down like meal, and lay
 in a powdery form on the nap of hats and coats.
---
Few people had
 gathered round the church door.

---
though they were
---
who assisted as groomsman
---
The Scotchman,, was of course the only one
 present, beyond the chief actors, who knew the true situation of the
 contracting parties.
---
But they knew nothing of the secret;.


---
as the
 time for coming out of church drew on
---
though,, they gathered on the pavement
 adjoining, and
---
" Be cust," replied that
 lady."
---
As for thee, Christopher, we know, and
---
what ye be
---
the less said
 the better.
---
a was a poor parish' prentice
---
a was a poor parish' prentice-- I would n't say it for all the world-- but
' a was a poor parish' prentice,
---
that began life wi' no more belonging to
' en than a carrion crow
---
who had asked for another song
 at the Three Mariners
---
Well, Mother Cuxsom how's this?

---
Ah, yes, Cuxsom's gone, and
---
Where the pigs be."


---
many the wash runs thin
---
we used,,
---
as one may say
---
how Joan Dummett was took bad, and
---
when we were coming
 home
---
Jack Griggs was forced; and
---
how
' a let in Dairyman Sweet- apple's cow- barton, and?"


---
we had
---
as there was in them ancient days
---
" Well-- there's a difference between'em,
---
There's a blue- beardy look about' en; and
---
Some folk want.
---
their luck buttered
---
The plain little brougham drove off in the mist, and
---
the idlers
 dispersed."
---
Well, we hardly know!"
 
---
it was as
 bright.
---
as such summers well can be
---
churchwarden could possibly be.
---
The house was large, the
 rooms lofty, and the landings wide; and
---
as the mediaeval saying puts it
---
With peace of mind came
 development, and with development beauty.
---
this
 was infrequent
---
which looked from their pupils
---
the sort of wisdom did

---
who
 have known rough times
---
how it
 came there
---
It might have been supposed
---
To
 keep in the rear of opportunity in matters of indulgence is as valuable
 a habit as to keep abreast of opportunity in matters of enterprise.
---
" It would
 be tempting Providence, and."


---
it plain edged, with a little ivory ring for
 keeping it closed
---
It was odd about the necessity for that sunshade.
---
Od send-- nothing to say
 to't!"


---
that arched like
 a white rainbow from ear to ear
---
The three members of the family were sitting at breakfast one day, and

---
Elizabeth- Jane's hair-- didn't you tell me?"
---
that Elizabeth- Jane's hair
 promised
---
" Begad,
 I nearly forgot myself just now!
---
was."


---
as if it would be darker
---
" It did; but
---
they alter so
---
" Their hair gets darker
---
It passed:

" Well, so much the better.
---
' people do it already in
 carelessness
---
-- that's the way they do it.
---
Surely,, you must wish it as much as I?"


---
us do it by all means
---
; it might have been
 called falsely, but.
---
Can you
 agree--
---
Do you wish this change so very much,
 sir?"
---
-- that's all.
---
what you do
---
, you understand,
---
Now do n't' ee
 go."


---
Here the subject dropped, and
---
nothing more was said, and.


---
nothing was

---
conducted by Henchard throve

---
It had formerly moved in jolts
---
; now it went on oiled casters.
---
bargains were made by the tongue alone,.
---
Letters and ledgers took the place of" I'll do't," and" you shall
 hae't"; and,.


---
as in all such cases of advance, the rugged picturesqueness
 of the old method disappeared with its inconveniences
---
that it commanded a view of the hay- stores and granaries across the
 garden--
---
what went
 on there
---
the latter looking quite innocent and not laughing at
 all
---
as they
 stood in the doorway between the garden and yard
---
what's all the world!

---
ye'll drive me crazy
---
Casterbridge, as has been hinted, was a place deposited in the
 block upon a corn- field.
---
There was no suburb in the modern sense, or
 transitional intermixture of town and down.
---
It stood, with regard to the
 wide fertile land adjoining, clean- cut and distinct, like a chess- board
 on a green tablecloth.
---
The corn grown on the upland side of the borough
---
was garnered by farmers
 who lived in an eastern purlieu called Durnover.
---
Barns
 indeed were so numerous as to alternate with every half- dozen houses
 along the way.
---
who daily walked the fallow
---
ruled by a mayor and corporation,
---
which had nothing urban in it whatever
---
when arrangements were in progress for getting home corn from
 one of the aforesaid farms
---
One day,, Elizabeth- Jane received a note by hand,
.
---
The granary
 was just within the farm- yard, and.
---
The gates were open, but
---
nobody was within.

---
By some unaccountable shyness, some wish
---
This situation began, and
---
it became
---
you were there
---
it was you

---
who wished
---
" Did n't you ask me?
---
Did n't you write this?"
---
you ask me?
---
This is not your writing?"
---
" And is that really so!
---
Then it's.

---
somebody wanting
---
Perhaps we would do well."


---
they lingered
---
Acting on this consideration, Elizabeth- Jane's face being
 arranged to an expression of preternatural composure, and the young
 Scot,.
---
They watched individual drops of rain creeping down the
 thatch of the opposite rick-- straw after straw--; but
---
till they reached the
 bottom
---
nobody came, and
---
the granary roof began.


---
" The person is not likely to be coming
---
" It's a trick
 perhaps, and
---
if so, it's a great pity, and
."


---
" It's true, Miss Newson.
---
We'll hear news of this.
---
some day depend on't,
 and
---
who it was
---
that did it
---
for it hindering myself
---
but you, Miss Newson----"

" I do n't mind-- much."


---
" Neither do I."


---
They lapsed again into silence.
---
You are anxious to get back to
 Scotland
---
you might be from the song you sang at the Three
 Mariners-- about Scotland and home, I mean-- which you seemed to feel so
 deep down in your heart
---
so that we all felt for you."


---
well you feel a song for a few minutes, and

---
your eyes they get quite tearful
---
you finish it, and
---
you do n't mind it or
---
whenever you like
---
Then, Miss Newson, ye had better say nothing about this hoax, and
.
---
if the person should say anything to you
---
as if you did not mind it
---
-- so you'll take the
 clever person's laugh away."
---
" There's husks and dust on you.

---
Perhaps you do n't know it?"
---
And
 it's very bad.

---
rain come upon clothes
---
when there's chaff on them
---
It washes in and.
---
me help you--
---
blowing is the best
---
in no manner of hurry to
 be gone
---
was now attracted by the Mayor's so- called step- daughter, but
---
The truth is:" The virgin that loveth to go gay."


---
But nothing is more insidious
 than the evolution of wishes from mere fancies, and of wants from mere
 wishes.
---
It was now absolutely necessary
---
the
 whole structure was at last complete.


---
Everybody was attracted, and
---
some said, and
---
it had been done on purpose.

---
As a matter of fact this was not true, but
---
it had its result;.
---
It
 is the first time in my life that I have been so much admired
---
though perhaps it is by those whose admiration is not worth
 having
---
altogether the time was an
 exciting one
---
" can it be?
---
There is something wrong in all this
---
If they only knew
---
they
 learn at boarding schools
---
how they would despise me
---
that was now so generally observable
 in their intercourse
---
as evinced by these two
---
that
 was
---
And yet the seed to lift the foundation of this friendship was at that moment.


---
It was about six o'clock
---
what was coming next
---
You see, and

---
what's
---
you hear, and
---
you know
---
which
 lifted the sacks, or
---
who had
---
that had been purchased
---
It now remained to- morrow.


---
what would
 happen
---
Six o'clock struck, and
---
that this was the last time
---
" There is
---
whereas my poor dumb brain gets as dead as
 a clot afore
---
Yes-- it came on as a
 stripling, just afore
---
if you're not here
---
me clear up my points
---
then' a would n't hear my
 points
---
to be taken by the waggons next day
---
The journey was a long one into
 Blackmoor Vale, and
---
at four o'clock lanterns were moving about the yard.

---
nothing else will do him any good!
---
because the inmates had
 nothing to lose
---
I've said Now I'll carry out my word, by
 my blessed fathers-- I'm going up that
 way."

" Out of bed, sir, and off to the granary, or you leave my employ to- day!
'
---
Tis to teach ye a lesson.
---
" For maircy's sake, what object's this?"
---
" Ye see, Mr. Farfrae," gibbered Abel with a resigned smile of terror,

---
Ye see,
---
it ca n't be helped
---
Yes-- I'll go to Blackmoor Vale half naked as

---
for the women- folk will be looking out of their
 winders at my mortification all the way along, and
---
You know
---
it coming on
---
If ye go not
---
, you'll!"


---
your death standing there
---
this joke has been carried far enough
---
it has n't
---
their eyes met.
---
It is tyrannical and no worthy of you."


---
" It is!"
---
" Why did you speak to me before them like that, Farfrae
---
You might have

---
till we were alone
---
if some oats should be
 hoisted to an upper floor or not
---
; there could be no doubt of it.
---
One day the daughters of a deceased farmer in Durnover wanted
 an opinion of the value of their haystack, and.
---
who was a child
---
The messenger,, met
 in the yard not Farfrae, but Henchard.

" Very well
---
said the child.


---
-- that's
---
what they say
---
that's--
---
what they say
---
" Yes-- that's just it, sir-- some of it."


---
" Oh, there's more?
---
Of course there's more!
---
they say.

---
And they said,'
---
says they.
---
And they said,'.
---
they
 said
---
I wish,'." They'll talk any nonsense
---
Well,
 you can go now.
---
do
 they
---
They walked on
 together,.


---
" You're no yoursel' the day?"
---
But ye are a bit down
---
-- surely ye are down?
---
Why, there's nothing to be
 angry about!'
---
that we've got from Blackmoor Vale
---
By
 the by, the people in Durnover want.
---
their hay valued
---
" Do you care so very much about hurting folks' feelings?"
---
" You do, I know-- especially mine!"


---
Why should you say it
---
that made me
 short in my manner
---
"' Twas-- made.
---
me overlook
---
what you really are
---
to go in here about this hay-- Farfrae, you can do it better than I.

---
They sent for' ee, too.
---
' tis drawing on for't."


---
They parted thus in renewed friendship,.
---
yet,, it was with a dim dread; and
---
But in the daily routine of their business there was
 little change.


---
Thus their lives rolled on.


---
till a day of public rejoicing was suggested
 to the country at large in celebration of a national event that had
 recently taken place
---
as you like
---
what should be done on

---
However, it was not too late; and
---
To this they quite readily agreed
---
, the majority being fine old crusted
 characters who had a decided taste for living without worry.


---
the Mayor intended
---
The diversions which to provide were.


---
Everybody applauded the Mayor's proposed entertainment,.


---
especially when
 it became
---
surrounded by an ancient
 square earthwork--
---
that required more
 space than the streets would afford
---
On one side it sloped to the river
 Froom, and
---
from any point a view was obtained of the country round
 for many miles.
---
This pleasant upland was.


---
that
 games of all sorts would take place here; and
---
They erected greasy- poles for
 climbing, with smoked hams and local cheeses at the top.
---
They placed
 hurdles in rows for jumping over;.
---
across the river they laid a slippery
 pole, with a live pig of the neighbourhood tied at the other end, to

---
who could walk over and
---
The tables were laid parallel with the inner
 slope of the rampart, and
---
awnings were stretched overhead.


---
The morning came.
---
which had been remarkably clear down to
 within a day or two
---
The sky,, was overcast, and
---
the weather threatening, the wind
.
---
But it was
 too late to modify or postpone, and
---
the proceedings went on.
---
At twelve
 o'clock the rain began.
---
that it was difficult
---
exactly when dry
 weather ended or
---
wet established itself
---
In an hour the slight moisture
 resolved itself into a monotonous smiting of earth by heaven, in
 torrents to which no end could be prognosticated.


---
A number of people had heroically gathered in the field but.
---
The hams at the top of the poles dripped watered smoke in the
 form of a brown liquor
---
, the pig shivered in the wind,
---
the grain of the
 deal tables showed through the sticking tablecloths, for the awning
.
---
the rain to drift under at its will
---
to enclose the sides
 at this hour seemed a useless undertaking
---
The landscape over the
 river disappeared
---
; the wind played on the tent- cords in aeolian
 improvisations, and
---
that the whole
 erection slanted to the ground
---
who had taken shelter within it

---
But towards six the storm abated, and
---
a drier breeze shook the moisture
 from the grass bents.
---
It seemed possible.
---
The awning was set up again
---
; the band was called out from its
 shelter, and and
---
where the tables had stood a place

---
was cleared for dancing.


---
" But where are the folk?"
---
" The shops are all shut.
---
Why do n't they come?"


---
," answered a Councilman
 who stood in the field with the Mayor.


---
But where are the body
---
One or two young fellows gallantly came; but
---
as there
 were no spectators, and.
---
the entertainment closed, the food to be distributed
 among the poor people of the town
---
In a short time nothing was left in
 the field but a few hurdles, the tents, and the poles.


---
It was now dusk.
---
that the tendency of all
 promenaders was towards a particular spot in the Walks, and
---
that a gigantic tent had been
 ingeniously constructed without poles or ropes
---
The densest point of the
 avenue of sycamores had been selected,;
---
where the boughs made a closely
 interlaced vault overhead
---
to these boughs the canvas had been hung, and

---
a barrel roof was the result.
---
The end towards the wind was enclosed
---
, the
 other end was open.
---
In form it was like the nave of a cathedral with one gable removed, but

---
the scene within was anything but devotional.
---
A reel or fling of some
 sort was in progress; and
---
when this exhibition was
 over, and, and
---
a new dance proposed
---
All the town crowded to the Walk, such a delightful idea of a ballroom
 never having occurred to the inhabitants before.
---
as
 if Nature had been advised by Correggio in their creation
---
The dancing
 progressed with unabated spirit, and Henchard walked and.
---
it was worse, remarks of a kind which were becoming too frequent
---
to keep in the
 light," said one.

---
The other answered.
---
that people said
---
it was not only in such things as
 those that the Mayor was wanting
---
if
 it were not for this young fellow
---
that sometimes used
---
that people could fairly tell the
 breed
---
so that nobody would dream
---
the
 smallest four- legged beast had walked over it once
---
the care Mr. Henchard has!"
 
---
," said the other.


---
M'Leod of
 Ayr" was its name
---
It was soon over, and
---
You can stay and."
---
that had begun as a smile
---
Some other townsmen came up, and
---
" What's this,
 Henchard," said Alderman Tubber,."
---
You see, Mr. Henchard
---
"," said the lawyer, another goodnatured friend,
" where you made the mistake was in going so far afield.
---
You should have

---
But you did n't think of it and
---
, you see;
---
that's."


---
as if they were clear verbal inscriptions
---
when people deplored the fact, and
---
why it was,
---
The latter moved on into the dark dense old avenues, or rather
 vaults of living woodwork, which ran along the town boundary, and stood
 reflecting.


---
" And it's you, Miss Newson?--
---
imparted by the estrangement with the
 corn- merchant
---
there might be something wrong in this,
---
So together they went on, first down the West Walk, and

---
then into the Bowling Walk," It's."


---
But we'll not concern
 ourselves about it-- it is for the best.
---
you do!
---
It's the feeling for it rather than the learning of
 steps that makes pleasant dancers....
---
This seemed such a melancholy prospect that Elizabeth- Jane breathed
 a sigh--.

---
But darkness makes people truthful, and
---
the Scotchman went on
 impulsively
---
your stepfather had not been

---
But that's not for me!"


---
one of another they
 continued their promenade along the walls; twenty steps further and the trees would end,
 and the street- corner and lamps appear.
---
till they got near the bottom
 of the Bowling Walk
---
In consciousness of this they
 stopped.


---
who it was
---
that sent us to Durnover granary on a
 fool's errand that day
---
Did ye
 ever know yourself, Miss Newson?"


---
why they did it
---
" Perhaps it was not for fun.
---
It might have been?
---
that they thought
---
they
 would like us
---
you Casterbridge folk will not forget me
---
you would n't go
 at all
---
They had got into the lamplight.
---
They parted,
---
Elizabeth- Jane going up the street.
---
The letter began" Dear Sir," and
---
though nobody was there
---
It was quickly known in Casterbridge.
---
Surely not; and it must have been a passing impulse
.


---
The picture glassed back

---
such dreams are not for you
---
It was in
 the town- hall, after a council meeting,.
---
These tones showed
---
if we are not
---
,
 what are we?'
---
Od send,?
---
that we know our business as
 well as one here and there
---
While they had collectively profited by this quality of the
 corn- factor's
---
they had been made.
---
Seeing appeared alarmed.


---
All's well.
---
that ends well
---
" You promise?"


---
if you much wish it
---
therefore, you will not attempt
---
But such a scheme for buying
 over a rival had nothing to recommend it to the Mayor's headstrong
 faculties.
---
There was
---
The town was small, but
---
the corn and
 hay- trade was proportionately large, and.


---
which should seem like
 trade- antagonism to the Mayor
---
it's not.
---
In spite of this praiseworthy course the Scotchman's trade increased.

---
Whether it were
---
whether it was sheer luck
---
, the
 fact remained.
---
But most probably luck had little to do with it.
---
Character is Fate
---
, said
 Novalis, and
---
as Faust has been described
---
that it would be as well

---
Thus the incipient attachment was stifled down.


---
A time came
---
as their war of prices began

---
As soon everybody was interested, and
---
some few guessed the end.
---
It was, in some
 degree,
---
Almost every Saturday they encountered each other amid the crowd of
 farmers which thronged about the market- place in the weekly course of
 their business.
---
What-- are you, too, my
 enemy
---
as the box passenger foresees the approaching jerk from some channel
 across the highway
---
Bedtime came,
 and
---
they burnt a light all night.
---
who had been staying up
---
The writer said.
---
how impossible it would
 be for any further communications to proceed between them now
---
that you concealed nothing
 before our ill- advised acquaintance; and
---
They were

---
how inconsiderate my
 reproaches were
---
you will
---
which will
 make any future happiness possible for me
---
that the one condition is
---
that the past connection
 between our lives be kept secret outside this isle
---
you will not;
---
that no writings of mine, or trifling
 articles belonging to me, should be left in your possession through
 neglect or forgetfulness
---
any such you may have
---
Can you meet me with
 the letters and other trifles?
---
Poor thing-- better you had not known me!

---
that there could be no great harm in acquiescing thus far
---
The evening was chilly, and
---
the coach was late.
---
while the horses were being changed
---
that something had happened
---
which seemed to

---
To learn to take the universe seriously there is no quicker
 way than to watch-- to be a" waker,".

---
as the country- people call it
---
at which the last toss- pot went by and
---
till it seemed
---
that should release them from terrestrial
 constraint
---
what that chaos called consciousness,
---
as if waiting
 for the touch of some wand;, tended to, and.
---
You remember
---
the note sent to you and Mr. Farfrae
---
that you thought
---
it was a trick to

---
" Yes."

" It was not
---
to make fools of you-- it was done.

---
it could have been in
 my time
---
But there-- nothing is!
---
as you wish it
---
" Perhaps they'll be friends again
---
that the blinds were all down
---
At the town- pump there were gathered.
---
because it was purer from that original fount
 than from their own wells
---
," said Mrs. Cuxsom.
---
that wanted
---
my last
 breath's blowed
---
you'll find all my coffin clothes, a piece of
 flannel
---
-- that's, and
---
the little piece is; and
---
my new stockings for my feet-- they are folded alongside, and
 all my other things.
---
And there's four ounce pennies, the heaviest I
 could find, a- tied up in bits of linen, for weights-- two for my right
 eye and two for my left
---
when you've used'em, and
---
my
 eyes do n't open no more,.
---
do n't ye go

---
as you can
---
" Well, and Martha did it, and.

---
if ye'll believe words
---
Death's not of such good report that
 we should respect' en to that extent
---
To respect
 the dead is sound doxology; and
---
But money is scarce, and
---
throats get dry.
---
there was no treason in it
---
to hinder that or anything now,"
  answered Mother Cuxsom.
---
little things a' did n't wish,
---
anybody
 will see; and
---
It was three weeks
.


---
" Who do you put in your pictures of' em?"


---
that only one of them could possibly be recalled, and
---
" That you were related by marriage."


---
before you knew me
---
Then my task would not
 have been such a hard one....
---
Shame alone prevented your wretched parents from
 owning this to you while both of'em were alive."


---
when we were young
---
What you
 saw
---
was our second marriage.
---
We had thought
 each other dead-- and
---
it weeping
---
; why should you cry?
---
-- I'll be kinder to you
!
---
you to come to me all of a sudden
---
," said Henchard in
 jerks, and moving like a great tree in a wind.
---
when you like,
---
that chose your name, my daughter
---
" You'll take my surname now-- hey?

---
it will be much more pleasant to me.

---
' Tis legally yours, you know.
---
But nobody need
---
You shall take
 it as if by choice.
---
will you do this--
---
me put a few lines into the newspaper

---
that such is
---
If it is my name
---
" Well, well; usage is everything in these matters."


---
's have a light
---
It was done, and and

---
though tenderness softened it

---
this time--"I'll go upstairs and hunt for some documents that will
 prove it all to you.
---
what it all
 meant
---
were it emotive or
---
it choleric-- was almost a necessity.
---
which was folded
 and
---
The seal had cracked, and
---
the letter was open.

---
you will understand why
---
will; though perhaps you may not forgive me.
---
when you read this
---
Elizabeth- Jane will have a home.
---
here it is.
---
Elizabeth- Jane is not
 your Elizabeth- Jane-- the child who was in my arms when you sold me.

---
as you may judge
---
if you can,
---
you once deeply wronged
---
as if it were a window- pane through

---
that the blasting disclosure was
---
if it is true
---
They were fair
---
But this was an unimportant preliminary.

---
Misery taught him nothing more than defiant endurance of it.
---
that the concatenation of events this evening had produced
---
Yet they
 had developed naturally.
---
The mockery was,.


---
infernal harpies had snatched up the food.
---
These precincts embodied the mournful phases of Casterbridge life,.
---
as
 the south avenues embodied its cheerful moods
---
The whole way along here
 was sunless, even in summer time
---
; in spring, white frosts lingered here
;.
---
when other places were steaming with warmth
---
while in winter it was the
 seed- field of all the aches, rheumatisms, and torturing cramps of
 the year
---
The Casterbridge doctors must have pined away for want of
 sufficient nourishment but for the configuration of the landscape on the
 north- eastern side.


---
The river-- slow, noiseless, and dark-- the Schwarzwasser of
 Casterbridge-- ran beneath a low cliff,.
---
the two together forming a
 defence which had rendered walls and artificial earthworks on this side
 unnecessary
---
Here were ruins of a Franciscan priory, and
---
a mill attached
 to the same
---
, the water of which roared down a back- hatch like the voice
 of desolation.
---
Above the cliff, and behind the river, rose a pile of
 buildings, and in the front of the pile a square mass cut into the sky.

---
It was like a pedestal lacking its statue.
---
which the design remained incomplete
---
In the meadow the mob were
---
whenever an execution
 took place
---
they stood
---
which darkness imparted to the glooms of this region

---
Why the deuce did I come here
---
before that calling was monopolized over all England by a
 single gentleman; and
---
climbed up by a steep back lane into the town
---
half fainted,
---
, Elizabeth- Jane seeming
---
The morning came after this night of unrest, and with it the necessity
 for a plan.
---
especially as it would involve humiliation
---
that everything must be
---
as you say
---
that you are
---
It is so plain to me now.
---
Indeed, father, it is.
---
For, of course, you
 would not have done half the things you have done for me, and!
---
me
 have my own way so entirely
---
Now, father, breakfast is ready!"
---
The moment and the act prefigured for weeks with a thrill of pleasure
---
that it had come
---
the fruition of the
 whole scheme was such dust and ashes as this.




20.



---
The coldness soon broke out into open chiding.
---
It was dinner- time
---
-- they never met except at meals-- and."

"' Bide where you be,?"


---
If
 you'll bide
---
where you be a minute, father
---
Good God, are you only fit to

---
that ye use such words as those
---
in time it came to
."


---
that they" walked together
---
These improvements, however, are somewhat in advance of the story.

---
" Be jowned, and," said the gentleman.


---
" Now then--'An agreement entered into this sixteenth day of
 October'--write that first."


---
that would have

---
But other ideas
 reigned then:
---
that bristling characters were as innate
 and inseparable a part of refined womanhood as sex itself
---
Elizabeth- Jane produced a line of chain- shot and sand- bags
---
it
 must be admitted,
---
Phoebe come up twice
---
when the cat overturned the coal- scuttle
---
, why dostn't leave off
---
These domestic exhibitions were the small protruding needlerocks which
 suggested rather than revealed what was underneath.
---
But the most terrible ordeal was.
---
who worked in the yard wimbling
 hay- bonds
---
as there was
 no clear spot on which to deposit the provisions
---
" Why do you lower yourself so confoundedly?
---
' ee know
---
she've waited on worse
---
" It is not true!"
---
whose complexion, now pink and white
 from confinement, lost nearly all of the former colour
---
does this

---
It is true
---
"," said Elizabeth- Jane.
---
But it was"


---
" only--" Did you do it, or?
---
did n't you
---
Where was it?"


---
when we were
 staying there
---
that
 must have been caused by such a fact,
---
it shall be by no
 fault of my own
---
because it seemed
---
Winter had almost come, and unsettled weather.
---
But there were certain early winter
 days in Casterbridge-- days of firmamental exhaustion which followed
 angry south- westerly tempests-- when, if the sun shone, the air was like
 velvet.
---
Business had long since passed down them into its daily cells, and

---
Leisure had not arrived there.
---
So Elizabeth- Jane walked and.


---
as Elizabeth- Jane was
---
where the lady had come from
---
which mostly prevailed there
---
The stumpy and practical walk of
 honest homeliness, the two styles of dress
 thereabout, the simple and the mistaken, equally avouched.


---
; beside it were two footprints distinct in the soil, signifying
.
---
that the lady had stood there a long time
---
as things had been out of doors,
---
Interesting at home it turned out to
.
---
whose two years' mayoralty was ending
---
though Mrs. Stannidge seemed
---
" Well, where have you been?"
---
have you talk like that
---
One would think!
---
you worked upon a farm
---
that you lend
 a hand in public- houses
---
you talk like a clodhopper
---
if it goes on
---
burned,, this house ca n't hold us two."


---
them to go on
---
it means
 peace, and a marriage portion--
---
that the business be not carried on in my house.--

 Yours,

 M. HENCHARD
---
The morrow, being fairly fine, found Elizabeth- Jane again in the
 churchyard, but.
---
quite broken in spirit sat down on a bench.

---
where people
 sometimes walked instead of on the gravel
---
The bench seemed
---
to be
 touched by something
---
Elizabeth- Jane looked for a moment,,."
---
," said the lady, in a vivacious voice,.
---
" What can
 have happened?"


---
There was no movement or word for a few seconds
---
how it is with you
---
," said the latter.
---
whether there should be confidence
---
The lady's
 manner was so desirous, so anxious,.
---
," said Elizabeth- Jane.


---
" Perhaps you were
---
to blame," suggested the stranger.


---
when the servants ought
---
The lady seemed."
---
Do you know the
 impression your words give me?
---
But it has been very
 much.
---
while it has lasted
---
All is owing to my defects
---
my defects are owing to my history.
---
" What is your history?"


---
My history is not gay or attractive
---
if you really want
---
it was not.


---
" Perhaps it will be better soon
---
Now what do you think of this
---
; would you
 mind coming to me?
---
And a companion to you must be that."


---
And,
 of course, you want some one who can write that?"


---
" But where do you live?"


---
while my house
 was getting ready
---
The house is that one they call
 High- Place Hall-- the old stone one looking down the lane to the market.

---
Two or three rooms are fit for occupation,.
---
Now will you think over my proposal, and

---
if you are still in
 the same mind
---
the two parted at the gate
 of the churchyard.




21.



---
As a maxim glibly repeated from childhood remains
---
till some mature experience enforces it, so did this High- Place Hall now

---
High- Place Hall
 was undergoing repair
---
; a lady was coming there
---
to live shortly; all the
 shop- people knew it, and.


---
The lady had arrived that day.


---
When the lamps were lighted, and
---
it was yet not so dark
---
The Hall, with its grey facade and parapet, was the only residence of
 its sort so near the centre of the town.
---
It had, in the first place, the
 characteristics of a country mansion-- birds' nests in its chimneys,
 damp nooks where fungi grew and irregularities of surface direct from
 Nature's trowel.
---
At night the forms of passengers were patterned by the
 lamps in black shadows upon the pale walls.


---
This evening motes of straw lay around, and
---
other signs of the premises
 having been in that lawless condition.
---
which accompanies the entry of a
 new tenant
---
The house was entirely of stone, and.
---
It was not altogether aristocratic, still
 less consequential, yet
---
the old- fashioned stranger instinctively said
.


---
" Blood built it, and
---
Yet as regards the enjoying it the stranger would have been wrong, for
 until this very evening.
---
when the new lady had arrived
---
,, the house had
 been empty for a year or two while before that interval its occupancy
 had been irregular
---
The reason of its unpopularity was soon made
 manifest.
---
Some of its rooms overlooked the market- place; and
---
such a
 prospect from such a house was not considered desirable or seemly by its
 would- be occupiers.


---
The lady
 had obviously arrived.
---
Though for that matter
 the architecture deserved admiration, or at least study, on its own
 account.
---
It was Palladian, and
---
like most architecture erected since
.
---
the Gothic age was a compilation rather than a design
---
But its
 reasonableness made it impressive.
---
It was not rich, but rich enough.
---
A
 timely consciousness of the ultimate vanity of human architecture, no
 less than of other human things, had prevented artistic superfluity.


---
that it was arched and
 old--
---
The door was studded, and
---
the
 keystone of the arch was a mask.
---
Originally the mask had exhibited a
 comic leer,; but
---
generations of Casterbridge
 boys had thrown stones at the mask,; and
---
the
 blows thereon had chipped off the lips and jaws as if they had been
 eaten away by disease.
---
The position of the queer old door and the odd presence of the leering
 mask suggested one thing above all others as appertaining to the
 mansion's past history-- intrigue.
---
By the alley it had been possible to
-- the old play- house,
 the old bull- stake, the old cock- pit, the pool wherein nameless
 infants had been used to disappear.
---
High- Place Hall could boast of its
 conveniences undoubtedly.


---
which was
 down the alley
---
There being no other way out
---
Much might have resulted
 from recognition-- at the least a query on either side in one and the
 selfsame form
---
that
 it had changed
---
Absolute indifference had taken the place
 of irritability; and
---
Where are you going?"


---
if you ca n't get cultivated

---
where you are
---
" You do n't object?"


---
But you wo n't
 have enough money for this lively scheme without help,
---
you know
---
If you
 like I should be willing to make you an allowance,."


---
so that you not be
 bound to live upon the starvation wages refined folk are likely to pay
' ee
---
It had better be done properly
---
" A small
 annuity is---- and
---
you to have
---
The day and the hour came; but
---
a drizzling rain fell.
---
their mildewed leathers blacked
---
if the lady were not
 there
---
One side of the churchyard-- the side towards the weather-- was sheltered
 by an ancient thatched mud wall whose eaves overhung as much as one or
 two feet.
---
The young lady had come.


---
Fancies find rooms in the strongest
 minds.
---
" have you decided?"


---
as you like
---
you might not venture up here in the wind
---
I had a good mind to send to you to come to
 my house,. But as I
 like getting out of doors, I thought I would come and."

" It was my own thought."


---
" That shows.
---
we shall agree
---
Then can you come to- day?
---
My house is so
 hollow and dismal that I want some living thing there."


---
Voices were borne over to them at that instant on the wind and.
---
There came such words as" sacks,"
 " quarters,"" threshing,"" tailing,"" next Saturday's market.
---
," each
 sentence being disorganized by the gusts like a face in a cracked
 mirror
---
" Who are those?" said the lady.


---
The lady seemed.
---
where you were going to
---
" O-- how was that?"


---
" Perhaps you are right....
---
It is
 Miss Templeman....
---
Are they gone-- on the other side?
---
They have only gone up into the granary.
---
There is no other that I have
 noticed."


---
Elizabeth- Jane had been thinking of the door in the alley.


---
as you have not mentioned your destination
---
" Perhaps,, you may as well
 keep silent upon it.
---
till you are clear off
---
Who knows but
---
When they had emerged upon the open road and
---
parted, they found enough
.
---
Nevertheless the
 lady looked in at the corn- yard gates, and.
---
But nothing was visible there, and

---
the granary rising against
 the church- tower behind, where the smacking of the rope against the
 flag- staff still went on.


---
" But you said?"
---
you meant next month, or next year
---
Od,
 seize it-- you take time by the forelock!
---
This, then, is?"


---
how you be going

---
how can you speak like that?
---
I might go, father But I thought.' It is unjust of you!"
---
' ee go away from me.
---
It may be-- but
---
if you'll stop, and
---
But the proposal had come ten minutes too late.
---
if you want me badly
---
You are not going far
---
", you say.
---
What will be your address, in case
---
It is only in the town-- High- Place Hall!"


---
We go back for a moment to the preceding night,.


---
Don't be surprised.
---
It is for your good and mine,
,.
---
That depends upon another; and
---
, it was brought home to me very
 forcibly by my conscience
---
which my etourderie flung over my name
---
you are of the same mind
---
that you
 will take steps to this end.
---
how you were

---
what had happened since our separation
---
You probably feel.
---
My plans were altered
 by a family event, which it will surprise you to hear of.



---
that High- Place Hall was being prepared for
 a tenant
---
Who is coming
---
It was by no means with the oppression that would once have accompanied

---
the thought; it was, indeed,
 with interest, if not warmth.
---
if Miss Le
 Sueur was living there
---
that Miss Templeman only had come
---
as had been shown by the torrent of letters after the
 fiasco in their marriage arrangements, and
---
when another note came to the Mayor's house from High- Place Hall
---
though getting here has

---
You probably know?
---
you used
---
that at least you may be put to no trouble

---
if you wish
---
My first intention was; but
---
till you should meet me in the street
---
" You probably are aware of my arrangement with your daughter, and
---
my getting
---
Do you see, Michael,?--
---
You may have done
 so in your haste, but not deliberately, I am sure.
---
As the result has
 been
---
It was between eight and nine
 o'clock.
---
that Miss
 Templeman was engaged for that evening
---
" That's rather like giving herself airs!"
---
as if it were a
 clue line
---
The room disclosed was prettily furnished as a boudoir or small
 drawing- room, and
---
Why, you are late
---
" There were so many little things to put up."


---
" And you seem dead- alive and tired.
---
me try
---
" Well, have you chosen?"
---
how strange it is."


---
Miss Templeman looked at Elizabeth- Jane with interest, and."
---
while you sit by me
---
we'll talk."


---
It could be seen
---
if you have suspected
 it
---
you should know

---
whose large lustrous eyes had such
 an odd effect upside down
---
You
 speak French and Italian fluently
---
It is rather the other way."


---
" Where is your native isle?"


---
It was with rather more reluctance that Miss Templeman said," Jersey.

---
There they speak French on one side of the street and English on the
 other, and a mixed tongue in the middle of the road.
---
But it is a long
 time.
---
Bath is,.
---
where my people really belong to
---
though
 my ancestors in Jersey were as good as anybody in England
---
They were
 the Le Sueurs, an old family who have done great things in their time.

---
a deliberately formed resolve had been broken.


---
It could not, however, have been broken in safer company.
---
The farmers as a rule preferred the open carrefour for their
 transactions, despite its inconvenient jostlings and the danger from
 crossing vehicles, to the gloomy sheltered market- room provided for
 them.
---
Here they surged on this one day of the week,; men of extensive stomachs,
 sloping like mountain sides; men whose heads in walking swayed as the
 trees in November gales; who in conversing varied their attitudes much,
 lowering themselves by spreading their knees, and thrusting their hands
 into the pockets of remote inner jackets.
---
Their faces radiated tropical
 warmth
---
when at home their countenances varied with the
 seasons
---
; for though, their market- faces all the year round were glowing little
 fires.


---
All over- clothes here were worn
---
as if they were an inconvenience
---
the majority were
 careless in that respect,.
---
which were historical
 records of their wearer's deeds
---
Yet many carried ruffled cheque- books in their pockets
 which regulated at the bank hard by a balance of never less than four
 figures.
---
what these gibbous human shapes specially represented

---
It happened.

---
all two or
 three tall apple- trees standing
---
as if they grew on the spot
---
till it was
 perceived
---
who had often observed them
---
Elizabeth- Jane,, said,"?"


---
if the same
 trees come every week
---
whose
 face seemed
---
Elizabeth- Jane sighed.


---
" Are you particularly interested in anybody out there?
---
" O yes," said Elizabeth- Jane.


---
They are all farmers
---
There's Mr. Bulge--
---
; there's Benjamin
 Brownlet-- a horse dealer; and Kitson, the pig breeder; and Yopper, the
 auctioneer; besides maltsters, and millers-- and so on."
---
The Saturday afternoon slipped on thus desultorily.
---
The market changed
 from the sample- showing hour to the idle hour before starting homewards,
.
---
when tales were told
---
The days came but not the visitor,.
---
It may at once be declared

---
, the then
 unfortunate issue of things had chilled pure love considerably.
---
why their marriage should take place
---
why it should be postponed,
---
Tuesday was the great Candlemas fair.
---
" You have quarreled more deeply than I know of."


---
where you are
---
" O, my dear Miss Templeman-- what's the matter?
---
, Elizabeth- Jane would have a disagreeable
 necessity.


---
A provisional resource suggested itself."
---
Miss Henchard-- will you go on
 an errand for me as soon as breakfast is over?--
---
Ah, that's very good of
 you.
---
Will you go and
---
" And have you ever seen the Museum?"


---
Elizabeth- Jane had not.


---
" Then you should do so at once.
---
You can finish the morning by going
 there.
---
It is an old house in a back street--
---
you'll
 find out-- and
---
there are crowds of interesting things-- skeletons, teeth,
 old pots and pans, ancient boots and shoes, birds' eggs-- all charmingly
 instructive.
---
You'll be sure to stay till you get quite hungry."


---
as it was
---
The contents were briefly:--


 DEAR MICHAEL,--
---
You will be standing in view of my house to- day for two
 or three hours in the course of your business
---
Your
 daughter's presence here may be the cause of your neglect; and
---
you come on business
---
When the messenger returned
---
it was necessary; and
---
This was the best position after
 all, and
---
In spite of the waning of
 passion the situation was an agitating one
---
some other person had, indeed
---
it was just too late to recede.


---
The visitor, on the contrary, did not laugh half a wrinkle.


---
they showed me up here, and
---
" But is it?"
---
You must come and
---
you are here
---
Now this was not strictly true; but
---
there was no danger in it

---
though there was
---
" The fair to- day seems a large one
---
when, by natural
 deviation, their eyes sought the busy scene without
---
Your numerous
 fairs and markets keep me interested.
---
as they sat
---
the babble without reached them
-- voices as of wavelets on a looping sea, one ever and anon
 rising above the rest."
---
Do you look out often?
---
"

" Do you look for any one you know?"


---
You are always there
---
, are
 you not?
---
But it is amusing to look for
 somebody one knows in a crowd,.
---
It takes
 off the terrible oppressiveness of being surrounded by a throng, and
."


---
Maybe you'll be very lonely, ma'am?"


---
" Nobody knows how lonely."


---
" But you are rich
---
, they say?
---
" Where did ye come from, ma'am?"


---
" It's better,
 and
---
that's true; but
---
It is a
 great pity, but
---
it's always so!
---
when wheat
 was down
---
then afterwards when it rose a little I sold off all

---
It brought only a small profit to me;.
---
while the farmers kept
 theirs,
---
though the rats were gnawing the
 ricks hollow
---
went lower, and
---
when it happened
---
You are most interesting."


---
We common people are all one way or the other-- warm
 or cold, passionate or frigid.
---
You have."


---
both temperatures going on in
 you at the same time
---
" But how do you mean that?
---
Ye were best."


---
You are animated
---
"-- then you are thinking of getting on.
---
You are sad the
 next moment
---
-- then you are thinking of Scotland and friends."


---
But it was an old house where I was born, and

---
they pulled it down for improvements, so
---
that the house was in St.
 Helier, and not in Bath
---
" But the mountains, and the mists and the rocks, they are there!
---
And
 do n't they seem like home?"


---
They do to me
---
-- they do to me
---
Whether its origin were national or personal
---
, it
 was quite true.
---
Like the colours in a variegated cord those contrasts
 could be seen
---
You are wishing
---
you were back again
---
The fair without the windows was now raging thick and loud.
---
It was, and.
---
In substance it was a whitey- brown crowd flecked with
 white--.
---
this being the body of labourers waiting for places
---
so bowed by hard work and years
---
A little way off negotiations were proceeding; but
---
there seemed.


---
In these there was a difficulty.
---
The farmer would not take
 the crust without the crumb of the bargain,.


---
who stood by,
---
you see
---
It was, indeed, a hopeless length
 of traction for Dan Cupid's magnet;
---
The farmer
 said.


---
It is very hard
---
Lovers ought not to

---
people live and at their pleasure
---
that they'll not be parted
---
"" O, you are so good!"
---
me know
---
if you have succeeded
---
The eyes of
 all brightened; the bargain was soon struck.
---
immediately it was concluded.


---
It is kind- hearted of you, indeed
---
that all my servants shall have lovers
---
if they want them
---
that's true
---
you are
---
as you say
---
Two farmers met and
---
their
 remarks could be heard.


---
as others' had been
---
" Now you must go
---
must you not
---
You had better go
---
" You will lose a customer.


---
" Now, Miss Templeman, you will make me angry,
---
you do n't go
---
" Business ought,
---
not to be neglected ought it?"


---
" It's true.
---
What has happened to us to- day
---
" is very curious."


---
when we are alone
---
" Something to think over, it's like to be?"


---
It is commonplace after all."


---
whatever it has been
---
" Well,, it is now over; and
---
the market calls you to
."


---
there were no business in the
 warrld
---
" How you change!"
---
" You should not change like this.


---
" It is only since
 coming here and seeing you!"


---
If that's the case
---
", you had better not look at me any longer.
---
" You may hear
---
them speak of me in
 Casterbridge
---
as time goes on
---
If they tell you."


---
Why was
 this?
---
They could not have told.


---
which it could fly and
---
long as it was warm
---
Three minutes later,, knocks, not
 of multitude but of strength, sounded through the house, and
---
The message was taken down, and
---
You'll live with me a long time
---
, wo n't you?"


---
Yet
 it was not.
---
which it afforded
---
The carrefour was like the regulation Open Place in spectacular
 dramas, where the incidents that occur always happen to bear on the
 lives of the adjoining residents.
---
Farmers, merchants, dairymen, quacks,
 hawkers, appeared there from week to week, and.
---
as the
 afternoon wasted away
---
It was the node of all orbits.


---
In an emotional sense they did not live at all during the
 intervals.
---
Wherever they might go, on market- day

---
wandering on other days they were sure to be at home.
---
Both stole
---
they seldom saw
---
Thus things went on,.
---
till a certain market- morning brought a new
 sensation
---
when a parcel
 containing two dresses arrived for the latter from London
---
that would suit best.


---
But settling upon new clothes is
---
You are
 that person"
---
"( pointing to one of the arrangements)," or you are THAT
 totally different person"(."


---
for the whole of the
 coming spring and one of the two, you do n't know
---
which, may turn out to

---
pointing to the other)," be very objectionable
---
It was finally decided by Miss Templeman.
---
The dress was pronounced, and
---
The morning was exceptionally bright for the time of year.
---
Suddenly, after a rumbling
 of wheels, there were added to this steady light a fantastic series of
 circling irradiations upon the ceiling, and
---
the companions turned to the
 window.
---
Immediately opposite a vehicle of strange description had come
 to a standstill,.


---
as if it had been placed there for exhibition
---
It was the new- fashioned agricultural implement called a horse- drill,
 till then unknown, in its modern shape, in this part of the country,
.
---
where the venerable seed- lip was still used for sowing as in the days
 of the Heptarchy
---
Its arrival created about as much sensation in the
 corn- market as a flying machine
---
would create at Charing Cross.
---
The
 farmers crowded round it
---
, children crept under and
 into it.
---
The machine was painted in bright hues of green, yellow, and
 red, and
---
it resembled as a whole a compound of hornet, grasshopper,
 and shrimp,.
---
Or it might have been likened to an
 upright musical instrument with the front.
---
That was."
---
Why, it is a sort of agricultural piano
---
" It has something to do with corn
---
who thought of introducing it here
---
not
 a farmer closely leagued with farming operations
---
us go and
---
whatever it is
---
Elizabeth- Jane's bonnet and shawl were pitchforked on in a moment, and

---
they went out.
---
They examined it curiously;."
---
which tossed the seed into the upper ends of the tubes that conducted it
 to the ground
---
till somebody said,
---
Miss Templeman bowed.
---
" This is a
 curious machine."


---
" Who brought it here?
---
it should act
---
that the suit might be progressing
---
Then something seemed.
---
unless,
 indeed, they might have been spoken to one of the yellow- gaitered
 farmers near them
---
was dissipated by the humming of a song, which sounded
 as though from the interior of the machine
---
The hummed song went on--

     "
---
' Tw-- s on a s-- m-- r aftern-- n,
      A wee be-- re the s-- n w-- nt d-- n,
      When Kitty wi' a braw
---
Elizabeth- Jane had apprehended the singer in a moment, and.
---
We are looking at the wonderful new drill
---
"," Miss Templeman said.
---
" But
 practically it is a stupid thing--
---
is it not?
---
" It will revolutionize sowing
 heerabout!
---
No more sowers flinging their seed about broadcast, so that
 some falls by the wayside and some among thorns, and all that.

---
Each grain will go straight to its intended place, and nowhere else
 whatever!"


---
that observeth the wind
---
so the Preacher
 said; but
---
It must be so!"
---
But the machines are already very common in the
 East and North of England
---
the Scriptures being somewhat limited
---
" Is the machine yours?
---
that it should be got
---
The latter felt.
---
Together they saw the
 market thicken, and in course of time thin away with the slow decline
 of the sun towards the upper end of town, its rays taking the street
 endways and enfilading the long thoroughfare from top to bottom.
---
The
 gigs and vans disappeared one by one.
---
till there was not a vehicle in the
 street
---
The time of the riding world was over
---
; the pedestrian world held
 sway.
---
Field labourers and their wives and children trooped in from the
 villages for their weekly shopping, and instead of a rattle of wheels
 and a tramp of horses ruling the sound as earlier
---
, there was nothing but
 the shuffle of many feet.
---
All the implements were gone; all the farmers;
 all the moneyed class.
---
The character of the town's trading had changed
 from bulk to multiplicity and pence.


---
as pounds had been
 handled earlier in the day
---
for though it was night
---
and
 the street lamps were lighted
---
, they had kept their shutters.
---
In
 the faint blink of the fire they spoke more freely.


---
It is
---
than you can imagine
---
You
 do n't know."


---
what it is
---
you may feel a-- sense of disgrace-- shame-- in other ways."


---
" Have you ever had any such feeling?
---
" said the younger innocently.


---
what happens sometimes

---
" It must make them very unhappy afterwards."


---
" It makes them anxious;
---
Possibly they were destroyed; but
---
that they had never been written
---
A few days afterwards, the latter was going out
---
that Miss Templeman was
 nourishing a hope of seeing the attractive Scotchman
---
The fact was

---
as Elizabeth- Jane was beginning
---
that
 they could be held
---
how they probably parted with
 frigidity in their general contour and movements, only in the smaller
 features showing the spark of passion, thus invisible to all
---
This discerning silent witch had not done thinking of these
 things.


---
It was all true
---
" How did you know?"


---
" Ah," said Elizabeth- Jane.


---
" They were intimate-- rather.
---
But there was an unsuspected
 hitch in the proceedings
---
After that they were
 much apart
---
which separated them
---
Now comes the point
---
" A new man-- that's bad!"


---
who was swinging the town
 pump- handle
---
" It is bad!
---
Though you must remember."


---
"," said Elizabeth- Jane thoughtfully.
---
" It is so
 difficult.
---
It wants a Pope!"


---
" You prefer not to perhaps?"
---
as times go
---
That is my worst place
---
How many years more do you think?"


---
It may be five years
---
With no love you might calculate on ten."


---
in fact it was rather.
---
as if it were written on the top of the church- tower hard by
---
Elizabeth- Jane being absent
---
This caused.

---
does that

---
" What nonsense mean?
---
You know
---
what you lost by it in thinking too little of
 yourself and too much of me
---
that you can fix the day or month,
 with my full consent
---
to say, whenever in your opinion it would be seemly
---
to say to give you my name in return
 for your devotion and;: you
 know more of these things than I."


---
It is full early yet
---
it is
---
you know
---
what had happened between us
---
, that after it was my duty.
---
any unnecessary delay occur before putting things to rights
---
because-- well, you can guess
---
how this money
 you've come into
---
me feel
---
as this could be bought in
 Casterbridge
---
" Nor can it be
---
will it
---
Nor till fifty years more of
 civilization have passed over the town.
---
It took a waggon and four horses
."


---
It looks."


---
as if you were living on capital
---
But the fact is,."


---
your setting up like this makes
---
my
 beaming towards you rather awkward
---
An answer was not really needed, and
---
there's nobody in the world I would have wished to see enter
 into this wealth before you, Lucetta, and nobody
---
who will
 become it more
---
The stint of reciprocal feeling was perceived, and

---
" You may be obliged or not for't.
---
Though the things may not have
 the polish of what you've lately learnt to expect for the first time in
 your life
---
, they are real, my lady Lucetta."


---
" That's rather a rude way of speaking to me,".


---
you ought."


---
" How can you speak so!"
---
Knowing, you ought!
---
, surely the privilege is due to me!"


---
Yes, it is
---
" But it is not by what is, in this life, but by
 what appears, that you are judged; and I therefore think you ought to
 accept me-- for your own good name's sake.
---
What is known in your native
 Jersey
---
may get known here.
---
" How you keep on about Jersey!
---
Well, what do you say to my proposal?"


---
things be
---
there being no pressure of half acquaintance to drive them into
 speech if they were not minded for it
---
" That's the way the wind blows
---
, is it?"
---
A yellow flood of reflected sunlight filled the room for a few instants.

---
No, no; such is not for me
---
" You came
---
" Yet
 now you are here!"


---
you wo n't have anything to say to my offer
---
it would be
 madness
---
I'll love!"


---
no relatives left
---
The pain became at times half
.
---
; in danger they uttered a conventional
 word of sympathy at the news, and.

---
that it was
 quite natural
---
when the moon had risen in the skies
---
it had
---
Continually it had happened.
---
It chanced.
---
which ran along the south wall of the town
---
there was not another soul near.

---
They receded from each
 other several paces!"
---
" Do you remember
---
" Do you remember my telling' ee how it all began and how it ended?


---
" Well, ye owe her nothing more now
---
It is true
---
They were not
 those of a conscious rival.


---
There
 was an antagonistic force in exercise,.
---
That it was not
 innate caprice.
---
as if
 they screened an ousting presence
---
whose presence that
 was--
---
"," said kind Elizabeth- Jane,.


---
There was a knock at the door; literally, three full knocks and a little
 one at the end.


---
" That kind of knock means half- and- half
---
who at the
 first decent opportunity had come
---
just as any young fool of a lover might feel
---
They sat stiffly side by side at the darkening table, like some Tuscan
 painting of the two disciples supping at Emmaus.
---
who had
---
that there were long spaces of
 taciturnity,, the exchange of greetings among their neighbours, and the
 rattle of the yokes by which they carried off their evening supply.


---
when all exterior circumstances were subdued to the touch
 of spoons and china, the click of a heel on the pavement under the
 window, the passing of a wheelbarrow or cart, the whistling of the
 carter, the gush of water into householders' buckets at the town- pump
 opposite
---
each feeling
---
the slice came in two.


---
And the sense of occult rivalry in suitorship was
 so much superadded to the palpable rivalry of their business lives.
---
To
 the coarse materiality of that rivalry it added an inflaming soul.


---
," said the corn- factor.
---
" Are you in a
 place?"


---
" How much do you ask?"


---
" When can you come?"


---
when you used that way
---
Then the thing is settled.
---
The testimonials you
 showed me."


---
when you first tried for't
---
That characters deteriorated in time of need
---
" one
 thing is necessary to me, as the biggest corn- and- hay dealer in these
 parts
---
who's taking the town trade
---
D'ye hear?
---
We two ca n't live side by
 side--
---
that's clear and certain."


---
," said the new foreman.
---
They then entered into specific details of the process by which this
 would be accomplished, and.


---
Elizabeth- Jane heard by accident.
---
But it was done to no purpose.

---
The season's weather seemed.
---
The time was in
 the years immediately before foreign competition had revolutionized
 the trade in grain
---
; when still, as from the earliest ages, the wheat
 quotations from month to month depended entirely upon the home harvest.

---
A bad harvest, or the prospect of one, would double the price of corn in
 a few weeks; and
---
the promise of a good yield would lower it as rapidly.

---
Prices were like the roads of the period, steep in gradient, reflecting
 in their phases the local conditions, without engineering, levellings,
 or averages.


---
The people, too, who were
 not farmers, the rural multitude,.
---
than they do now
---
Indeed, the feeling of the
 peasantry in this matter was so intense.
---
Their impulse was well- nigh.


---
which came as the
 Alastor of those households whose crime it was to be poor
---
After midsummer they watched the weather- cocks.
---
Sun elated them
---
; quiet rain sobered them;
 weeks of watery tempest.
---
which
 they now regard as disagreeable they then beheld as maleficent
---
It was June, and
---
the weather was very unfavourable.
---
as it were the bell- board
---
on which all the adjacent hamlets and villages
 sounded their notes,
---
that had been rejected in the foregoing summer
---
time- stiffened water- tights reappeared
---
what so many have wished--
---
what
 was at present only strong probability
---
as such
 head- strong natures often are
---
what are
 called lonely villages
---
that were teeming by comparison
---
One evening such a shrouded figure on foot
 might have been perceived.
---
which dripped over the prophet's cot
---
The turnpike- road became a lane,
 the lane a cart- track, the cart- track a bridle- path, the bridle- path a
 foot- way, the foot- way overgrown.
---
The solitary walker slipped here and
 there, and.
---
formed by the brambles
---
The cottage, comparatively a large
 one, had been built of mud by the occupier's own hands, and.
---
here it was assumed.


---
," There's nothing in' em,"
  with full assurance on the surface of their faces
---
, very few of them were
 unbelievers in their secret hearts.
---
they
 did it" for a fancy."
---
they said," Just a trifle for
 Christmas," or" Candlemas," as the case might be.


---
when at church they professed so much and

---
a door
 was inserted as in a wall.
---
Outside the door the tall traveller stopped,
.
---
The window shutters were and
---
The
 visitor stepped back a little from the light, and.
---
The other's invitation to come in was

---
responded to by the country formula
---
," This will do,.
---
which the householder had no alternative but
---
that you can-- do things of a sort
---
Can I speak
 to' ee I've long heard?" Maybe so, Mr. Henchard," said the weather- caster.


---
" Ah-- why do you call me that?"
---
Because it's your name.
---
you'd come
---
you might be leery from your walk
---
Now, for instance, can ye charm away warts?"


---
if they will wear the toad- bag by
 night as well as by day
---
you can know at once."
---
( The fact
 was.)
---
that five farmers had already been there on the same errand from
 different parts of the country
---
" By the sun, moon, and stars, by the
 clouds, the winds, the trees, and grass, the candle- flame and swallows,
 the smell of the herbs; likewise by the cats' eyes, the ravens, the
 leeches, the spiders, and the dungmixen, the last fortnight in August
 will be-- rain and tempest."


---
" You are not certain, of course?"


---
As one can be in a world where all's unsure.'
---
Twill be more like living
 in Revelations this autumn than in England.
---
you don't--'tis quite understood,
---
" You have given me a crown.

---
because you've one too many
---
But wo n't you join me at supper,?"


---
now' tis waiting and all
---
But as sitting down to
 hob- and- nob there would have seemed
---
The weather changed
---
which had been like tin for weeks
---
; the
 sunlight,, assumed the hues of
 topaz.
---
The temperament of the welkin passed from the phlegmatic to
 the sanguine
---
; an excellent harvest was almost a certainty; and
---
as a
 consequence prices rushed down.


---
All these transformations, lovely to the outsider, to the wrong- headed
 corn- dealer were terrible.
---
Much of the corn never seen
---
; it had not even been moved from the ricks in which it lay
.
---
for since their exchange
 of words in the South Walk they had been on stiffly speaking terms
---
These
 things always happen,
---
do n't they?
---
it has been said
---
that figures
 have touched me tight lately
---
is that anything rare?
---
The case is not
 so bad as folk make out perhaps.
---
which might be a
 satire disguised
---
" You can wipe and wipe, and!"
---
can ye
---
If it had n't been for your blasted advice
---
" it might have been
 a fine day enough!
---
Why did ye let, hey?--!
---
me go on
---
when a word of doubt
 from you or anybody would have made
---
me think twice
---
" My advice, sir, was."


---
what you thought best
---
And the sooner you help somebody else in that way
---
It was the eve of harvest.
---
was buying.
---
after reckoning too surely on famine weather the local farmers
 had flown to the other extreme, and
---
There were three days of excellent weather, and then--"What if that
 curst conjuror should be right after all!"
---
The fact was,.
---
that no sooner had
---
the sickles begun
---
as if cress would grow in it without other
 nourishment
---
It rubbed people's cheeks like damp flannel.
---
when they
 walked abroad
---
There was a gusty, high, warm wind
---
; isolated raindrops
 starred the window- panes at remote distances
---
: the sunlight would flap
 out like a quickly opened fan,.


---
as it had appeared
---
From that day and hour it was clear.
---
that there was not
---
if it can
 be
---
that somebody has been roasting a waxen image of me, or
---
yet-- what
 if they should ha' been doing it!"
---
It was indeed hard.


---
that the
 speaker should, of all others, have
---
September- night shades had fallen upon Casterbridge
---
; the clocks had
 struck half- past eight, and
---
the moon had risen.
---
The streets of the town
 were curiously silent for such a comparatively early hour.
---
These were

---
The neighbouring Market House and Town Hall abutted against its next
 neighbour the Church except in the lower storey, where an arched
 thoroughfare gave admittance to a large square called Bull Stake.
---
A
 stone post rose in the midst, to which the oxen had formerly been tied
 for baiting with dogs to make them tender before they were killed in the
 adjoining shambles.
---
The thoroughfare leading to this spot was now blocked by two four- horse
 waggons and horses, one laden with hay- trusses,.
---
the leaders having
 already passed each other, and
---
The
 passage of the vehicles might have been practicable if empty; but
---
as one was
---
built
 up with hay to the bedroom windows, it was impossible.


---
" You must have done it a' purpose!"
---
" You can
 hear my horses' bells half- a- mile such a night as this!"


---
If ye'd been minding your business instead of
---
" zwailing along in such
 a gawk- hammer way, you would have zeed me!"
---
However, according to the strict rule of the road it appeared
---
In doing this the near hind- wheel rose against
 the churchyard wall and the whole mountainous load the legs of the thill horse.


---
that was down
---
they watched the bright heap of new hay lying in the
 moon's rays, and.
---
The other's is the empty
 waggon, and
---
," said Elizabeth- Jane."
---
And I can assure you."

" You ca n't trust THEIR senses!"
---
" Why, you see, sir,--!"


---
making crooked seem straight to
 their eyes
---
" But do you know?
---
who that lady is
---
you talk about in such a fashion
---
Do
 you know?
---
the door was shut.
---
While pausing the old constable came
 up.


---
that nobody drives against that hay and waggon to- night
---
" Just see,
 Stubberd," said the corn- merchant.
---
" It must bide till the morning,.
---
for
 all hands are in the field still
---
if any coach or road- waggon wants

---
they must go round by the back street, and
---
" Oh, what's that?"


---
That's all, sir."


---
the constable having strolled
 elsewhere, and
---
the horses being removed
---
Though the moon was not bright

---
as yet there were no lamps lighted, and
---
The lights disappeared,.
---
the clock
 struck nine, and
---
was
 certain,
---
They went together
 by the way of a back lane westward,;.


---
where they were going
---
The harvest had been so delayed by the capricious weather.
---
whenever
 a fine day occurred all sinews
---
what could be saved
 of the damaged crops
---
the
 harvesters worked by moonlight
---
formed by Casterbridge town
---
Hence to- night the wheat- fields abutting
 on the two sides of the square were animated
 by the gathering hands.
---
Nearly the whole town had gone into the fields.
---
The Casterbridge
 populace still retained the primitive habit of helping one another in
 time of need; and
---
though the corn belonged to the farming section
 of the little community--
---
thus, that inhabiting the Durnover quarter
---
-- the
 remainder was no less interested in the labour of getting it home.


---
" Very well, then I'll be there. The
" stitches" or shocks rose like tents about the yellow expanse, those in
 the distance becoming lost in the moonlit hazes.


---
two others had entered at that place, and
---
them winding among the shocks
---
A meeting promised, and
---
You have my leave
---
what you like
---
" you are sure to be much sought after for your position, wealth,
 talents, and beauty.
---
But will ye resist the temptation to be one of
 those ladies with lots of admirers-- ay-- and?"

" And
---
you'll never have any
---
if you lack them only for that

---
" Are you
 sure you wo n't be jealous
---
You are Donald
---
What special thing did you mean?
---
They went on towards
 the scene of activity, where the sheaves were being handed, a dozen a
 minute, upon the carts and waggons which carried them away.


---
when they drew near the
 workpeople
---
But the room was empty, and
---
followed by a
 soft closing of the door
---
" How can you frighten me so?"
---
" It
 is past ten o'clock, and"


---
you have no right to surprise me here at such a
 time.
---
Is
 it so necessary that I should stop to think of manners and customs?"


---
" It is too late for propriety, and."


---
you would not see me, and
---
you were
 in when I called now
---
It is you, Lucetta, who are doing wrong.
---
It is
 not proper in' ee.
---
you seem
---
" But you ought
---
" It came to nothing; and through you.
---
that you proposed
---
that
 you had planned it out of mere charity-- almost as an unpleasant
 duty--
---
you thought

---
you must repay me
---
" Why did you come here, then?"


---
since you were
 free
---
" And why then do n't you think so now?"


---
It was only too obvious.
---
that conscience had ruled well
 enough
---
till new love had intervened and
---
The only thing was,", so
---
now my circumstances have altered
---
" That's true.
---
And it makes the case awkward for me.
---
Besides, that argument has nothing in
 it.
---
you are thinking of
---
unless you give me your promise this very night
---
But the
 supplanter was the upstart(, and
---
you to hear this
---
will you not, marry me?


---
If you-- wish it
---
" You say yes?"


---
" Do n't be a no'thern simpleton!" said Henchard drily.
---
", wo n't it?"


---
Who are you talking about?
---
Then it is my mistake
---
But the business is
 between me and Miss Templeman.
---
Elizabeth- Jane continued.
---
" What is this?"
---
And how is it

---
that you promise
---
Ah-- you have many many secrets from me!"


---
" Perhaps you have some from me
---
it all be
---
To- day Dr. Chalkfield, the Mayor for
 the year, being absent, the corn- merchant took the big chair,.


---
There was one case only, and
---
quickly as it had come
---
said the other magistrate.


---
's hear
---
what you've got to

---
Stubberd was sworn in
---
the constable began--

" Hearing a' illegal noise
---
" Do n't go so fast, Stubberd," said the clerk.


---
Stubberd continued:" When I had
 proceeded to the spot I saw defendant at another spot, namely, the
 gutter."
---
Stubberd pulled up
 again
---
The magistrates consulted, and
---
the second one said.


---
that the bench was
 of opinion
---
you son of a bee, dee me,
---
what is said out of my hearing

---
is not evidence."


---
There was another stoppage for consultation
---
, a book was referred to, and

---
finally Stubberd was allowed.
---
The truth was.
---
that they were obliged
---
when Stubberd had rambled on a little further

---
" Come-- we do n't want
---
, that's beginning at the beginning
---
you go back to the Creation
---
said the clerk, not without satire.


---
what was evidence and
---
what was
 not
---
" They sat down and.
---
who asked for't
---
A sailor came in and, and.
---
in tint as if
 it had been powdered over with ashes.
---
We do n't want
---
" to hear your life
 and adventures," said the second magistrate sharply,.
---
which followed
---
" You've been asked."


---
if you've anything to say bearing on
 the case
---
" That bears on the case.
---
It proves, and."


---
"' Tis a concocted story," said the clerk.
---
And upon my soul it does prove!
---
The sensation in the court was indescribably great.
---
that was much larger than usual
---
came out, passing through a group of people on the steps
 and outside; for it seemed.
---
This had brought them hither.


---
" Why are there so many idlers round the Town Hall to- day?"
---
to go away from home to the
 seaside for a few days-- to Port- Bredy; Casterbridge was so gloomy.


---
which only served
---
if anything should be called curious in
 concatenations of phenomena wherein each is known to have its accounting
 cause
---
It was the day of the chief market-- Saturday-- and Farfrae
.

---
Nevertheless, it was known.


---
that night--"for
 Sunday," as Casterbridge expressed it
---
This end marked a mile; and
---
The spot was a vale between two gentle acclivities, and the road,

---
There was
 neither hedge nor tree in the prospect now,.
---
the road clinging to the
 stubby expanse of corn- land like a strip to an undulating garment
---
nothing appeared
 thereon-- not so much as a speck.
---
Here the case was different.
---
A single figure was approaching
 her--
---
where
 breeding was carried on with Abrahamic success
---
to be sold by the local
 auctioneer
---
In the main the animals would have walked along quietly enough; but
---
the
 Casterbridge tradition was.
---
that to drive stock it was indispensable
---
that
 hideous cries, coupled with Yahoo antics and gestures, should be used,

---
large sticks flourished, stray dogs called in, and in general everything
 done
---
that was likely to infuriate the viciously disposed and terrify the
 mild
---
It was a large specimen of the breed, in colour
 rich dun,.
---
It was not
---
till they observed this dangling stick
---
really alarmed; for it revealed to them.


---
that the bull was an old
 one, too savage to be driven, which had in some way escaped, the staff

---
They looked round for some shelter or hiding- place, and thought of the
 barn hard by.
---
no sooner did they
 turn their backs.
---
This caused
---
, whereupon the bull advanced in a deliberate charge.


---
The barn stood behind a green slimy pond, and
---
it was save as to
 one of the usual pair of doors facing them, which had been propped open
 by a hurdle- stick, and for this opening they made.
---
The interior had been
 cleared by a recent bout of threshing except at one end, where there was
 a stack of dry clover.
---
Elizabeth- Jane took in the situation.
---
We must
 climb up there
---
before they had even approached it
---
But they heard
---
all three were imprisoned in the barn together.
---
The mistaken
 creature saw them, and.
---
into which
 they had fled
---
they had crossed over
---
What
 might have happened
---
had; but

---
their situation continued
---
in a few moments a rattling of the door distracted their adversary's
 attention, and
---
The wrench was in reality so violent that the thick neck seemed to have
, blood.
---
whilst the nose dropped

---
The premeditated human contrivance of the nose- ring was too
 cunning for impulsive brute force, and
---
the creature flinched.


---
" You-- have saved me!"
---
" You once saved
 me."


---
" How-- comes it-- you?"
---
you have been away, and
---
Perhaps you can not talk now?"


---
without waiting for
 the ladder to be placed.


---
They had reached the top
 and.


---
"," said Elizabeth- Jane.
---
the others pursuing their way
---
what had occurred
---
Elizabeth- Jane mentioning
---
, you say?
---
They are almost there by this time."


---
Elizabeth- Jane was quite sure.


---
that
 it would be best
---
soon the two
 figures of the others were visible at the entrance to the town.
---
When these reached
---
These phenomena, however, seemed.
---
When will everything be sent up?
---
" You see, or
---
we was n't aware
 till this morning
---
that you were going
---
we could have been
 forwarder."


---
Eight o'clock
 will do well enough.
---
if it be not later
---
Now, do n't ye be standing here
, or
---
it will be twelve."
---
You said to me,'.'
---
That
 cut me deep.
---
that there was some truth in it
---
to marry me just now would do that as nothing
 else.
---
could-- it is but too plain
---
"-- you have saved my life.
---
And your care of me is
 like coals of fire on my head!
---
you might do
---
what kind is it
---
You may have heard?
---
That's just put me in a strait.


---
" And you would wish?"


---
me to advance some money
---
what you can do
---
No, Lucetta;
 is this and
---
it would save me.
---
that you would let.--
---
it be
--
---
that you are my intended
---
that we are
---
Now stop, you have n't heard all!
---
Nobody else need
---
as if we were on such terms
---
all is postponed between us for a year
 or two
---
Not a soul in the town need know.
---
how you've helped me
---
Since you
 wish
---
to be of use, there's your way."


---
what the people called the" pinking in" of the day
---
If it were anything else
---
" But it is such a little thing!"
---
than you have offered
---
what you have
---
" It is not
---
-- it is
---
" You are provoking!"
---
" It is enough to make me force you to
 carry out at once what you have promised."


---
's hear
---
what you mean
---
We were
 married this week at Port- Bredy.
---
There were reasons against our doing it
 here.
---
";" don't-- don't be cruel!
---
that grieved me
---
; it would have been
 letting myself down.
---
as long as
 there was a chance of keeping me for yourself by doing so
---
But you will
 not do so now,?
---
will you, Michael
---
for it is too late."


---
The notes of St. Peter's bells in full peal had been wafted to them
, and now the genial thumping of the town band, renowned
 for its unstinted use of the drum- stick, throbbed down the street.


---
they are making
---
" Then this racket is on account of it,
---
" You promised me!"


---
But it was under compulsion, and
---
how you courted me
---
" You do n't deserve pity!
---
You did; but
---
you do n't now."


---
as the band came round
 the corner,
---
The work
 was not heavy, but
---
Nobody there as yet
 knew; and
---
what had happened
---
" There is one thing I have not done; and
---
yet it is important
---
" Ah, and you have not?
---
And, Donald, you do n't mind?
---
" It is I."


---
who have
 come to your house, not you to mine
---
if you had quite recovered from your fright
---
you had a visitor
---
What are the bells ringing for
---
And the
 band, too, is playing.
---
Somebody must be married; or
---
else they are
 practising for Christmas."


---
" What a lonely creature you are.
---
what's going on
---
what people are
 talking about everywhere with keen interest
---
then you would n't be obliged.
---
Elizabeth- Jane said and.


---
" But you said
---
You will never breathe this,
---
if you say not
---
that the case is more complicated
---
-- worse, in
 fact-- than it seemed in my story.
---
that we ought,
---
as the
 world had talked of us
---
we parted.
---
Now we'll complete our purposes
---
" Have you not lately renewed your promise?
---
" said the younger with quiet
 surmise.
---
" That was wrung from me by a threat."


---
" Yes, it was.
---
And it was not
 till after my renewed promise that I knew it."


---
" Then there is only one course left to honesty.
---
Any suspicion of impropriety was to Elizabeth- Jane like a red rag to
 a bull.
---
" I am certain," I have guessed very
 well. My father; and I say."

 You ought!"
---
" I do n't admit that!"" Admit it or not, it is true!"


---
" When did you do it?
---
Why did you
 not tell me, instead of teasing me like this?
---
, it seems, in a moment of
 intoxication
---
And it is true.
---
we shall all three
!"


---
what might
---
cried Elizabeth- Jane, in Nathan tones


---
" The bells are ringing on that account
---
till a more suitable house is ready for
 us
---
you to stay with me just as before
---
me think of it alone
---
" You shall.
---
It was still early in the evening
---
would keep body and soul
 together.
---
which were pursued unremittingly
---
that had taken place
---
By this time the marriage was known throughout
 Casterbridge
---
before the magistrates had spread
---
The amends after
 life were lost sight of in the dramatic glare of the original act.
---
the incident been, it might by this time

---
But the act having lain as dead and,
---
the
 interspace of years was unperceived; and
---
Small as the police- court incident had been in itself
---
, it formed the
 edge or.
---
It was strange.
---
which is the soul of commerce in grain
---
The produce if
 honestly offered would have created no scandal; but
---
One day
 Elizabeth- Jane was passing the King's Arms,.
---
people bustling
 in and out more than usual
---
where there was no market
---
in which debtor and creditors had assembled
---
The room was a front
 one, and
---
the creditors were leaving.
---
; the black hair and
 whiskers were the same as ever, but
---
a film of ash was over the rest.


---
that we've been talking
 about
---
that appear on the balance- sheet
---
" Gentlemen over and above the assets, and, there be these.
---
It all
 belongs to ye, as much as everything else I've got, and
---
There, now you have all I've got in the world
---
" We do n't want that.'
---
What do you say, neighbours--
---
do ye agree?"


---
we do n't wish it at all
---
the rest responded
 unanimously.


---
" Well," said the senior Commissioner,,".
---
though the
 case is a desperate one
---
the balance- sheet to be as
 honestly made out as it could possibly be
---
; we have had no trouble
---
; there
 have been no evasions and no concealments.
---
which
 led to this unhappy situation
---
The rashness of dealing is obvious enough; but
---
as far every attempt has been made.
---
them perceive
---
A general murmur of agreement
 followed the Commissioner's words, and
---
the meeting dispersed.
---
When they
 were gone
---
Why the devil did
---
" n't they take
 it?--
---
what do n't belong to me
---
When everything was ticketed
---
the auctions
 were in progress
---
they could see.


---
they wondered and

---
though nobody else did
---
that necessity had no choice
---
which seemed old enough

---
Trees to have been planted by the friars, and
---
the back
 hatch of the original mill yet formed a cascade which had raised its
 terrific roar for centuries.
---
The cottage itself was built of old
 stones from the long dismantled Priory, scraps of tracery, moulded
 window- jambs, and arch- labels,.


---
it was with amazement.
---
A smear of decisive lead- coloured paint had been laid on to
,.
---
though its letters dimly loomed through like
 ships in a fog
---
We work harder, but
---
It was fear made my few poor hairs so thin!
---
if yer mind is always in a larry
---
The intelligence was in a general sense true; and
---
when the new tenant had
 possession
---
Thenceforward the full sacks, looped with the shining chain,

---
went scurrying up and down under the cat- head, hairy arms were thrust
 out from the different door- ways, and
---
the grain was hauled in;
---
trusses
 of hay were tossed anew in and out of the barns, and
---
the wimbles
 creaked;.




32.



---
while the scales and steel- yards began
---
where
 guess- work had formerly been the rule
---
Two bridges stood near the lower part of Casterbridge town.
---
The first,
 of weather- stained brick, was immediately at the end of High Street,
; so that the precincts of the bridge formed
 the merging point of respectability and indigence.
---
where a diverging branch from that thoroughfare ran round to the
 low- lying Durnover lanes
---
The second bridge, of
 stone, was further out on the highway-- in fact, fairly in the meadows,
 though still within the town boundary.


---
These bridges had speaking countenances.
---
Every projection in each
 was worn down to obtuseness, partly by weather, more by friction from
 generations of loungers, whose toes and heels had from year to year
 made restless movements against these parapets, as they had stood there
 meditating on the aspect of affairs.
---
In the case of the more friable
 bricks and stones even the flat faces were worn into hollows by the same
 mixed mechanism.
---
The masonry of the top was clamped with iron at each
 joint;.


---
who had failed in business, in love, in sobriety, in crime
---
Why
 the unhappy hereabout usually chose the bridges for their meditations in
 preference to a railing, a gate, or a stile,.


---
There was a marked difference of quality between the personages who
 haunted the near bridge of brick and the personages who haunted the far
 one of stone.
---
Those of lowest character preferred the former,
---
adjoining
 the town; they did not mind the glare of the public eye.
---
They had been
 of comparatively no account during their successes; and
---
though they
 might feel dispirited
---
, they had no particular sense of shame in their
 ruin.
---
Their hands were mostly kept in their pockets
---
; they wore a leather
 strap round their hips or knees, and boots that required a great deal
 of lacing, but.
---
they spat
---
the iron had entered into
 their souls
---
they said
---
they were down on their luck
---
; so had Mother Cuxsom, Christopher Coney,
 and poor Abel Whittle.


---
who would pause on the remoter bridge
---
The miserables were of a politer
 stamp.
---
They included bankrupts, hypochondriacs, persons who were what is
 called" out of a situation" from fault or lucklessness, the inefficient
 of the professional class-- shabby- genteel men, who did not know how to
 get rid of the weary time between breakfast and dinner, and the yet more
 weary time between dinner and dark.
---
The eye of this species were mostly

---
was pretty sure to be one whom
 the world did not treat kindly for some reason or other.
---
whenever a stranger
 approached,
---
though every finned
 thing had been poached out of the river years before
---
There and thus they would muse
---
if their grief were the grief of
 oppression
---
; they would wish themselves kings
---
if their grief were
 poverty
---
;, wish themselves millionaires; if sin, they would wish
---
they were
 saints or angels
---
; if despised love, that they were some much- courted
 Adonis of county fame.
---
Some had been known; and
---
that eventually they had allowed
---
their
 poor carcases to follow that gaze
---
they were discovered the next
 morning out of reach of their troubles, either here or in the deep pool
 called Blackwater, a little higher up the river.


---
Which house is that?"


---
as somebody was sure to live there, and
---
you could n't
---
It was quite true
---
that it was doing him no harm
---
who
 had already taken the yards and stores
---
And you heard of that fellow
---
who bought all the best
 furniture at your sale
---
It has never been moved out of the house,."


---
" There's."
---
if you be willing to sell
---
; stared into the racing river till
 the bridge seemed.


---
The low land grew blacker, and the sky a deeper grey, When the landscape
 looked like a picture blotted in with ink
---
, another traveller approached
 the great stone bridge.
---
On the round of the middle of the arch the gig stopped."
---
that you think of emigrating
---
" Is
 it true?
---
Yes;
 it is true
---
where you were going to a few years ago,
---
Tis turn and
---
turn about, is n't
 it!
---
Do ye mind?
---
how we stood like this in the Chalk Walk
---
You then stood without a chattel to your name, and
---
the master of that house is you."


---
" Yes, yes; that's so!
---
It's the way
---
What's the odds after all!"


---
if it's
---
" The little
 money will just keep body and soul together for a few weeks, and
 no more.
---
my best chance is elsewhere."


---
is this--.
---
if ye will listen
---
We can spare some rooms very well--
---
until there's an opening for ye
---
Probably the picture was too striking to
."
---
" we should
 quarrel."


---
" You should hae a part to yourself
---
nobody to
 interfere wi' you.
---
It will be a deal healthier than down there by the
 river where you live now."


---
" You do n't know
---
what you ask
---
They walked into the town together side by side,."
---
as they had done
---
Will you come in
 and?
---
when they reached the middle of the
 town, where their paths diverged right and left
---
" Well, it was; but
---
you care
---
as may be endeared to
 ye by associations, or
---
And take them
 to your own house-- it will not be depriving me
---
, we can do with less very
 well, and"


---
" What-- give it to me for nothing?
---
But you paid the
 creditors for it!"


---
" Ah, yes; but maybe it's worth more to you."


---
than it is to me
---
it was hardly in human
 nature.


---
the eyes averted
---
when the door slammed
---
This
 time determined, and.
---
However, the ice was broken, and
---
now things seemed
.
---
that country farm trussing in the usual way
---
these arrangements worked well
---
For a time, it being the custom to truss
 in the respective stack- yards, before bringing it away
---
, the hay bought
 at the different farms about the neighbourhood;
---
When this was all done
---
it was rumoured about Casterbridge
---
that floats en
 upward
---
Ha- ha-- how cust odd it is!
---
who had

---
" Why d'ye say only a dozen days?"
---
In twelve days it will be
 twenty- one years, and!"


---
what was the matter
---
Elizabeth- Jane jumped up,.




33.



---
At this date there prevailed in Casterbridge a convivial
 custom-- scarcely recognized as such, yet none the less established.
---
The rear was usually brought up by the choir, with their
 bass- viols, fiddles, and flutes under their arms.


---
The great point, the point of honour, on these sacred occasions was
.
---
This
 scrupulosity was so well understood by the landlord.
---
that the whole
 company was served in cups of that measure
---
how many of these cups the landlord possessed

---
To wonder altogether was a favourite exercise of children in the marvellous.
---
Forty
 at least might have been seen at these times in the large room,.
---
Outside and above
 the forty cups came a circle of forty smoke- jets from forty clay pipes;
 outside the pipes the countenances of the forty church- goers, supported
 at the back by a circle of forty chairs.


---
The conversation was not the conversation of week- days, but a thing
 altogether finer in point and higher in tone.
---
They invariably
 discussed the sermon,.
---
the general tendency being
---
which had no relation to their own lives
---
critics and the thing criticized
---
The bass- viol player and the clerk
 usually spoke with more authority than the rest on account of their
 official connection with the preacher.


---
be well established in the large room by the time the forty church- goers
 entered to their customary cups
---
at once that the vow of twenty- one years had lapsed, and
---
the era of
 recklessness begun anew
---
that's true
---
; some of
 ye know the cause.
---
you
 fellows of the choir to strike up a tune
---
" With all my heart," said the first fiddle.
---
" We've let back our strings,
 but
---
that's true,
---
we can soon pull'em up again.
---
Sound A, neighbours, and
 give the man a stave."


---
what the words be
---
" Well-- heh, heh-- it may be
---
we can do that, and not a man among us
---
that
 have sat in the gallery less than twenty year," said the leader of the
 band.
---
" As' tis Sunday, neighbours, suppose?"


---
we raise the Fourth Psa'am,
 to Samuel Wakely's tune, as improved by me
---
as improved by thee
---
old Wiltshire is the only tune worth
 singing-- the psalm- tune that would make my blood ebb and flow like the
 sea when I was a steady chap.
---
their sermon having been a longer
 one than that the lower parish was favoured with
---
Where none can give relief
---
None shall be found.

        
---
Twasn't made for singing.
---
We chose it once
 but

---
when the gipsy stole the pa'son's mare,
---
pa'son were quite upset.
---
Whatever Servant David were thinking about, I ca n't
 fathom!
---
as improved
 by me
---
"' Od seize your sauce."
---
you shall
---
Not a single one
 of all the droning crew of ye goes out of this room till that
---
Psalm is

---
if you do n't wish to

---
your cust pates broke
---
, don't'ee take on so!--As' tis the Sabbath- day, and
---
" Do n't' ee' tis
 Servant David's words and not ours, perhaps we do n't mind for once,

---
hey?" said one of the terrified choir,.
---
So
 the instruments were tuned and
---
the comminatory verses sung.


---
" Do n't you blame David
---
But the bitter thing is, that
---
While they paused
---
it being their custom to take, like others, a short walk out on the
 highway and back, between church and tea- time
---
The players and singers turned their heads and."
---
Heaven
 forbid!" said the bass- player.


---
" Then if I'd known," said the performer on the clarionet solemnly!"


---
nothing should have drawn out of my
 wynd- pipe the breath for that Psalm,
---
" Nor from mine," said the first singer."
---
as it was made

---
;
 for there's nothing to be said against the tune."


---
I, as it was made
 so long ago perhaps there is n't much in it I'll oblige a neighbour" Ah, my boys, you've sung it
---
as if it were a twig
---
It was at this time.

---
that Elizabeth- Jane, having heard, entered the room with a pale and agonized countenance
---
The choir and the rest of the company moved off, in accordance with
 their half- pint regulation.
---
together they went on.
---
" What will you do?
---
they went on."
---
Then one afternoon the green door opened, and.
---
it being obvious
---
that might
 seem like triumphing over a fallen rivel
---
For we humble workmen here feel it a great honour that a
 lady should look in and take an interest in us
---
; the sarcasm was too bitter, too
 unendurable.


---
" Can you tell me the time, ma'am?
---
before we are released from work
---
Ah, ma'am, we of the lower classes know nothing of the gay leisure that
 such as you enjoy!"


---
was obvious.
---
" will you kindly undertake,?
---
you used to- day
---
" Poor fool!" said.
---
The gulf between them was growing wider
 every day.
---
it was impossible.
---
Often did Elizabeth- Jane,
---
Each floor had a door opening into the air under a
 cat- head, from which a chain dangled for hoisting the sacks.


---
But it would have been possible, by a comparatively light
 touch,.


---
as they turned
---
that the movement was an idle eccentricity, and no more
---
It was not yet light.
---
; a dense fog prevailed, and
---
the town was
 as silent as it was dark, except that from the rectangular avenues which
 framed in the borough there came a chorus of tiny rappings, caused by
 the fall of water- drops condensed on the boughs
---
; now it was wafted from
 the West Walk, now from the South Walk; and then from both quarters
 simultaneously
---
And what may it be?

---
It's very kind of ye
---
" But we are the best of friends?"

" Or.
---
" But we are quite friendly?"

" Or."
---
that would injure you--
---
Every
 word cost her twice its length of pain.
---
Thus they parted, and
---
journeymen now being in
 the street,
---
waggoners going to the harness- makers for articles left to

---
, farm- horses going to the shoeing- smiths, and
---
the sons of
 labour showing themselves generally on the move.
---
as if nothing had occurred
---
which is
---
if they would make up the other fifty among them
---
there's nothing to say against it for that
 matter
---
But, Farfrae,
 others see.
---
what you do n't
---
that you should know it
---
" Is that so--
---
ah, is that so?
---
" God only knows
---
," said Joyce,.
---
" It shows, and."


---
who will deny him such a little as that
---
But a damp having
 been thrown over it by these and other voices in the air
---
The then occupier of the shop was in it.


---
that the intentions of the Council had been changed
---
The occupier was much disappointed, and.
---
And thus out of error
 enmity grew.


---
the tea- kettle was singing on the
 high hob of the semi- egg- shaped grate
---
See-- the blinds are
 not drawn down, and
---
the people can look in-- what a scandal!"


---
When the candles were lighted
---
, the curtains drawn, and
---
the twain sat at
 tea
---
" Who has called?
---
" What's the matter, Donald?"


---
You will get through it
---
, Scotchmen are always
 lucky."


---
And poor Willie Dunbleeze
 and Maitland Macfreeze-- they fell into bad courses, and!"


---
You are always so literal.
---
when we have finished tea
---
sing to- night!
---
why there should be
 a wee bit of envy
---
Now, can you, Lucetta?
---
It is more like old- fashioned
 rivalry in love than just a bit of rivalry in trade."


---
refuse it.
---
What have you heard-- O Donald, dearest
---
" No, no-- it is not so serious as ye fancy
---
you would do
---
what we have talked of
---
We have plenty of
 money, and
---
why should we stay?"


---
they talked
 thereon.
---
till a visitor was announced
---
Their neighbour Alderman Vatt came
 in.


---
You've heard
---
Yes-- died
 this afternoon at five," said Mr. Vatt.
---
Chalkfield was the Councilman who
 had succeeded to the Mayoralty in the preceding November.


---
Mr. Vatt continued:"
---
Well, we
 know, and
---
we must take it all.
---
as it is
---
there should be
 no particular opposition,
---
" But there are folk whose turn is before mine; and
---
several have named it.
---
You
 wo n't refuse?"


---
We thought of going away
---
" It was only a fancy
---
" refuse."


---
if it is the
 wish of a respectable majority in the Council
---
how it's ourselves
---
that
 are ruled by the Powers above us
---
We plan this, but
---
we do that.
---
If they
 want, and
---
It was in the bustle of the
 market,.


---
when no one could readily notice their discourse
---
that you may
 have
---
unless you have destroyed them
---
You must see."


---
that the time at Jersey should be blotted out, for the good of all
 parties
---
the woman!--I packed up every scrap of your handwriting to

---
what I asked you months
 ago---- you never appeared."


---
And what became of the parcel then?
---
The letters might have been amongst them.


---
Had that safe been
 opened?


---
which followed this
---
On the very evening there was a great ringing of
 bells in Casterbridge, and the combined brass, wood, catgut, and leather
 bands played round the town with more prodigality of percussion- notes
 than ever.
---
which this election had established
---
" If so, it is there now
---
It was not of much consequence-- to me
---
if you do n't mind
---
It was quite late.
---
Whatever it was
---
; the movements of the doors were revivals of dead
 days.


---
" Never mind," said Henchard drily.
---
" The fact is....
---
they are letters
 mostly
---
here they be
---
You do n't
 forget
---
These letters are, in fact,.
---
Though,
 thank God, it is all over now."


---
So that these
 reproaches do not now cause me any twinges, as they
 might otherwise have done....
---
"' For me,'" Henchard read,"' there is practically no future.
---
you are the door through which wrong has come
 to me.
---
is a consolation so far as it goes-- but
---
how far does it
 go?
---
forsaken by my few acquaintance, and
---
forsaken by
 you
---
" That's,
---
when what had happened
---
But the
 fact was
---
that Aphrodite ever
 spoke thus,
---
" Ah-- well you may ask that!"
---
it would be sailing too near the wind
---
" The young lady must have had a heart that bore transplanting very
 readily!"


---
The truth was
---
who it should be
---
that would call
 at that comparatively late hour
---
that somebody was admitted there
---
presently
 the indistinct murmur of a person reading became audible.


---
the reading and conversation went on.
---
This was very singular.
---
but that some extraordinary crime had been committed,
 and
---
that the visitor,, was reading an account of it
 from a special edition of the Casterbridge Chronicle
---
as the crackling of paper denoted
---
what was
 intended for your eye alone
---
if it were known
---
as it had once seemed
---
The door slammed
---
who had just been

---
that was irksome
---
This was sufficient.
---
Well-- I'm obliged to' ee for listening.
---
; for in such cases we attribute to an enemy a power
 of consistent action which we never find in ourselves or in our friends;
 and.


---
that abortive efforts from want of heart are as possible to
 revenge as to generosity
---
The bold stroke of telling Donald the truth, dimly
 conceived, was yet too bold;,
---
The very thought of it crushes me!
---
If you could see me.
---
you would relent
---
You do not know
.
---
how anxiety has told upon me lately
---
you leave work--.
---
just before the sun goes down
---
you face to face
---
that you will carry no further
---
If ever tears and
 pleadings have served the weak
---
them do so now
---
The interior was shadowy,
 and emphatic of the absence of every living thing.


---
Nor could any one else have known.
---
The truth was.
---
who had stood there and thus in bygone days
---
ee looking so ill
---
How can you be sorry
---
when you
 deliberately cause it
---
" What!" said Henchard uneasily.
---
" Is it anything I have done?"


---
that has
 pulled you down like that
---
" It is all your doing
---
My happiness
 would be secure enough but for your threats.
---
You might think!
---
that you have done enough
---
" Well, what do you want?"
---
me to do
---
My reading of those letters was only a sort of practical
 joke, and
---
" To give me back the letters and any papers you may have that breathe of
 matrimony or worse."


---
" So be it.
---
Every scrap shall be yours....
---
" But you shall have the
 letters without fail.
---
And your secret shall be kept.
---
It is a thing I know nothing about
---
" But you can testify to my trustworthiness better than anybody, ma'am,
---
that a word or two from you would secure for me
---
the wood laid across them for heating the morning kettle.

---
you would do me a service, Jopp,
 now-- to- night,,
---
if you can
---
" Well, how have ye got on to- day?."
---
" There never will be in Casterbridge
---
" You must roam further afield."
---
that it
 had formed itself into a head like a red- hot cauliflower
---
What could be inside it?
---
curiosity to learn
---
that the efficacy of such a
 fastening depended on this
---
that the bundle consisted of letters
---
which stood at the end of High Street
---
" We be just going down Mixen Lane way,
---
to look into Peter's Finger afore
 creeping to bed," said Mrs. Cuxsom.
---
" There's a fiddle and tambourine
 going on there.
---
Lord, what's all the world-- do ye come along too,
 ye five minutes."


---
Jopp--'twon't hinder
---
Though the upper part of Durnover was mainly composed of a curious
 congeries of barns and farm- steads
---
, there was a less picturesque side to
 the parish.
---
This was Mixen Lane, now in great part pulled down.


---
Mixen Lane was the Adullam of all the surrounding villages.
---
It was the
 hiding- place of those who were in distress, and in debt, and trouble
 of every kind.
---
who combined a little
 and a little brawling and bibbing with
 their poaching
---
Farm- labourers and other peasants, poaching with their farming,, found themselves sooner or later in Mixen Lane.
---
Rural
 mechanics too idle to mechanize, rural servants too rebellious to serve,
 drifted or.


---
The lane and its surrounding thicket of thatched cottages stretched out
 like a spit into the moist and misty lowland.
---
that was sad
---
that was low
---
that were baneful
---
, some things, could be seen in
 Mixen Lane.
---
Vice ran freely in and out certain of the doors in the
 neighbourhood
---
Even slaughter had not
 been altogether unknown here.
---
gone by
---
Yet this mildewed leaf in the sturdy and flourishing Casterbridge plant
 lay close to the open country; not a hundred yards from a row of
 noble elms, and.
---
A brook divided the moor from
 the tenements, and to outward view there was no way across it-- no way
 to the houses but round about by the road.
---
But under every householder's
 stairs there was kept a mysterious plank nine inches wide; which plank
 was a secret bridge.


---
If you, as one of those refugee householders, came in from business
 after dark-- and
---
this was the business time here
---
-- you stealthily crossed
 the moor,.
---
to which you belonged
---
A shape thereupon made its
 appearance on the other side bearing the bridge on end against the sky
---
it was lowered
---
;
; you crossed, and
---
a hand helped you.

---
You sold them slily the next morning, and the day after you stood
 before the magistrates with the eyes of all your sympathizing neighbours
 concentrated on your back.
---
You disappeared for a time
---
; then you were
 again found.


---
Walking along the lane at dusk the stranger was struck by two or three
 peculiar features therein.
---
One was an intermittent rumbling from the
 back premises of the inn half- way up
---
; this meant a skittle alley.

---
Another was the extensive prevalence of whistling in the various
 domiciles-- a piped note of some kind coming from nearly every open door.

---
Yet amid so much that was bad needy respectability
---
also found a home.

---
whose presence
 there was due to the iron hand of necessity,
---
Families
 from decayed villages-- families of that once bulky, but now
 nearly extinct, section of village society called" liviers," or
 lifeholders-- copyholders and others, whose roof- trees had fallen for
 some reason or other,--,.


---
that had
 been their home for generations
---
unless they chose
---
The inn called Peter's Finger
---
was the church of Mixen Lane.


---
It was centrally situate,.
---
as such places should be, and
---
At first sight the inn was so respectable as to be
.
---
The front door was kept, and
---
the step was so clean that
 evidently but few persons entered over its sanded surface.
---
Half- way up the alley was a narrow door, shiny and
 paintless from the rub of infinite hands and shoulders.
---
This was the
 actual entrance to the inn.


---
A pedestrian would be seen; and

---
the gazer to blink like
 Ashton at the disappearance of Ravenswood
---
The company at the Three Mariners were persons of quality in comparison
 with the company which gathered here;.
---
though it must be admitted
---
that
 the lowest fringe of the Mariner's party touched the crest of Peter's at
 points
---
Waifs and strays of all sorts loitered about here.
---
which they sat down
---
The settles on
 were thin and tall
---
, their tops being guyed by pieces
 of twine to hooks in the ceiling; for when the guests grew boisterous
 the settles would rock and overturn without some such security.
---
The
 thunder of bowls echoed from the backyard
---
; swingels hung behind the
 blower of the chimney; and.


---
who in past
 times had met in fights under the moon
---
where they sat calmly

---
how you could jerk a trout ashore with a bramble, and not
 ruffle the stream, Charl
---
" Dost mind?" a deposed keeper was saying."'
---
if you can mind
---
But the worst larry for me was that pheasant business
 at Yalbury Wood.
---
-- there's
---
" That I can." How was that?
---
" Why-- Joe closed wi' me, and
---
it being dark under the trees
---
which was uppermost
---
till we'd roll over again
---
when we got up in hall
---
that's.
---
that we'd picked off as

---
It did hurt my feelings!...
---
" I might have had' ee days afore that," said the keeper.
---
that the world gets wind of
---
who, lately settled in this purlieu
---
" Ah, therein lies a grand secret
---
" It is the passion of
 love.
---
that stands high in this town
---
's hear'em, good soul
---
then let," said Mother Cuxsom.

---
what fools we used?
---
when we were
 younger
---
These passages soon began
---
though the
 epistles, being allusive only
---
" True," said Mrs. Cuxsom,."
---
it ought.
---
I knowed The last
 one seen in Casterbridge must have been ten years ago, if a day."


---
At this moment there was a shrill whistle, and
---
Tis Jim coming in
---
Would ye go and?"


---
Beyond the stream
 was the open moor, from which a clammy breeze smote upon their faces
 as they advanced.
---
that had lain in readiness one
 of them
---
Taking up the board lowered it across the water, and
---
the instant its further end
 touched the ground footsteps entered upon it, and
---
Before,
 however, they had entered the house a cry of" Ahoy" from the moor led
 them to pause.


---
The cry was repeated.
---
They pushed the lantern into an outhouse, and.


---
" Ahoy-- is this the way to Casterbridge?
---
" said some one from the other
 side.


---
" Not in particular," said Charl.
---
" There's a river afore' ee."


---
I do n't care"

" Stop a minute, then," said Charl,.

---
You should have kept along the turnpike road, friend, and not have
 strook across here."


---
that's an outlying house
---
The plank was now lowered; and
---
the stranger's form shaped itself
 from the darkness.
---
when they reached the door
---
" I should-- as I see now. But I saw a light here, and."

" Ah, perhaps it will suit me.
---
This was barred, and
---
while the landlady was

---
the conversation about the skimmington was continued in
 the sitting- room, and
---
What do they mean by a' skimmity- ride'?
---
" O, sir!" said the landlady,
---
they do
---
" Still, are they going?
---
It is a good sight to see,
---
And it costs money.
---
you are talking of
---
" There were more where that one came from
---
But as a respectable
 householder I do n't encourage it.

 It is a good sight to see, I
 suppose? I remember. Now I shall be in
 Casterbridge for two or three weeks, and. Here, good folks; I should like, and I do n't mind," said Charl.

---
when the
 sovereign had been taken up and
---
" By George! we ought."


---
" No, no," answered the landlady.
---
This is a respectable house
---
what's honourable.
---
now we'll consider, and
---
the business begun
---
We will
---
A good laugh warms my heart more than a cordial,
 and
---
that's the truth on't."


---
it being now somewhat late
---
For though hers had been rather the laxity of inadvertence
 than of intention
---
Such was the state of things.
---
when the current affairs of Casterbridge
 were interrupted by an event of such magnitude that its influence
 reached to the lowest social stratum there, stirring the depths of its
 society simultaneously with the preparations for the skimmington
---
It
 was one of those excitements which, when they move a country town, leave
 permanent mark upon its chronicles, as a warm summer.


---
which, as a representative
 centre of husbandry, wished thus
---
Royalty had not been seen in Casterbridge since the days of the third
 King George, and then only by candlelight for a few minutes, when that
 monarch, on a night- journey, had stopped to change horses at the
 King's Arms.
---
The inhabitants therefore decided.
---
Half- an- hour's pause was not long
---
,
 it is true; but
---
much might be done in it by a judicious grouping of
 incidents, above all,.


---
if the weather were fine
---
The address was.
---
prepared on parchment by an artist who was handy at
 ornamental lettering, and
---
The Council had met on
 the Tuesday before the appointed day,.
---
While they were sitting
---
, the door of the Council Chamber
 standing open, they heard.
---
a heavy footstep coming up the stairs
---
Embarrassed glances were exchanged by the Council and Grower, so gnawed he it during the silence.

---
as spokesman
 was obliged
---
that the duty should
 have fallen to another tongue
---
that it would be proper
---
The
 Council are the Council, and
---
as ye are no longer one of the body
---
, there
 would be an irregularity in the proceeding.
---
If ye were included
---
"; it is out of the question, indeed.
---
But of course you
 can see the doings full well, such as they are to be, like the rest of
 the spectators."


---
opposition crystallized
 it into a determination.
---
You shall see."


---
The eventful morning was bright, a full- faced sun confronting early
 window- gazers eastward, and all perceived( for they were practised in
 weather- lore) that there was permanence in the glow.
---
Visitors soon began
.
---
There was
 hardly a workman in the town who did not put a clean shirt on.
---
from which they found a difficulty in
 getting back to the proper hour for several days
---
It was lucky
---
my twenty- one years had expired, or
---
before this came on
---
Shall we go and?
---
You see it.
---
It will be worth seeing!"


---
As the appointed time drew near
---
Suddenly the taller members of the crowd turned their heads, and
---
the
 shorter stood on tiptoe.
---
It was said.

---
that the Royal cortege approached
---
The railway had stretched out an arm towards Casterbridge at this time,
 but;.
---
so that the intervening
 distance, as well as the remainder of the journey, was
---
to be traversed
 by road in the old fashion
---
People thus waited-- the county families
 in their carriages, the masses on foot-- and.


---
From the background Elizabeth- Jane watched the scene.
---
Some seats had
 been arranged
---
from which ladies could witness the spectacle, and
---
as it seemed
---
as that is so largely by the superficies of things
---
Everybody else, from the
 Mayor to the washerwoman, shone in new vesture; but

---
Hence, alas, this occurred:.
---
the Corporation in their robes proceeded from the front of the Town
 Hall to the archway erected at the entrance to the town.
---
, a procession was formed, and
---
the whole came on to the
 Town Hall at a walking pace.


---
This spot was the centre of interest.
---
There were a few clear yards in
 front of the Royal carriage,.
---
All the ladies said with bated breath,"!"
---
Elizabeth- Jane peeped through the shoulders of those in
 front,; and
---
what it was
---
" Do you say?"
---
Oh-- is that all?
---
They have been saying to me.
---
What stories people
 will tell!"


---
" They will indeed.
---
It was not so at all.
---
The incident had
 occupied but a few moments, but
---
it was necessarily witnessed by the
 Royal Personage, who, however, with practised tact affected.
---
, the Mayor advanced,
---
the address
 was read
---
; the Illustrious Personage replied,
---
the carriages rattled heavily as
 Pharaoh's chariots down Corn Street and out upon the Budmouth Road, in
 continuation of the journey coastward.


---
Yet how folk do worship fine clothes!
---
that nobody notices at all
---
the trimming pulled off such Christmas candles
---
that lady toppered
---
" That's not a noble passiont for a' oman to keep up
---
every one knew.
---
The ideas
 had
 condensed into a scandal, which was spreading like a miasmatic fog
 through Mixen Lane, and thence up the back streets of Casterbridge.


---
The mixed assemblage of idlers known to each other presently fell apart
 into two bands by a process of natural selection,
---
the frequenters of
 Peter's Finger going off Mixen Lanewards, where most of them lived,
.


---
" You know
---
what's brewing down there
---
" said Buzzford
 mysteriously to the others.


---
Buzzford nodded.


---
if it will be carried out
---
If they
 are getting it up
---
" they are keeping it mighty close.


---
they were thinking of it a fortnight ago, at all events
---
We know
---
, that's their business, not ours."


---
it must
 be owned.
---
as the Mayor and man of money, engrossed with affairs and
 ambitions
---
we make inquiration into it
---
if we find
---
there's really anything in it
---
This course was decided on, and.
---
the group separated,
---
's move on
---
There's nothing more to
 see here."


---
These well- intentioned ones would have been surprised
---
had they known."
---
how
 ripe the great jocular plot really was
---
As a wind- up to the
 Royal visit the hit will be all the more pat by reason of their great
 elevation to- day."


---
whom an
 intoxicating Weltlust had fairly mastered
---
they had brought her a
 great triumph nevertheless.
---
So
 you've had a snub
---
" Why, I've had one too, so we are both under the same cold shade."
---
it could not be settled there
---
It must come to a tussle-- face to face; and
---
as if I were a bull breaking fence I
 took it like a lamb, for I saw. then we'll see!"


---
After the
 crowning degradation had been reserved for this day--
---
The crowds had dispersed.
---
which still stood

---
as they were erected
---
But for the green arches Casterbridge life had resumed its ordinary shape.

---
Nobody was present, for,
---
, the labourers and
 carters were enjoying a half- holiday on account of the events of the
 morning--.
---
though the carters would have
---
It was empty except of a few sacks, and
---
that hoisted the
 sacks
---
There was a
 depth of thirty or forty feet to the ground
---
that
 green door opened and
---
which told
---
" Why does the infernal fool begin that now!"


---
" Will ye come up here?
---
What's wrang?"


---
" What are you doing up here at this time?
---
so that it went tight into its frame
---
" we stand face to face-- man and man.
---
as they did
---
but
 now, and my poverty does not press me down.
---
" What does it all mean?
---
You should ha' thought twice.
---
you forward stripling
---
" You insulted Royalty, Henchard; and."


---
" Royalty be damned
---
you will see things the same way as I do."


---
" You may be the one to cool first
---
" Now this
 is the case.
---
Here be we,.
---
that
 little wrestle you began this morning
---
There's the door, forty foot
 above ground.
---
One of us two puts the other out by that door--.
---
the master
 stays inside
---
that the other has fallen out by accident
---
D'ye understand?
---
thus far the struggle had very much the appearance of the ordinary
 wrestling of those parts
---
Several minutes were passed by them in this
 attitude
---
, the pair rocking and, both
.
---
By this time their breathing could be
 heard.
---
this is the end of what you
 began this morning
---
Your life is in my hands."


---
Ye've wished!"


---
their eyes met."
---
O
 Farfrae!--that's not true!"
---
what you will
---
Its womanliness sat tragically on the figure of so stern a piece of
 virility.
---
till the thin shades thickened to opaque obscurity, and

---
the loft- door became an oblong of gray light-- the only visible shape
 around
---
It would therefore be useless.


---
There was no help for it but.
---
They were a
 confusion of rhythmical noises, to which the streets added yet more
 confusion by encumbering them with echoes.
---
that the clangour arose from the town band,
---
was contradicted by certain peculiarities of reverberation.
---
that the satirical mummery should fall flat,
---
if it
 were attempted
---
By giving open information they would have brought down
 upon their heads the vengeance of those among their comrades who enjoyed
 these boisterous old games; and
---
therefore the plan of sending a letter
 recommended itself by its indirectness.


---
It was about eight o'clock, and
---
Night had set in for more than half an hour, but
---
the candles lighted,,
---
if it were not too cold
---
The day had been such
 a success, and
---
in which these and other subjects mingled
---
The reverie was disturbed by
 a hubbub in the distance, that increased moment by moment.
---
the afternoon having been given up to recreation
 by a majority of the populace since the passage of the Royal equipages
---
" Which way be they going now?
---
" inquired the first with interest.


---
," said the second," because of the
 malter's chimbley.
---
" They are coming up Corn Street after all!
---
O yes-- I can see'em. Well, I declare, I declare!"

 They sit back to back!"


---
" What-- two of' em-- are there two figures?"


---
back to back, their elbows tied to one

---
"

" Is it meant for anybody in particular?
---
" Well-- it mid be.
---
The din was increasing now
---
-- then it lessened a little.


---
" They have gone into a back street--
---
that's all
---
-- I sha n't see, after all!"," said the one who
 occupied the enviable position in the attic.
---
if' tis
 meant for one I've in mind
---
I can tell in a moment."

" My-- why--'tis dressed!"


---
Elizabeth- Jane advanced into the
 firelight.


---
you have not shut your shutters
---
the window
 is open."


---
it be-- hush!
---
Again Elizabeth- Jane attempted, but
---
that the latter knew it already
---
us shut it out
---
us shut it out
---
It is of no use!"
---
O, it will kill me--!"


---
Elizabeth- Jane was frantic now.
---
O, ca n't something be done?
---
" Is there nobody?"


---
The numerous
 lights round the two effigies
---
threw them up into lurid distinctness; it
 was impossible.


---
me shut the window
---
The roars of sarcastic laughter went off in ripples, and
---
the
 trampling died out like the rustle of a spent wind.
---
who remained convulsed on the carpet in the paroxysms of
 an epileptic seizure
---
, were quite
 closed, a light was obtained,.
---
what had passed the fit

---
The doctor arrived with unhoped- for promptitude
---
what the uproar meant
---
As soon,
" This is serious."


---
" It is a fit
---
The
 doctor returned to the bedside again.
---
they
 soon heard.


---
to search hither and thither for the constables, there were two in the
 town,.


---
that they
 might be roughly handled
---
" What can we two poor lammigers do against such a multitude!"
 
---
that would be the death of the
 perpetrator
---
we would n't be the cause of a fellow- creature's death
 on no account, not we!"


---
We'll see.
---
what a few
 words of authority can do
---
Quick now; have you got your staves?"


---
" We did n't want the folk to notice us as law officers,
---
being so
 short- handed, sir; so we pushed up this
 water- pipe."


---
Ah, here's Mr.
 Blowbody; that's lucky."
---
( Blowbody was the third of the three borough
 magistrates.)


---
" Well, what's the row?"
---
said Blowbody.
---
" you go with Mr.
 Blowbody round by the Old Walk and; and
---
By this plan we shall have'em between us.

---
Thus they started.
---
the sounds had proceeded
---
But, whence, they were surprised that no
 procession could be seen.
---
The lamp flames waved.
---
, the Walk trees soughed,
---
a few
 loungers stood about with their hands in their pockets
---
Everything was
 as usual.


---
" Have you seen a motley crowd making a disturbance?"
---
the person addressed,
---
who was no
 other than Charl, of Peter's Finger
---
No; we have n't
 seen anything;?
---
And you was here afore
---
-- that's odd
---
But I've not been far tonight, so perhaps--"

" Oh,' twas here-- just here," said the magistrate.


---
that the wind in the Walk trees
 makes
---
d'ye think?
---
Constable, come this way.
---
Now I've noticed I'm a fool They must
 have gone into the back street."


---
Neither in back street nor in front street, however, could the
 disturbers be perceived, and
---
who
 came up at this time
---
Blowbody and the second constable,, brought similar intelligence.
---
Effigies, donkey,
 lanterns, band, all had disappeared like the crew of Comus.


---
there's only one thing more we can do
---
if you do n't find a clue to the perpetrators
 there
---
The rusty- jointed executors of the law mustered assistance as soon as
 they could, and
---
the whole party marched off to the lane of notoriety.
---
It
 was no rapid matter to get there at night, not a lamp or glimmer of
 any sort offering itself to light the way, except an occasional pale
 radiance through some window- curtain, or through the chink of some door
 which could not be closed because of the smoky chimney within.
---
At last
 they entered the inn boldly, by the till then bolted front- door, after a
 prolonged knocking of loudness commensurate with the importance of their
 standing.


---
In the settles of the large room, guyed to the ceiling by cords as
 usual for stability
---
, an ordinary group sat drinking and smoking with
 statuesque quiet of demeanour.
---
The landlady looked mildly at the
 invaders,.
---
Good evening, gentlemen; there's
 plenty of room
---
there's nothing amiss
---
They looked round the room."
---
who was Charl
---
that you have
---
" I've been here this
 last hour, hain't I, Nance?" you were here then, as well as all the rest."


---
that's
---
what we keep here
---
when
 there's a little quiet dancing
---
You see,
---
The constable nodded knowingly, but
---
was nothing.
---
Nohow
 could anything be elicited from this mute and inoffensive assembly.
---
In
 a few minutes the investigators went out, and.




40.



---
who had been left at the door they pursued their way

---
what it all meant
---
They crossed the way,.
---
the roysterers having vanished
---
what had occurred
---
how they had set out to

---
no messenger was despatched towards Weatherbury
---
which clothed the heights
 on either hand
---
presently there came the sound of light wheels
 whetting their felloes against the newly stoned patches of road,
.


---
accompanied by the distant glimmer of lights
---
as its driver
 slackened speed between two plantations
---
It was a point in the highway near which the road to Mellstock branched
 off from the homeward direction.
---
It soon appeared, the
 light swerving towards Cuckoo Lane, the by- road aforesaid.
---
the horse to turn several steps into the branch lane

---
" There's something
 wrong at your house--.
---
what was only too obvious
---
" But," the matter is more serious than your business
 at Mellstock.
---
as we go along
---
what you think
---
what you
 think
---
they want.
---
you to come
---
my heart is true to
 you still!"


---
there might be
 ironies now.
---
Over this repentant
 sinner, at least, there was.
---
as the door opened
---
they all said in grievous
 disappointment,"!"
---
" said the doctor.


---
" Yes.... I can not tell' ee!"" H'm," said the surgeon,.


---
who formed one of the group
---
Death was, and Farfrae and himself the
 shells.
---
There had been affection in it, and
---
above
 all things was affection from anything that was good
 and pure.
---
As the latter entered

---
Somebody has called for you
---
A messenger was despatched to Budmouth,
---
late as it had grown
---
; the night
 wore on, and
---
the other doctor came in the small hours.
---
an apprehensive guess having been given as to its cause by the
 leaders in the exploit, compunction and fear;.


---
when they were alone in the solitude of

---
who called the hours and weather in Casterbridge
 that night
---
Besides the watchman there walked a figure up and down Corn Street hardly less
 frequently.
---
Lucifer was fading into day across Durnover Moor,

---
the sparrows were
---
the hens had begun
.
---
the door gently opened,
---
which had muffled it
---
did they believe in human aggression at so early a time
---
" Why do you take off that?"
---
Because they may knock as
 loud
---
as they will
---
The morning having now fully broke.
---
when a gentle
 footstep approached the house and
---
" Have you heard?
---
It
 is so very good of' ee, Elizabeth,.
---
You must be
 so tired out, too, with sitting up.
---
Now do you bide here with me this
 morning.
---
You can go and; and
---
when
 breakfast is ready
---
as though
 that way alone could happiness lie
---
," said the stranger with profuse heartiness.

---
that's right.
---
" Then I've caught' ee at home-- Morning's the time for
 business, says?"


---
" You may remember me?"
---
" Well-- perhaps you may not.
---
The other did not notice it.
---
Well, the fact is, this fortnight past.
---
, they told me.
---
you had
---
,' says they.
---
perhaps the less said
 about it, in one sense, the better."


---
Poor Susan-- hers was a strange
 experience."


---
what they call
 shrewd or sharp at all
---
As you in all likelihood know
---
" There lay the sting o't to me.
---
what it was
---
,"
  said the sailor of former days.
---
there was not much
 vanity in thinking it,.
---
Your child died
---
all went well
---
But a time
 came-- mind me, a time always does come.
---
A time came
---
-- it was some while
--.
---
then came the question of our child
---
it was best
---
there was a storm, and
---
it was supposed.
---
that a lot of
 us, including myself, had been washed overboard
---
the child will have
 a home
---
They told me in Falmouth.
---
Surely you learnt that too?"


---
The sailor started up, and.

---
Then what's the use of my money to
 me?"


---
" the traveller inquired.


---
" A year ago and more," replied the other without hesitation.


---
The sailor continued.
---
My journey hither has been for nothing
---
It has served me right.
---
It had been the impulse of a
 moment.
---
But surely they would come
---
The coach Newson had come by to
 move again.
---
I may as I came I'll trouble you no longer."

 Was Elizabeth- Jane?"
---
the
 trick would be discovered.


---
was exposed.


---
the distant highway expecting
---
But no figure appeared.

---
cooled by years
---
half expecting
---
How strange it is that
 we do not often dream of latest events, absorbing as they may be.
---
which gave her a pleasant surprise
---
They sat down to breakfast, and
---
Their sadness added charm to a countenance whose beauty had
 ever lain in its meditative soberness.


---
so kind of you to get this nice breakfast with your own
 hands
---
You have left me
---
"; everybody has left
 me;
---
You are very lonely
---
", are you not?"


---
that you know nothing of
---
It is my own fault.

---
You are the only one who has been near me for weeks.
---
And you will come
 no more."


---
" Why do you say that?
---
if you would like
---
it were best
---
When they had breakfasted
---
till the
 moment arrived
---
There would remain nobody.
---
But hard fate had ordained.


---
; there was nothing
 to come, nothing to wait for.
---
The thought of it was unendurable.


---
through which much
 water flowed
---
who should stand still
 for a few moments on a quiet night
---
The wanderer in this direction, might hear singular symphonies from
 these waters, as from a lampless orchestra,.
---
At a hole in a rotten weir
 they executed a recitative;
---
where a tributary brook fell over a stone
 breastwork they trilled cheerily
---
; under an arch they performed a
 metallic cymballing, and
---
at Durnover Hole they hissed.
---
The spot at
 which their instrumentation rose loudest
---
was a place called Ten Hatches,
 whence during high springs there proceeded a very fugue of sounds.


---
The river here was deep and strong at all times, and
---
the hatches on this
 account were raised and.
---
lowered by cogs and a winch
---
A patch led
 from the second bridge over the highway
---
But
 after night- fall human beings were seldom found.


---
the
 passage being dangerous
---
proceeded to the
 second, or stone bridge, and thence struck into this path of solitude,
 following its course beside the stream till the dark shapes of the Ten
 Hatches cut the sheen thrown upon the river by the weak lustre that
 still lingered in the west.
---
where the water was at its deepest
---
no creature appeared in view.
---
beneath there slowly became
 visible a something floating in the circular pool formed by the wash of
 centuries;.
---
At first
 it was indistinct by reason of the shadow from the bank; but
---
it emerged
 thence and.


---
which was that of a human body,
---
imparted by the central flow
---
the form was

---
as one might have done in the actual presence of an
 appalling miracle
---
you seemed very sad this morning
---
But everybody
 and everything seem against you so, and
---
you must be suffering
---
Are miracles still worked Elizabeth
---
, do ye think,
---
there are any miracles nowadays
---
But will you come and
, and
---
what it was.
---
It seemed.


---
" Are they like mine?
---
" Well-- they are.
---
us go away
---
then we will get home."


---
" what do you say now?"


---
us go home
---
it floating there
---
" They must have thrown it into the
 river higher up amongst the willows at Blackwater,, and
---
it must have floated
 down here."


---
But where is the other?
---
Elizabeth- Jane thought and."
---
as
 they slowly retraced their way to the town, and
---
your being poor
---
you did

---
" May you come to me?"
---
If
 you only would come!"


---
" How will you forgive all my roughness in former days?
---
at
 length each went home.
---
The next morning the fact turned out
---
as Elizabeth- Jane had stated
---
But as little as possible was said of the
 matter, and
---
the figures were privately destroyed.


---
that the figure should have been floating there
---
Elizabeth- Jane heard!
---
Who is such a reprobate as I
---
" I have forgotten it. And yet it
 seems!"





---
But the emotional conviction began.
---
as time slowly removed into distance the event
 which had given that feeling birth
---
till the funeral was

---
as the result had been
---
Disastrous, it was obviously in no way foreseen
 or.

---
intended by the thoughtless crew who arranged the motley procession
---
who stand at the
 head of affairs
---
who writhe
 under the heel of the same
---
The tempting prospect of putting to the blush people-- that supreme and piquant enjoyment of those-- had alone.
---
Other considerations
 were also involved.
---
To
 regard the event as an untoward accident seemed, to Farfrae, truest
 consideration for the dead one's memory, as well as best philosophy.


---
Here they settled themselves; and
---
that the lie had not been deliberately told to that end, but

---
which took no
 thought of consequences
---
Thus they lived on in the shop overlooking the churchyard, and
---
nothing
 occurred.
---
that it was
---
that it was not
---
whose hearts insist upon a dogged fidelity to some image or

---
cause thrown by chance into their keeping,
---
long after their judgment has

---
without them the
 band of the worthy is incomplete.
---
It
 was inevitable.
---
which must have come sooner or later in any circumstances
---
the stepfather and daughter enjoyed much serenity in the pleasant, sunny
 corner in which it stood.
---
who brimmed with an
 inner activity
---
The quiet bearing of one characterized Elizabeth- Jane at this period.
---
" You have got a new muff, Elizabeth
---
as it lay on an adjoining table
---
The fur was of a
 glossy brown, and,
---
" Rather costly, was it not?
---
" It was rather above my figure
---
" But it is not
 showy."


---
when the year had advanced into another spring
---
The present room was much
 humbler, but
---
was the abundance of books lying
 everywhere.
---
Their number and quality made.
---
that
 supported them
---
the meagre furniture seem absurdly disproportionate
---
Some, indeed many, must
 have been recently purchased; and
---
But, the courage to speak an event happened.


---
The busy time of the seed trade was over, and
---
that
 preceded the hay- season
---
the quiet weeks had come--.
---
whose very plumes, like those of Juno's bird, are set with
 Argus eyes
---
whenever possible admirers are within ken
---
Time had been.
---
when such instinctive opposition would have taken shape
 in action
---
Elizabeth- Jane started at the question; and
---
it was with some confusion

---
" Oh-- that's right
---
-- that's right....
---
It was only."
---
when we both were there
---
silence should allow
---
There was nothing secret in Elizabeth- Jane's movements beyond what
 habitual reserve induced, and
---
when they
 chanced
---
screened by its enclosure,
---
them meet
---
The meeting, in truth, was of a very innocent kind, and
---
is it not so?"
 
---
that may make a reason for others
---
such as it is
---
My reason, however,,
 is."


---
A secret cast a deep shadow over my life.

---
And well you know."


---
what it was
---
It gives me more pleasure!"


---
" It can not."


---
They proceeded along the road together, and

---
till they reached the town
---
their paths diverged.


---
whatever they might mean
---
which
 their marriage would create
---
The meetings seemed.


---
that nobody was near
---
When they were gone their way
---
The chief looming trouble
 in this engagement had not decreased.
---
But content with the
 prospect as now depicted was hard to acquire.


---
There is an outer chamber of the brain in which thoughts unowned,
 unsolicited, and of noxious kind, are sometimes allowed to wander for a
 moment prior to being sent off whence they came.
---
God forbid such a thing
---
thus early was, naturally enough,
---
, they took a
 kindly interest in their career, not unconnected, perhaps, with visions
 of festive treatment at their hands hereafter.
---
Mrs. Stannidge, having
 rolled into the large parlour one evening and.


---
-- that's
 my opinion.
---
T'other took me in
---
Thus they talked at the Mariners.
---
But we must guard against a too
 liberal use of the conventional declaration that a great sensation was
 caused by the prospective event,,.
---
that all the gossips' tongues were set
 wagging thereby, and so- on
---
even though such a declaration might lend
 some eclat to the career of our poor only heroine
---
When all has been
 said about busy rumourers
---
, a superficial and temporary thing is the
 interest of anybody in affairs which do not directly touch them.
---
It
 would be a truer representation.


---
that Casterbridge( ever excepting
 the nineteen young ladies) looked up for a moment at the news, and

---
whom they would be heartily glad to get out of the way
---
The privilege of being in the house would almost outweigh the personal humiliation.


---
Whether this were a dim possibility or the reverse, the courtship--
---
which
 it evidently now was
---
Two miles out, a quarter of a mile from the highway,
 was the prehistoric fort called Mai Dun, of huge dimensions and many
 ramparts, within or upon whose enclosures a human being as seen from
 the road,.
---
for it was the
 original track laid out by the legions of the Empire-- to a distance of

---
when a masculine figure came along

---
But the lenses revealed.


---
It was one clothed as a merchant captain, and
---
if that could be called a waiting
 which was a transfixture
---
But Elizabeth- Jane did not come.
---
Something
 or other had caused.
---
But what did
 that amount to?
---
" Yes, this little shop can be managed by you alone as well as by us
 both
---
that you disapproved of the
 step
---
," said Henchard huskily.

---
" would be no matter!
---
My
 presence might make things awkward in the future, and, in short
---
If I did not approve it I wish., it is
 best."


---
there existed as yet
 neither word nor event which could argue it away.


---
" you will not be able to come to my wedding;
 and
---
that is not
---
as it ought
---
adding
 more softly," but think of me sometimes in your future life-- you'll do

---
that, Izzy?-- think of me,
 the foremost man in the town, and,
---
WHEN YOU KNOW THEM
 ALL
---
" Promise not to quite
 forget me when----.


---
who had seen

---
as
 weighted by the basket, a perceptible bend
---
which was
 worse than a sob
---
because it was so hard and so dry
---
" Hard work
 would be nothing to me then!
---
But that was not.
---
But my punishment is not
 greater than I can bear!"


---
This was
 evidently not their first meeting that day
---
; they joined hands without
 ceremony, and And and
---
" Well, well, dearie; you will know soon about that.
---
when they reached the Crossways, or
 Bow
---
whom the latter
 had seen
---
It was an affecting one, apart from the question of
 paternity.
---
When the
 true facts came
---
that those facts were true
---
Faith,'
 says I,'
---
all is, and
."


---
as it should be
---
we will have no more deefficulties at all
---
" Now, that's very much
---
you are all right
---
since it can do no harm
---
And is
!"


---
that the wedding may as well be kept under my own roof,
---
the house being
 large, and
---
you being in lodgings by yourself--?-- and' tis a convenience when a
 couple's married not to hae far to go to get home
---
so that a great deal of
 trouble and expense would be saved ye
---
as ye say
---
what we be talking
 about, and
---
as if ye did n't hear
---
how we'll have it
---
as you provide so much, and houseroom, and
---
as many of the folk
 will be ladies, and
---
perhaps they wo n't drink hard enough?
---
But you know best.
---
no want much of that--
---
" Do you leave all to me."


---
When they had gone a little further in these particulars Newson,
---
The old rascal!--he said."


---
Elizabeth- Jane had died years ago
---
" Now, it never crossed my mind
---
if you'll believe me
---
Elizabeth- Jane was amazed at the intelligence.
---
when you
 might have been here
---
that such was the case
---
Thus they conversed; and
---
have pleaded it,
---
" Well, well-- never mind-- it is all over and past
---
It now
 became apparent.


---
The renowned hill whereon the annual fair had been held for so many
 generations was now bare of human beings, and almost of aught besides.
---
A
 few sheep grazed thereabout, but
---
these ran off.
---
" Yes, we came up that way
---
Then we saw the tent--."
---
that must have stood more this way
---
, it was not really
---
where the tent had stood
---
Here we went in, and
---
here we sat down.
---
-- I'll try my luck elsewhere.'
---
It was an
 odd sequence.
---
Out of
 this it happened.
---
imparted by weariness of
 the world
---
in which Casterbridge and Elizabeth- Jane lay
---
the time being
---
O you fool
---
who is no daughter of thine
---
But the ingenious machinery contrived
 by the Gods for reducing human possibilities of amelioration to a
 minimum-- which arranges that wisdom to do shall come pari passu with
 the departure of zest for doing--
---
stood in the way of all that.
---
though
 wanted by their families, the country, and the world
---
wanted by nobody, and
---
despised by
 all
---
the name" Casterbridge" uttered one day by the driver of
 a road- waggon
---
who was a stranger
---
" Yes-- I've come from there, maister,."
---
ye know
---
that's getting so common
---
though, what with this
 travelling without horses, my work will soon be
 done
---
Now is that true or not?"


---
But yes, John-- you forget
---
What
 were them
---
Surely
 they said?"


---
a wedding was coming off soon-- on Martin's Day
---
the waggon went on
 jangling over the hill.


---
The date
 was an extremely probable one
---
, there being no reason for delay on either
 side.
---
was not

---
it to be
---
with which that personality could show nothing in keeping
---
when stiffness would have worn
 off
---
bygones be bygones
---
the working suit-- now stained and

---
distorted by their two months of hard usage
---
A rough yet respectable
 coat and hat, a new shirt and neck- cloth, were the chief of these; and

---
What should that present be?
---
A sheet of newspaper was tied round the little
 creature's wire prison, and
---
It appeared from their accounts
---
that the town band had been hired for
 the evening party, and,
---
lest the convivial instincts of that body
 should get the better of their skill
---
, the further step had been taken of
,.


---
so that there would be a reserve
 of harmony
---
The time was just after twelve o'clock.


---
The place was unchanged
---
; the same larches sighed the same notes; but

---
that Elizabeth- Jane had obtained a better home than had been hers
 at the former time
---
Such an innovation on Casterbridge customs as a flitting of
 bridegroom and bride from the town immediately after the ceremony, was
 not likely, but
---
if it should have taken place
---
if the newly- married couple had gone away, and
---
that they had not
---
was promptly
 informed; they were at that hour,,.


---
it was
 plain to the least observant that festivity prevailed within,
---
Idlers were
 standing on the pavement in front; and
---
It was wide open
---
, the hall was lighted extravagantly, and
---
people were

---
that" a humble old friend" had come
---
which was empty
---
a dance was struck up, and
---
The door of the front room had been taken off its hinges, and
---
whenever their gyrations brought them
 near the doorway, chiefly in the shape of the skirts of dresses and
 streaming curls of hair
---
who had long ago appraised
 life at a moderate value
---
that
 marriage was as a rule no dancing matter
---
However, young people could not be
 quite old people
---
custom was omnipotent.


---
With the progress of the dance the performers spread out somewhat,
 and
---
The pair were not dancing together, but
---
that whenever the chances of the figure made them the partners of a
 moment.


---
their emotions breathed a much subtler essence than at other
 times
---
that the measure was trod by some one
 who out- Farfraed Farfrae in saltatory intenseness
---
This was strange,
 and
---
it was stranger.
---
that the eclipsing personage was
 Elizabeth- Jane's partner
---
, the housekeeper had informed

---
" Oh-- it is-- Mr.
---
What do you
 say?--
---
do n't' ee be so cold as this!
---
you have another-- a real father in my place
---
Then you know all; but

---
Do ye save a little room for me!"


---
You persuaded me; and
---
me to live on in ignorance of the
 truth for years
---
Among the many
 hindrances to such a pleading not the least was this,.


---
Do n't ye distress yourself on my account with
 proud superiority.
---
But it is only for
.
---
It was about a month after the day which closed as in the last chapter.

---
But whether or not because Casterbridge
 was difficult to excite by dramatic returns and disappearances through
.
---
The contiguity of salt water proved.
---
which had a bow- window
---
when the housemaid came in with the announcement
---
how that bird- cage came there
---
that, penetrating
 cautiously into dark cellars,
---
now leaf- strewn by autumn winds
---
how the bird and cage had come
 there
---
though that the poor little songster had been starved to death

---
" Oh, please ma'am, we know.
---
how the bird- cage came there
---
who called on the evening of the wedding
---
' tis thoughted, and."


---
Elizabeth- Jane remembered; and.


---
But then-- as far, that is, as change of emotional basis can justify such
 a radical phrase; and
---
This was enough; and
---
whose gestures
 beamed with mind
---
which the serene Minerva- eyes of one"" made
---
they made further
 inquiries, and
---
who had been working thereabouts
 for weeks
---
Into this road they directed the
 horse's head, and
---
whose surface never had been stirred to a finger's depth,,
---
save by
 the scratchings of rabbits
---
since brushed by the feet of the earliest
 tribes
---
these had left behind, dun and shagged with heather
---
The tumuli,
 jutted roundly into the sky from the uplands,.


---
as though they were the
 full breasts of Diana Multimammia supinely extended there
---
They searched Egdon, but.
---
by
 the afternoon reached the neighbourhood of some extension of the heath
 to the north of Anglebury, a prominent feature of which, in the form of
 a blasted clump of firs on a summit of a hill, they soon passed under.

---
they were following
---
That the road had
---
they were pretty certain
---
which now
 began
---
They were now a score of miles at
 least from home, but,
---
they had just traversed
---
by resting the horse for a couple of hours at a
 village, it would be possible, and
---
that will make
 a hole in a sovereign
---
which the elevated
 position disclosed
---
While they looked a solitary human form
---
The person was some
 labourer
---
If it were not so far away from Casterbridge
---
The possibility led them, and
---
they approached
.
---
what was of humble dwellings surely the humblest
---
The walls, built of
 kneaded clay originally faced with a trowel,.
---
had been worn by years of
 rain- washings to a lumpy crumbling surface, channelled and sunken from
 its plane, its gray rents held together here and there by a leafy strap
 of ivy which could scarcely find substance enough for the purpose
---
The
 rafters were sunken, and the thatch of the roof in ragged holes.
---
Leaves
 from the fence had been blown into the corners of the doorway, and.
---
The door was ajar
---
" What, Abel Whittle; is it?
---
that ye are heere
---
You see."


---
though' a was rough to me
---
" Who are you talking of?"


---
Did n't ye know it?
---
go down street on the night of your worshipful's wedding to the lady at
 yer side, and
---
You go back
---
Do you hear, sir
---
Then' a
 said,'?'
---
Whittle, what do ye follow me for
---
I would
 fain be kind- like to you.'
---
I followed; and We walked on like that all night; and
 in the blue o' the morning
---
By the time we
 had got past here, but
---
that this house was empty as I went
 by
---
can ye
 really be such a poor fond fool
---
some neighbourly woodmen lent me a bed, and a
 chair, and a few other traps, and
---
we brought'em here, and.
---
as we could
---
for you see,

---
One of the neighbours have gone."


---
" Dear me-- is that so!
---
what it is
---
They stood in silence;.
---
On it there was pencilled as
 follows:--


 MICHAEL HENCHARD'S WILL

".

---
"& that no sexton be asked.

---
"& that nobody is wished.
"&.

---
that no murners walk behind me at my funeral.
"&
---
that no flours be planted on my grave,
"&
---
" To this I put my name.

 MICHAEL HENCHARD"


" What are we
---
much if it had not been for my unkindness at that last parting!...
---
But
 there's no altering
---
-- so it must be."


---
was respected as
 far as practicable by Elizabeth- Jane,.
---
who wrote them
---
All was over at last
---
though
 these were deep and sharp for a good while
---
that offer themselves to everybody not in positive
 pain
---
which, thus handled,
---
as wider interests cursorily embraced
---
was no fault of hers.
---
to whom such unbroken tranquility had been
 accorded in the adult stage
